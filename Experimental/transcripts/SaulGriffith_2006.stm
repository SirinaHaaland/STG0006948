SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 54.96 60.91 <NA> <unk> doesn 't mean we should ignore software <unk> or information or computation and that 's in fact probably what i 'm going to
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 60.91 65.87 <NA> try and tell you about <unk> so <unk> this talk is going to be about how do we make things and
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 65.63 71.95 <NA> what what are the new ways that we 're going to make things in the future now ted
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 72 79.37 <NA> sends you a lot of spam if you 're a speaker about do this do that and you fill out all these forms and you don 't actually know how they 're going to describe you
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 80.07 88.35 <NA> it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist <unk> and i 've always been nervous about the term futurist because you seem doomed to failure because you can 't really predict it 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 88.35 95.12 <NA> and i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues i have and said you know well if i have to talk about the future what is it

SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 112.72 119.58 <NA> really crazy but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible <unk> so this isn 't my work but it 's work of
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 119.58 129.55 <NA> good friends of mine at mit this is called the registry of standard biological parts this is headed by drew endy and tom knight and a few other very very bright individuals <unk> basically what they 're doing is looking at biology
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 130.08 139.72 <NA> <unk> as a programmable system literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program <unk> now this is
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 139.72 150.1 <NA> actually becoming such an interesting idea <unk> this is a state diagram that 's an extremely simple computer <unk> this one is a two bit counter so that 's essentially

SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 168.52 174.87 <NA> <unk> and off so this is interesting in the sense that you can now do if then for statements in materials 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 179.93 184.56 <NA> <unk> 's said glibly form follows function but i think i 've sort of grown up in a world <unk>

SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 195.3 204.97 <NA> six years thinking about that but to show you the power of art over science this is actually one of the cartoons i write these are called howtoons i work with a fabulous illustrator called nick dragotta
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 205.19 213.07 <NA> took me six years at mit and about that many pages to to describe what i was doing and it took him one page <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 212.64 218.26 <NA> and so this is our muse tucker he 's an interesting little kid and his sister celine

SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 244.36 250.14 <NA> because this is how we currently make things <unk> this is a silicon wafer and essentially that 's just

SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 275.22 285.7 <NA> <unk> the secret to biology is it builds computation into the way it makes things so this little thing here polymerase is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 285.21 294.88 <NA> dna <unk> and the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins i thought about this in the sense that it 's great to build in biological materials 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 294.88 295.88 <NA> but
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 295.5 297.85 <NA> can we do similar things can we get <unk>
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 298.77 299.93 <NA> <unk> behavior can we

SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 309.01 315.17 <NA> so this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self replicating system
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 315.73 325.05 <NA> <unk> and this is sort of babbage 's revenge these are little mechanical computers these are five state state machines so that 's about three light switches lined
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 325.58 330.39 <NA> <unk> in a neutral state they won 't bind at all now if i make a string of these
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 329.9 336.84 <NA> a bit string they will be able to replicate so we start with white blue blue white that encodes

SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 341.24 353.2 <NA> and then from two comes three and so you 've got this sort of replicating system it was work actually by lionel penrose father of roger penrose the tiles guy he did a lot of this work in the
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 354.99 362.63 <NA> <unk> theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution but it 's now coming back so now i 'm going to show you the hands free autonomous self replication 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 362.63 367.42 <NA> so we 've tracked in the video the input string which was green green yellow yellow green <unk>
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 367.08 370.24 <NA> we set them off on this air hockey table
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 370.29 372.77 <NA> <unk> you know high science uses air hockey tables
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 379.84 385.34 <NA> <unk> parts bin that you have here <unk> so we 've got autonomous replication of
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 385.03 389.03 <NA> of bit strings so why would you want to replicate
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 388.54 400.13 <NA> bit strings <unk> well <unk> it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme that you can take a linear string which is a convenient thing to copy and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3d structure <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 399.64 404.76 <NA> so i was trying to you know <unk> take the engineer 's version can we build a mechanical system
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 404.99 411.81 <NA> <unk> in inorganic materials that will do the same thing so what i 'm showing you here is that we can make a 2d shape
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 411.61 421.89 <NA> the b assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules and the the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here and the incredibly simple <unk>
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 421.79 429.64 <NA> <unk> state machines in the previous design was that you don 't need digital logic to do computation and that way you can scale things much smaller than
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 429.81 438.04 <NA> <unk> microchips so you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process <unk> so <unk> neil gershenfeld showed you this video
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 437.73 441.64 <NA> on wednesday i believe but i 'll show you again
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 441.51 449.9 <NA> this is literally the colored sequence of those tiles each different color has a different magnetic polarity <unk> and the sequence is uniquely
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 451.21 461.03 <NA> <unk> the structure that is coming out now hopefully those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3d structure 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 460.9 474.81 <NA> and in fact you know <unk> i can now take a dog carve it up and then reassemble it so it 's a linear string that will fold from a sequence and now i can actually define that three dimensional object as a sequence
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 478.58 490.02 <NA> <unk> it 's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently <unk> and the universe is now a compiler <unk> and so i 'm thinking about you know what are the programs for programming the physical universe
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 489.65 500.26 <NA> <unk> and how do we think about materials and structure <unk> sort of as an information and computation problem not just where you attach a micro controller to the end point but that the structure
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 508.08 518.43 <NA> <unk> totally absorbed this philosophy i started looking at a lot of problems a little differently <unk> with the universe as a computer you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations you set a couple of boundary conditions 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 518.43 522.2 <NA> like gravity the surface tension <unk> density etc 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 522.02 525.2 <NA> and then you press execute and magically the universe produces
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 525.16 530.94 <NA> <unk> you a perfect ball lens <unk> so this actually applied to the problem of so there 's
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 530.94 535.98 <NA> a half a billion to a billion people in the world don 't have access to cheap eyeglasses so
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 535.79 540.74 <NA> can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 540.49 549.96 <NA> on site <unk> this is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition if it 's circular you make a spherical lens if it 's elliptical you can make an astigmatic
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 551.51 555.99 <NA> <unk> you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure so that 's part of the extra program 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 555.99 566.5 <NA> and literally with only those two inputs so the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error from
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 566.11 574.11 <NA> minus twelve to plus eight diopters up to four diopters of cylinder <unk> and then literally you now pour on a monomer <unk> you know i
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 574.1 576.85 <NA> 'll do a julia childs here this is three minutes of
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 580.29 583.93 <NA> you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you 've cooked it 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 584.52 589.39 <NA> pop it out i 've seen this video but i still don 't know if it 's going to end right 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 590.61 595.1 <NA> so you reverse this this is a very old movie so with the new prototypes 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 595.1 600.05 <NA> actually both surfaces are flexible but this will show you the point now you 've finished
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 607.78 617.18 <NA> <unk> and you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters and as i rotate it against this side shot you 'll see that that has cylinder and that was programmed in literally
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 616.72 624.9 <NA> into the physics of the system <unk> so this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 625.19 627.78 <NA> <unk> leads to other things like
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 627.71 629.71 <NA> this this is something that
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 629.53 640.6 <NA> my people at squid labs are working on at the moment called electronic rope so literally you think about a rope it has very complex structure in the weave and under no load it 's one structure under a different load it 's a different structure 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 640.6 643.51 <NA> and you can actually exploit that by putting in a very
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 643.3 654.97 <NA> small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor so this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope just by thinking about the physics of the world materials
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 654.99 657.16 <NA> <unk> as the computer you can start to
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 656.79 658.75 <NA> do things like this 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 659.04 661.69 <NA> i 'm going to segue a little here <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 661.69 669.22 <NA> i guess i 'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that i think about with this one thing i 'm really interested about this right now is how
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 668.82 674.78 <NA> <unk> if you 're really taking this view of the universe as a computer how do we make things in a very general
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 676.33 678.35 <NA> <unk> might we share the way we make
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 678.18 690.41 <NA> things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware and a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems share the information and work on those things together 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 690.41 699.93 <NA> so a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time and unless lisa randall changes that we 'll continue to move in in linear time <unk> so that means anything you do or anything you
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 701.36 708.75 <NA> <unk> sequence of steps and i think lego in the ' 70s nailed this and they did it most elegantly <unk> but they can show you how to build things
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 708.98 711.15 <NA> in sequence so 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 710.9 716.98 <NA> i 'm thinking about how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things so you end up with this sort of guy 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 716.98 720.18 <NA> right and i think this applies across a very broad
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 720.74 728.35 <NA> sort of a lot of concepts you know cameron sinclair yesterday said how do i get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 729.99 733.03 <NA> <unk> you 've seen amy smith she talks about how you get
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 733.2 743.29 <NA> students at mit to work with communities in haiti <unk> and i think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things <unk>
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 743.24 751.55 <NA> <unk> so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other 's source code for structure i don 't know exactly how to do this yet but
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 756.22 761.96 <NA> so you know that leads to questions like is this a compiler is this a sub routine 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 761.47 765.41 <NA> interesting things like that maybe i 'm getting a little too abstract but you know 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 766.12 779.7 <NA> this is the sort of returning to our comic characters this is sort of the universe or a different universe view that i think is going to be very prevalent in the future from biotech to materials assembly it was great to hear bill joy they 're starting to invest in materials science but these are the
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 779.96 794.7 <NA> <unk> new things in materials science how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas and see the world in a different way and it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe it 's sort of an analog computer <unk> but it 's definitely an interesting new

SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 796.64 804.94 <NA> i 've gone too far <unk> so that sounds like it 's it i 've probably got a couple of minutes of questions or i can show i think they also said that i do extreme
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 805.46 809.17 <NA> in the introduction so i may have to explain that 
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 809.58 815.41 <NA> so maybe i 'll do that with this this short video <unk> so this is actually
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 818.43 825.02 <NA> <unk> a 3 000 square foot kite which also happens to be a minimal energy surface so returning to the droplet again thinking about the universe in a new way <unk> this is
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 825.04 827.96 <NA> <unk> kite designed by a guy called dave kulp <unk> and why do you want a <unk>
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 828.88 835.49 <NA> <unk> kite so that 's a kite the size of your house <unk> and so you want that to tow boats very fast
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 835.12 842.39 <NA> so i 've been working on this a little also with a couple of other guys <unk> but you know this is another way to look at the
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 842.11 844.31 <NA> if you abstract again
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 843.94 857.37 <NA> <unk> this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe you could just hang it as a bed sheet but again the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape <unk> and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that
SaulGriffith_2006 1 SaulGriffith_2006 857.37 860.94 <NA> <unk> so that that 's sort of another interesting aspect of the
