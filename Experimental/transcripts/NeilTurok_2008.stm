NeilTurok_2008 1 NeilTurok_2008 462.85 472.55 <NA> well i got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question which is what happens if these two three dimensional worlds should actually collide <unk>

NeilTurok_2008 1 NeilTurok_2008 479.99 486.12 <NA> <unk> conventional picture of the big bang is a point everything comes out of a point you have infinite density
