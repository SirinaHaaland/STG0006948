LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 12.79 20.01 <NA> <unk> what i 'm going to try and do in the next fifteen minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we 're going to make matter come alive <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 20.01 24.86 <NA> now this may seem a bit ambitious <unk> but when you look at yourself you look at your hands <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 25 28.29 <NA> <unk> realize that you 're alive <unk> so this is a start 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 27.95 35.51 <NA> now this quest started four billion years ago on planet earth there 's been four billion years of organic biological life 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 35.29 44.53 <NA> and as an inorganic chemist my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic living world and the inorganic dead world 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 44.53 54.28 <NA> and what i 'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic dead matter into living matter into inorganic biology
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 54.9 58.99 <NA> <unk> before we do that i want to kind of put biology in its place <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 58.53 68.26 <NA> and i 'm absolutely enthralled by biology <unk> i love to do synthetic biology i love things that are alive <unk> i love manipulating the infrastructure of biology <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 67.83 74.75 <NA> but within that infrastructure we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 75.64 80.16 <NA> <unk> and evolution although it was established well over one hundred years ago by charles darwin
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 79.98 85.1 <NA> and a vast number of other people evolution still is a little bit intangible 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 84.73 91.91 <NA> and when i talk about darwinian evolution i mean one thing and one thing only and that is survival of the fittest <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 91.91 98.67 <NA> and so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way think about evolution in terms of offspring
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 98.49 100.08 <NA> competing and some
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 101.27 109.54 <NA> <unk> so bearing that in mind as a chemist i wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology <unk> what is the minimal unit
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 109.36 119.46 <NA> of matter that can undergo darwinian evolution <unk> and this seems quite a profound question <unk> and as a chemist we 're not used to profound questions every day <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 119 121.11 <NA> so when i thought about it 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 121.4 125.29 <NA> then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 125.43 133.03 <NA> <unk> and in fact the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is in fact a single cell a bacteria <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 133.41 142.12 <NA> so this raises three really important questions what is life is biology special biologists seem to think so 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 141.84 149.65 <NA> is matter evolvable <unk> now if we answer those questions in reverse order the third question is matter evolvable <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 149.65 154.97 <NA> if we can answer that then we 're going to know how special biology is and maybe just maybe
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 154.69 158.39 <NA> <unk> maybe we 'll have some idea of what life really is 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 158.95 165.77 <NA> so here 's some inorganic life this is a dead crystal and i 'm going to do something to it and it 's going to become alive <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 166.42 171.17 <NA> and you can see it 's kind of pollinating germinating growing 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 170.95 179.04 <NA> this is an inorganic tube <unk> and all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago and they look alive <unk> of course they 're not alive
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 179.72 187.44 <NA> <unk> experiment where i 've made a crystal garden <unk> but when i saw this i was really fascinated because it seemed lifelike and
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 187.49 190.74 <NA> as i pause for a few seconds have a look at the screen <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 192.44 196.08 <NA> you can see there 's architecture growing <unk> filling the void <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 195.65 204.97 <NA> and this is dead so i was positive that if somehow we can make things mimic life <unk> let 's go one step further let 's see if we can actually make life
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 205.13 207.35 <NA> <unk> but there 's a problem because
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 207.14 217.93 <NA> up until maybe a decade ago we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe in fact we were the only people in the universe <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 217.56 224.99 <NA> now that 's a bit boring <unk> so as a chemist <unk> i wanted to say hang on what is going on here is life
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 226.9 229.37 <NA> <unk> this is really the question <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 228.88 238.97 <NA> i think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars <unk> and in fact let 's take that one step further <unk> let <unk>
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 238.87 246.6 <NA> <unk> 's say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe maybe the physics of life is as well <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 254.92 265.23 <NA> and in a universe where carbon exists and organic biology <unk> then we have all this wonderful diversity of life in fact <unk> we have such amazing <unk>
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 265.13 271.14 <NA> <unk> lifeforms that we can manipulate we 're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 276.81 278.75 <NA> <unk> a serious question if your pen
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 278.54 288.4 <NA> could replicate that would be a bit of a problem <unk> so we have to think differently if we 're going to make stuff come alive and we also have to be aware of the issues <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 288.48 294.31 <NA> but before we can make life let 's think for a second what life really is characterized by 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 293.91 300.04 <NA> and forgive the complicated diagram this is just a collection of pathways in the cell <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 300.07 306.02 <NA> <unk> and the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing synthetic biologists are manipulating it 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 305.85 316.07 <NA> chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease and you have all these pathways going on at the same time you have regulation <unk> information is transcribed <unk> catalysts <unk>
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 315.97 329.97 <NA> <unk> are made stuff is happening <unk> but what does a cell do well it divides it competes it survives <unk> and i think that is where we have to start in terms of thinking about building from our ideas in life <unk> but what else is life
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 329.99 335.46 <NA> <unk> characterized by well i like think of it as a flame in a bottle <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 335.06 345.57 <NA> and so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating <unk> metabolizing burning through chemistries <unk> and so we have to understand that if we 're going to make <unk>
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 345.52 350.23 <NA> artificial life or understand the origin of life we need to power it somehow 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 354.93 365.86 <NA> <unk> from and darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere maybe not in scotland maybe in africa maybe somewhere else 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 365.86 369.16 <NA> but the real honest answer is we just don 't know <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 369.15 374.99 <NA> because there is a problem with the origin imagine way back four and a half billion years ago <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 375.37 377.44 <NA> <unk> vast chemical soup of stuff 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 377.44 388.97 <NA> and from this stuff we came <unk> so when you think about the improbable nature of what i 'm going to tell you in the next few minutes just remember we came from stuff on planet earth <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 388.48 398.84 <NA> and we went through a variety of worlds the rna people would talk about the rna world <unk> we somehow got to proteins and dna <unk> we then got to the last ancestor 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 398.47 399.99 <NA> evolution kicked
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 400.55 403.23 <NA> <unk> and that 's the cool bit and here we are 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 403.55 415.5 <NA> but there 's a roadblock that you can 't get past you can decode the genome you can look back you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna <unk> but we can 't get further than the last ancestor 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 415.5 416.62 <NA> the last

LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 418.46 422.58 <NA> sequence or think back in history <unk> so we don 't know
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 422.09 424.63 <NA> how we got here <unk> so there are two
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 425.97 430.27 <NA> <unk> intelligent design direct and indirect so god or
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 430.07 433.03 <NA> my friend <unk> now
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 432.86 441.13 <NA> talking about e t putting us there or some other life just pushes the problem further on i 'm not a politician i 'm a scientist 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 440.94 447.52 <NA> the other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity this seems most likely <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 447.03 454.82 <NA> so we have some kind of primordial soup <unk> and this one happens to be a good source of all twenty amino acids <unk> and somehow
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 454.84 464.69 <NA> these amino acids are combined and life begins <unk> but life begins what does that mean what is life what is this stuff of life <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 464.41 465.83 <NA> so in the <unk>
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 467.11 475.32 <NA> <unk> did their fantastic chemical frankenstein experiment where they did the equivalent in the chemical world <unk> they took the basic ingredients
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 475.37 478.38 <NA> <unk> put them in a single jar and ignited them
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 477.98 485.04 <NA> and put a lot of voltage through <unk> and they had a look at what was in the soup <unk> and they found amino acids <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 484.7 490.65 <NA> but nothing came out there was no cell <unk> so the whole area 's been stuck for a while <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 490.65 496.59 <NA> and it got reignited in the ' 80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 496.25 500.01 <NA> in my own laboratory the way we 're trying to create
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 499.67 504.94 <NA> inorganic life is by using many different reaction formats <unk> so what we 're trying to do is
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 504.87 511.59 <NA> <unk> do reactions not in one flask but in tens of flasks and connect them together as you can see with this flow system all these pipes 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 511.6 518.39 <NA> we can do it microfluidically we can do it lithographically we can do it in a 3d printer we can do it in droplets for colleagues 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 518.21 523.36 <NA> and the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 523.05 524.48 <NA> but
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 526.21 529.49 <NA> <unk> going to end in failure <unk> so we need to be a bit more focused 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 529.03 536.57 <NA> and the answer of course lies with mice this is how i remember what i need as a chemist i say well i want molecules 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 536.08 539.63 <NA> but i need a metabolism i need some energy <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 539.2 546.32 <NA> i need some information <unk> and i need a container because if i want evolution i need containers to compete <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 545.95 548.63 <NA> so if you have a container
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 548.35 550.02 <NA> <unk> it 's like getting
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 550.55 560.13 <NA> <unk> this is my car <unk> and i 'm going to drive around and show off my car and i imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 559.82 561.72 <NA> so these things together
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 561.55 567.54 <NA> give us evolution perhaps <unk> and the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 567.29 574.87 <NA> so what we 're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic lego kit of molecules and so forgive the molecules on the screen <unk> but these are a
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 575 585.1 <NA> simple kit there 's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present and we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano molecular molecules <unk>
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 585.05 591.04 <NA> the same size of dna and proteins <unk> but there 's no carbon in sight carbon is banned <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 600.37 609.26 <NA> <unk> we need to make some containers and just a few months ago in my lab we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them and you can see on the screen a
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 609.06 616.35 <NA> cell being made and we 're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell <unk> and all i wanted to show you is we can set up
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 616.35 624.9 <NA> molecules in membranes in real cells and then it sets up a kind of molecular darwinism a molecular survival of the
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 626.03 631.96 <NA> <unk> and this movie here shows this competition between molecules molecules are competing for stuff they
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 631.72 635.56 <NA> 're all made of the same stuff but they want their shape to win <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 635.32 639.15 <NA> they want their shape to persist <unk> and that is the key 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 639.15 648.21 <NA> if we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete <unk> they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 648.77 654.88 <NA> if we manage to do that forget the molecular detail <unk> let 's zoom out to what that could mean
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 654.93 660.5 <NA> so we have this special theory of evolution that applies only to organic biology <unk> to us 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 660.5 666.68 <NA> if we could get evolution into the material world then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 666.45 668.89 <NA> and that 's really worth thinking about 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 669 679.01 <NA> does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 679.93 683.96 <NA> <unk> that means we could then start to develop different platforms
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 683.73 691.82 <NA> for exploring this evolution so you imagine if we 're able to create a self sustaining artificial life form
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 691.57 699.11 <NA> not only will this tell us about the origin of life that it 's possible that the universe doesn 't need carbon to be alive it can use anything
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 698.77 704.97 <NA> we can then take [ it ] one step further and develop new technologies because we can then use software control for evolution
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 705.02 711.91 <NA> <unk> to code in so imagine we make a little cell we want to put it out in the environment and we want it to be powered by the sun 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 711.91 715.38 <NA> what we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 714.92 725.26 <NA> and we don 't use design anymore we find what works we should take our inspiration from biology <unk> biology doesn 't care about the design unless it works
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 725.43 728.38 <NA> <unk> so this will reorganize the way we design things 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 728.15 735.8 <NA> but not only just that we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 735.62 743.9 <NA> wouldn 't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn 't really deal with 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 743.9 748.82 <NA> the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 748.61 754.94 <NA> everything <unk> because it 's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution evolution cannot be cut apart
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 754.95 758.36 <NA> you need to somehow find the fitness function <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 758.36 768.2 <NA> and the profound realization for me is that if this works the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level <unk> and we really start talking about selfish matter and
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 767.83 775.07 <NA> what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff you 're sitting on chairs
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 775.13 777.03 <NA> <unk> they 're inanimate <unk> they 're not alive <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 776.86 787.23 <NA> but you are made of stuff and you are using stuff <unk> and you enslave stuff <unk> so using evolution in in biology <unk> and in inorganic biology <unk> for <unk>
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 787.13 796.78 <NA> <unk> me is quite appealing quite exciting and we 're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 801.24 805.72 <NA> <unk> five billion years ago we were not here and there was no life <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 805.26 814.07 <NA> so what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life <unk> but perhaps for me as a chemist <unk> i want to keep away from
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 813.59 818.68 <NA> general terms i want to think about specifics so what does it mean about defining life <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 818.4 825.35 <NA> we really struggle to do this and i think if we can make inorganic biology <unk> and we can make matter become evolvable
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 825.52 832.23 <NA> <unk> that will in fact define life i propose to you that matter that can evolve is alive <unk> 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 832.23 836.07 <NA> and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter <unk> thank you very much
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 854.9 861.87 <NA> <unk> millions of years to kick in we 're proposing to do it in just a few hours <unk> once we 've set up the right
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 862.04 867.33 <NA> chemistry ca and when do you think that will happen lc hopefully within the next two years ca 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 868.01 870.36 <NA> that would be a big story 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 871.82 876.88 <NA> in your own mind what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 880.05 887.85 <NA> <unk> i think it 's one hundred percent <unk> because the thing is we are so chauvinistic to biology <unk> if you take away carbon there 's other things that can happen 
LeeCronin_2011G 1 LeeCronin_2011G 887.86 897.17 <NA> so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon maybe we can tell nasa what really to look for don 't go and look for carbon go and look for evolvable stuff
