CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 57.44 66.91 <NA> some time ago has such interesting prospects mainly we want to talk about the future <unk> so my first question where is google and where is it going lp well this
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 66.57 71.12 <NA> is something we think about a lot and our mission
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 70.94 74.47 <NA> we defined a long time ago is to organize the world 's information
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 74.04 78.95 <NA> and make it universally accessible and useful <unk> and people always say
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 80.01 85.73 <NA> that really what you guys are still doing <unk> and i always kind of think about that myself and i 'm not quite sure but
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 85.9 87.74 <NA> actually 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 87.52 92.96 <NA> when i think about search <unk> it 's such a deep thing for all of us 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 92.74 97.31 <NA> to really understand what you want to understand the world 's information 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 97.24 102.6 <NA> and we 're still very much in the early stages of that which is totally crazy
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 105.14 112.83 <NA> but it 's not at all done cr when it 's done how will it be lp well 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 113.24 116.46 <NA> i guess in thinking about where we 're going you
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 116.57 124.54 <NA> know why is it not done a lot of it is just computing 's kind of a mess you know your computer doesn 't know where you are it doesn 't know

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 139.38 141.98 <NA> so really having computing
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 141.53 143.79 <NA> work and understand you
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 143.63 145.84 <NA> and understand that information we

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 161.47 166.13 <NA> u k first let me tell you the way we got there <unk> which was
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 165.67 174.59 <NA> looking at search and really understanding trying to understand everything <unk> and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 174.25 179.16 <NA> like voice was really important so what 's the state of the art on speech recognition
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 179.99 181.14 <NA> <unk> very good it
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 181.16 186.69 <NA> doesn 't really understand you so we started doing machine learning research to improve that 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 186.5 194.28 <NA> that helped a lot <unk> and we started just looking at things like youtube can we understand youtube but we actually
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 193.88 200.05 <NA> ran machine learning on youtube and it discovered cats just by itself now that 's an
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 203.4 210.16 <NA> <unk> we realized there 's really something here if we can learn what cats are that must be really important so i think
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 210.18 215.83 <NA> deep mind <unk> what 's really amazing about deep mind is that it can actually
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 215.76 221.95 <NA> they 're learning things in this unsupervised way they started with video games 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 221.94 226.66 <NA> and really just maybe i can show the video <unk> just playing video games 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 226.47 228.65 <NA> and learning how to do that automatically
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 229.96 239 <NA> <unk> games and how machines are coming to be able to to do some remarkable things lp the amazing thing about this is this is i mean obviously these are

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 270.59 274.99 <NA> so imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule or

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 279.21 288.53 <NA> we 're really just at the beginning of that <unk> and that 's what what i 'm really excited about cr when you look at at all that 's taken place with deep mind and
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 288.05 291.89 <NA> and the boxing also a part of where we 're going
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 291.71 298.67 <NA> is artificial intelligence where are we <unk> when you look at that lp well i think
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 298.67 302.71 <NA> for me this is kind of one of the most exciting things i 've seen in a long time
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 302.4 304.04 <NA> the guy who started this company

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 315.04 322.34 <NA> going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 322.24 324.86 <NA> what it takes to make something smart
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 325 334.95 <NA> <unk> and do really interesting things cr but where 's the level of it now and how fast do you think we are moving lp well this is the state of the art right now
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 334.73 342.75 <NA> understanding cats on youtube and things like that improving voice recognition <unk> we used a lot of machine learning
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 342.35 350.8 <NA> to improve things incrementally but i think for me this example 's really exciting because it 's one program
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 350.8 354.85 <NA> that can do a lot of different things cr i don 't know if we can do this but we 've got the image of
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 354.87 362.14 <NA> <unk> cat it would be wonderful to see this this is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with can we see that image lp yeah cr 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 361.71 369.94 <NA> there it is can you see the cat <unk> designed by machines seen by machines lp that 's right so this is learned from just watching youtube 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 369.48 373.63 <NA> and there 's no training no notion of a cat but
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 373.38 376.91 <NA> this concept of a cat is something important
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 379.9 386.94 <NA> <unk> can kind of understand maybe just finishing also on the search part it started with search really understanding
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 386.94 391.58 <NA> people 's context and their information i did have a video
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 391.27 393.15 <NA> i wanted to show quickly on that
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 404.93 411.96 <NA> <unk> then suddenly they started dying one after the other i checked out the books and they didn 't tell me much <unk> so i went and <unk>

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 436.98 445.58 <NA> so i went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites <unk> when i met him next he was going to put a windmill
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 445.34 451.66 <NA> at the local school <unk> i felt proud because something that wasn 't there before
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 451.2 453.89 <NA> was suddenly there i
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 455.08 457.79 <NA> <unk> that not everybody can be able to access
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 457.62 465.26 <NA> what i was able to access i thought that i need to have an internet that my grandmother can use <unk> so i thought about a notice board
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 464.77 474.78 <NA> <unk> a simple wooden notice board <unk> when i get information on my phone i 'm able to post the information on the notice board <unk> so it 's basically like a computer

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 515.85 525.02 <NA> <unk> amazing thing about that video actually was we just read about it in the news and we found this gentlemen and made that little clip cr when i talk to people about you
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 525.04 531.28 <NA> <unk> they say to me people who know you well say <unk> larry wants to change the world and he believes technology

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 533.2 543.9 <NA> <unk> and that means access to the internet it has to do with languages it also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community <unk> and this is an example
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 554.9 562.08 <NA> <unk> released this loon project which is using balloons to do it it sounds totally crazy we can show the video here
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 562.01 568.59 <NA> actually two out of three people in the world don 't have good internet access now <unk> we actually think this can really help people <unk>
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 570.83 574.62 <NA> it 's a balloon lp yeah <unk> get access to the internet
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 575.61 584.57 <NA> <unk> why does this balloon give you access to the internet because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible they didn 't have to be tethered lp 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 584.57 587.83 <NA> yeah and this is a good example of innovation like 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 587.88 595.13 <NA> we 've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it but it was just really how do we get
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 594.93 600.02 <NA> access points up high cheaply you normally have to use satellites and it takes a
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 602.74 607.13 <NA> <unk> saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up and
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 606.88 610.31 <NA> actually again it 's the power of the internet i did a search on it 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 609.94 616.76 <NA> and i found <unk> thirty forty years ago someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the earth multiple times and
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 616.78 619.85 <NA> i thought why can 't we do that today <unk> 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 619.69 626.66 <NA> and that 's how this project got going cr but are you at the mercy of the wind lp yeah but it turns out 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 626.47 629.79 <NA> we did some weather simulations which probably hadn 't really been
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 629.75 635.76 <NA> <unk> before <unk> and if you control the altitude of the balloons which you can do by pumping air into them
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 635.39 643.86 <NA> and other ways you can actually control roughly where they go and so i think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 643.85 650.08 <NA> that can cover the whole planet cr before i talk about the future and transportation where you 've been a nerd for a while <unk> 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 650.01 657.05 <NA> <unk> and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles <unk> let me talk a bit about what 's been the subject here earlier
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 656.84 664.09 <NA> with edward snowden it is security and privacy you have to have been thinking about that lp 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 663.69 669.74 <NA> yeah absolutely i saw the picture of sergey with edward snowden yesterday some of you may have seen
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 669.41 677.02 <NA> it but i think for me i guess privacy and security are a really important thing 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 677.34 679.79 <NA> we think about it in terms of both things
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 679.83 686.9 <NA> and i think you can 't have privacy without security so let me just talk about security first because you asked about snowden and
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 686.9 691.73 <NA> all of that and then i 'll say a little bit about privacy <unk> i think
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 691.57 701.15 <NA> for me <unk> it 's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn 't tell us <unk> i don 't think we can have a democracy

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 722.75 727.62 <NA> and i think we haven 't had that conversation so i think the government 's actually done
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 727.43 729.79 <NA> itself a tremendous disservice
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 730.11 732.1 <NA> <unk> by doing all that in secret cr 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 731.67 740.59 <NA> never coming to google to ask for anything lp not google but the public <unk> i think we need to have a debate about that 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 740.94 750.02 <NA> or we can 't have a functioning democracy it 's just not possible <unk> so i 'm sad that google 's in the position of protecting you and our users

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 784.51 790.5 <NA> i think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice show them what data 's being collected

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 854.99 861.26 <NA> they could see you could see which doctor accessed it and why and you could maybe learn about
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 861.27 866.23 <NA> what conditions you have i think if we just did that we 'd save one hundred thousand lives this year

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 919.54 921.66 <NA> yeah i guess i was just
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 921.42 927.08 <NA> frustrated with this when i was at college in michigan i had to get on the bus and take it and

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1036.11 1037.54 <NA> is actually
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1037.54 1041.25 <NA> how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1046.01 1049.9 <NA> anyway it looks totally crazy but i was actually
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1050.04 1058 <NA> <unk> about our campus working with the zippies and stuff and just trying to get a lot more bike usage <unk> and i was thinking about how do you

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1065.43 1074.69 <NA> that particular thing but it gets your imagination going cr let me close with this give me a sense of the philosophy of your own mind you have this idea of [ google

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1078.04 1081.86 <NA> to go in some small measurable
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1081.61 1085.76 <NA> arena of progress lp yeah i think
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1085.39 1090.35 <NA> many of the things we just talked about are like that where they 're really i
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1090.16 1096.72 <NA> almost use the economic concept of additionality which means that you 're doing something
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1096.49 1100.4 <NA> that wouldn 't happen unless you were actually doing it <unk> and
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1100.39 1104.19 <NA> i think the more you can do things like that the bigger impact you have
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1106.34 1109.17 <NA> and that 's about doing things that
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1108.89 1115.41 <NA> people might not think are possible <unk> and i 've been amazed <unk> the more i learn about technology <unk> 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1115.07 1120.6 <NA> the more i realize i don 't know <unk> and that 's because this technological horizon <unk> 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1120.5 1124.81 <NA> the thing that you can see to do next <unk> the more you learn about

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1130.07 1138.79 <NA> because there 's some material that will work for them cr what 's interesting about you too though for me is that we have lots of people who are thinking about the future 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1138.87 1144.79 <NA> and they are going and looking and they 're coming back but we never see the implementation
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1144.3 1151.96 <NA> i think of somebody you knew and read about <unk> tesla <unk> the principle of that for you is
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1151.51 1152.51 <NA> what
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1154.93 1161.72 <NA> <unk> if you invent something tesla invented electric power that we use but he struggled to get it out to people
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1161.65 1169.97 <NA> that had to be done by other people it took a long time <unk> and i think if we can actually combine both things where we have
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1169.51 1178.88 <NA> an innovation and invention focus <unk> plus the ability to really a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1178.51 1179.97 <NA> in a way that 's positive
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1180.17 1181.35 <NA> <unk> for the world
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1180.95 1184.98 <NA> and to give people hope you know i 'm amazed
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1184.58 1190.83 <NA> with the loon project just how excited people were about that because it gave them hope
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1190.43 1193.5 <NA> for the two thirds of the world that doesn 't have internet right now
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1193.52 1203.23 <NA> that 's any good cr which is a second thing about corporations you are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1204.96 1214.33 <NA> <unk> most people think companies are basically evil they get a bad rap <unk> and i think that 's somewhat correct companies are doing the same
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1214.33 1217.33 <NA> incremental thing that they did fifty years ago
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1216.9 1220.93 <NA> or twenty years ago that 's not really what we need we need
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1220.53 1224.96 <NA> especially in technology we need revolutionary change not
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1225.79 1234.38 <NA> <unk> you once said actually as i think i 've got this about right that you might consider rather than giving your money <unk> if you were leaving it to some
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1233.98 1240.44 <NA> cause just simply giving it to elon musk <unk> because you had confidence that he would change the future 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1240.44 1247.37 <NA> and that you would therefore lp yeah if you want to go mars he wants to go to mars to back up humanity 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1246.94 1250.07 <NA> that 's a worthy goal but it 's a company <unk> and it 's
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1251.84 1253.14 <NA> <unk> so i think
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1252.68 1258.79 <NA> we aim to do kind of similar things and i think you ask we have a lot of employees at google
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1258.55 1261.3 <NA> who have become pretty wealthy <unk> 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1260.96 1269.73 <NA> people make a lot of money in technology a lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy you 're working because you want to change the world you want to make it better
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1269.39 1273.21 <NA> why isn 't the company that you work for
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1272.72 1279.1 <NA> worthy not just of your time but your money as well <unk> i mean but we don 't have a concept of that
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1279.98 1284.44 <NA> think about companies <unk> and i think it 's sad because companies
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1284.16 1286.48 <NA> are most of our effort they
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1286.11 1290.98 <NA> 're where most of people 's time is where a lot of the money is 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1290.49 1297.97 <NA> and so i think i 'd like for us to help out more than we are cr when i close conversations with lots of people i always ask this question
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1297.51 1304.88 <NA> <unk> what state of mind <unk> what quality of mind is it that has served you best people like rupert murdoch have said

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1315.57 1320.9 <NA> to think about the future and at the same time change the present lp

CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1333.29 1338.13 <NA> did those companies all do wrong <unk> and usually it 's just that they missed the future 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1338.51 1340.29 <NA> and so i think 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1340.28 1349.06 <NA> for me i just try to focus on that and say <unk> what is that future really going to be and how do we create it and how do we
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1348.88 1354.22 <NA> cause our organization our organization to really focus on
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1354.96 1360.7 <NA> <unk> and drive that at a really high rate <unk> and so that 's been curiosity it 's been
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1360.27 1364.6 <NA> looking at things people might not think about working on things that
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1364.17 1369.49 <NA> no one else is working on because that 's where the additionality really is 
CharlieRose_2014 1 CharlieRose_2014 1369.09 1374.87 <NA> and be willing to do that to take that risk look at android i felt guilty
