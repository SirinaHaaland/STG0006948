ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 174.7 179.91 <NA> and so government officials like british prime minister david cameron they believe

ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 208.89 214.66 <NA> the reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop or a drug dealer 's cell phone 
ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 214.66 218.35 <NA> we all use the same communications devices 
ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 218.1 220.61 <NA> what that means is that if
ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 220.41 224.93 <NA> the drug dealers ' telephone calls or the terrorists ' telephone calls can be intercepted <unk> then
ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 225 233.36 <NA> so can the rest of ours too and i think we really need to ask <unk> should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly 
ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 234.82 244.67 <NA> so the the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that i 've described this is not imaginary in two thousand and nine the surveillance systems that google <unk>
ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 244.62 254.97 <NA> and microsoft built into their networks the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police those systems were compromised by the chinese government because the chinese

ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 270.73 277.02 <NA> and that feature the surveillance feature was used to wiretap the greek prime minister and members of the greek cabinet

ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 281.52 294.73 <NA> and really this gets to the very problem with with these surveillance features or backdoors <unk> when you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology you have no way of controlling who 's going to go through it

ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 307.81 316.95 <NA> yes this means that in the future encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult <unk> it means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys <unk> 
ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2015U 316.95 328.71 <NA> but the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone 's calls or anyone 's text messages could be surveilled by criminals by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies <unk> and i don 't want to live in that kind of world
