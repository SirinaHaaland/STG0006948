RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 17.68 25.05 <NA> <unk> he 's our son he was born two and a half years ago and i had a pretty tough pregnancy
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 25.61 28.98 <NA> <unk> had to stay still in a bed for like eight months
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 28.81 40.32 <NA> but in the end everything seemed to be under control so he got the right weight at birth he got the right apgar index so we were pretty reassured by
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 40.04 41.76 <NA> this but
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 42.05 50.04 <NA> at the end ten days later after he was born we discovered that he had a stroke
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 50.31 54.32 <NA> <unk> as you might know a stroke is a brain injury
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 54.32 63.79 <NA> a perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 63.42 67.33 <NA> and in his case as you can see the right
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 67.02 70.09 <NA> part of his brain has gone
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 70.11 79.94 <NA> so the effect that this stroke could have on mario 's body could be the fact that he couldn 't be able to control the left
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 79.87 81.95 <NA> <unk> side of his body
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 81.85 86.85 <NA> just imagine if you have a computer and a printer and
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 86.85 94.4 <NA> you want to transmit to input to print out a document but the printer doesn 't have the right drives so
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 94.12 103.77 <NA> the same is for mario it 's just like he would like to move his left side of his body but he 's not able to transmit the right input to move his
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 105.2 113.94 <NA> <unk> arm and left leg so life had to change we needed to change our schedule we needed to change
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 114.08 116.85 <NA> the impact that
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 116.36 125.43 <NA> this birth had on our life roberto d 'angelo as you may imagine unfortunately we were not ready
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 125.03 130 <NA> nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities and as many
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 130.02 133.51 <NA> <unk> questions as possible started to come to our minds
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 133.23 142.63 <NA> and that has been really a tough time questions some basics like you know why did this happen to us and what went wrong
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 142.26 143.93 <NA> some more
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 143.93 153.52 <NA> tough like really what will be the impact on mario 's life i mean at the end will he be able to work will he be able to be normal and you know as a parent especially for the first time
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 153.57 154.97 <NA> why is he not going
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 154.93 157.07 <NA> <unk> to be better than us
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 156.76 163.35 <NA> and this indeed really is tough to say but a few months later we realized that
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 163.11 169.58 <NA> we were really feeling like a failure i mean the the only real product of our life
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 169.58 174.84 <NA> at the end was a failure and you know it was not a failure for ourselves
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 177.53 180.81 <NA> <unk> was a failure that will impact his full life
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 181.85 187.42 <NA> honestly we went down i mean we went really down but at the end
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 187.21 191.32 <NA> we started to look at him and we said we have to react
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 191.32 197.95 <NA> so immediately as francesca said we changed our life we started physiotherapy we started the rehabilitation
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 197.76 204.94 <NA> and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot basically we spent months
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 205.07 208.01 <NA> doing this with mario you have an object
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 207.77 211.4 <NA> and we showed him how to grab the object
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 211.19 218.27 <NA> now the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains exactly now as you watch me doing this
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 218.27 222.7 <NA> you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 222.24 224.17 <NA> the actions
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 223.86 229.64 <NA> it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation but one day
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 230.32 234.86 <NA> <unk> we found that mario was not looking at our hand
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 235.12 237.5 <NA> he was looking at us
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 237.4 239.87 <NA> we were his mirror
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 239.87 247.37 <NA> and the problem as you might feel is that we were down we were depressed we we were looking at him as a problem
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 247.09 254.64 <NA> not as a son not from a positive perspective and that day really changed our perspective
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 254.9 256.9 <NA> <unk> we realized that we
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 256.72 267 <NA> had to become a better mirror for mario we restarted from our strengths and at the same time we restarted from his strengths we stopped <unk>
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 266.95 273.21 <NA> looking at him as a problem and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 279.9 288.84 <NA> <unk> our strengths that we really can bring to mario and we started from our passions i mean at the end my wife and myself are quite different but we have many things in common
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 288.62 295.15 <NA> we love to travel we love music we love to be in places like this and we started to bring mario with us
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 295.15 299.38 <NA> just to show to him the best things that we can show to him
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 299.7 303.02 <NA> this short video is from last week
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 305.29 306.8 <NA> <unk> i am not saying applause
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 308.02 317.41 <NA> i am not saying it 's a miracle that 's not the message because we are just at the beginning of the path but we want to share what was the key learning
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 317.41 323.91 <NA> the key learning that mario drove to us and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 323.72 325.11 <NA> only what
RobertoDAngelo_2013G 1 RobertoDAngelo_2013G 327.26 336.81 <NA> <unk> and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity and this is the message that we want to share with you this is why we are here
