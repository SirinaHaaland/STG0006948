RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 416.5 420.42 <NA> we saw these alternations between sediments that look like this

RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 452.08 457.62 <NA> <unk> between gravels and these plant sediments so what that means is what it tells us
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 457.41 468.92 <NA> is that the ross sea region this ice shelf melted back and formed anew about thirty five times and this is in the past four million years

RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 485.48 499.78 <NA> <unk> and formed again and sea level went up and down six meters at a time what caused it well we 're pretty sure that it 's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching antarctica just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the earth but here 's the key thing
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 500.85 512.08 <NA> <unk> the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold that the planet warmed up enough and the number 's about one degree to one and a half degrees centigrade the planet warmed up enough that it became 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 512.08 521.77 <NA> that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted and you know what we 've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 521.4 525.11 <NA> so many of us are convinced now that west
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 525.58 536.73 <NA> <unk> the west antarctic ice sheet is starting to melt we do expect to see a sea level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century and it could be larger than that 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 536.73 542.61 <NA> this is a serious consequence for nations like kiribati you know where the average elevation is about

RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 578.29 579.91 <NA> so one of the things thought of in the
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 580.1 588.73 <NA> 80s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event and just so you know <unk>
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 590.12 596.41 <NA> that el nino killed ninety five percent of all the corals here in galapagos then there was similar mortality <unk>
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 597.59 604.97 <NA> and what we found after drilling back in time two to four hundred years was that these were unique events we saw no

RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 609.66 615.57 <NA> so they 're either just truly monster el ninos or they 're just very strong el ninos that occurred

RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 633.94 642.64 <NA> now sylvia earle turned me on to this exact same coral and she was diving here with john lauret i think it was one thousand nine hundred and ninety four and collected a little nugget and sent it to me <unk> 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 642.64 648.94 <NA> and we started working on it and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this

RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 879.96 883.18 <NA> <unk> 's truly different <unk> so
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 883.02 887.74 <NA> i 'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 887.58 897.4 <NA> i like it as a component of global change to talk about because even if you are a hard bitten global warming skeptic and i talk to that community fairly often 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 897.4 899.9 <NA> you cannot deny the simple
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 905.05 914.18 <NA> <unk> pumping out lots of co2 into the atmosphere from fossil fuels from cement production right now about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea right
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 914.05 918.71 <NA> and as it does so it makes the ocean more acidic 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 918.49 927.47 <NA> so you cannot argue with that that is what 's happening right now <unk> and it 's a very different issue than the global warming issue 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 927.19 929.31 <NA> it has many consequences
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 930.35 932.37 <NA> <unk> for carbonate organisms 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 931.97 943.2 <NA> there are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate plants and animals both the main framework material of coral reefs is is calcium carbonate 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 942.71 946.38 <NA> that material is more soluble in
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 945.95 954.97 <NA> acidic fluid <unk> so one of the things we 're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 955.08 961.13 <NA> <unk> their shells at some point as this transience as this co2 uptake in the ocean continues 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 961.13 968.5 <NA> that material 's actually going to start to dissolve and on coral reefs where some of the main framework organisms disappear <unk> 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 968.04 972.43 <NA> we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity <unk> 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 972 975.32 <NA> but it 's not just the carbonate producers that are affected
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 975.76 987.35 <NA> <unk> there 's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean so many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean so 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 987.07 988.94 <NA> all of these things
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 988.63 991.34 <NA> greater metabolic demands <unk> 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 990.88 999.6 <NA> reduced reproductive success changes in respiration and metabolism you know these are things that we have good physiological reasons to
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1000 1003.42 <NA> <unk> to see stressed caused by this transience so
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1003.21 1013.43 <NA> we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co2 levels in the atmosphere going back millions of years we used to do it just with ice cores but in this case we 're going back <unk>
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1013.38 1018.72 <NA> twenty million years <unk> and we take samples of the sediment and it tells us the co2 level
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1025 1027.63 <NA> fifteen million years to find
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1027.43 1037.32 <NA> a time when co2 levels were about what they are today <unk> you have to go back about thirty million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today now
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1037.12 1043.74 <NA> what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1043.74 1051.88 <NA> with co2 levels lower than they are today <unk> that 's the reason that they 're not able to respond or adapt to this
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1051.67 1054.7 <NA> rapid acidification that 's going on right now
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1054.9 1057.85 <NA> so charlie veron came up with this
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1057.65 1068.39 <NA> statement last year the prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic co2 release 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1068.39 1073.45 <NA> and i think that may very well be true <unk> so i 'll close with this you know 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1073.08 1082.84 <NA> we do need the protected areas absolutely but for the sake of the oceans we have to cap or limit co2 emissions as soon as possible <unk> 
RobDunbar_2010Z 1 RobDunbar_2010Z 1082.47 1083.93 <NA> thank you very much
