MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 218.58 224.48 <NA> so the physicists have been working on fusion for a while and one of the ways they do it is with

MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 280.17 289.79 <NA> now most people think that fusion is going nowhere <unk> they always think that the physicists are in their lab and they 're working hard but nothing is happening that 's actually not quite true 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 289.79 300.11 <NA> this is a curve of the gain in fusion over the last thirty years or so and you can see that we 're making now about ten thousand times more fusion than we used to when we started <unk> that 's a pretty good gain

MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 331.46 342.12 <NA> is the nif it 's the national ignition facility <unk> it 's a big laser machine in the u s and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion <unk>
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 342.02 350.05 <NA> <unk> energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in the center of the ping pong ball now that 's not quite good enough because the laser to put that

MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 364.62 376.57 <NA> and this machine when it 's finished will produce five hundred megawatts of fusion power with only fifty megawatts to make it so this one is the real one it 's going to work <unk> that 's the kind of machine that makes energy 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 376.11 379.88 <NA> now if you look at the graph you will notice that those two dots are a little bit on the
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 379.81 387.5 <NA> <unk> right of the curve we kind of have fallen off the progress actually the science to make those machines was really in time to produce
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 387.07 397.61 <NA> fusion during that curve <unk> however there has been a bit of politics going on and the will to do it was not there <unk> so it drifted to the right iter for example could have been built <unk>
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 397.51 404.67 <NA> <unk> in two thousand or two thousand and five but because it 's a big international collaboration the politics got in and it delayed it a bit for example
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 404.96 407.64 <NA> <unk> them about three years to decide where to put it <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 407.42 417.39 <NA> now <unk> fusion is often criticized for being a little too expensive <unk> yes it did cost a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year to make this progress <unk> but you have to compare <unk>
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 417.29 424.9 <NA> <unk> that to the cost of making moore 's law that cost way more than that the result of moore 's law is this cell phone here in my pocket 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 429.96 438.22 <NA> <unk> i can take a selfie and put it on facebook then when my dad sees that he 'll be very proud
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 439.5 447.94 <NA> we also spend about six hundred and fifty billion dollars a year in subsidies for oil and gas and renewable energy 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 447.94 452.02 <NA> now we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 451.56 454.82 <NA> so me <unk> personally i don 't think it 's too expensive
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 454.87 457.89 <NA> <unk> think it 's actually been shortchanged considering it can solve all <unk>
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 457.68 461.73 <NA> <unk> our energy problems cleanly for the next couple of billions of years 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 461.73 469.58 <NA> now i can say that but i 'm a little bit biased <unk> because i started a fusion company and i don 't even have a facebook account 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 469.9 475.08 <NA> so when i started this fusion company in two thousand and two i knew
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 475.04 482.47 <NA> <unk> i couldn 't fight with the big lads they had much more resources than me <unk> so i decided i would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 482.26 490.62 <NA> now magnetic and laser fusion are pretty good machines they are awesome pieces of technology <unk> wonderful machines and they have shown that fusion can be done <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 490.62 500.08 <NA> however <unk> as a power plant i don 't think they 're very good they 're way too big way too complicated way too expensive <unk> and also they don 't deal very much with the fusion
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 500.85 508.52 <NA> <unk> when you make fusion the energy comes out as neutrons fast neutrons comes out of the plasma those neutrons hit the wall of the machine <unk> it damages it 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 508.52 517.03 <NA> and also you have to catch the heat from those neutrons and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere and on those machines it was all a bit of an afterthought <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 516.69 523.39 <NA> so i decided that surely there is a better way of doing that so back to the literature and i read about the fusion everywhere 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 523.39 529.64 <NA> one way in particular attracted my attention and it 's called magnetized target fusion or mtf for short
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 530.77 533.48 <NA> now in mtf what you want to do
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 533.25 537.18 <NA> is you take a big vat and you fill that with liquid metal
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 537 544.07 <NA> and you spin the liquid metal to open a vortex in the center <unk> a bit like your sink when you pull the plug on a sink it makes a vortex 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 543.58 554.76 <NA> and then you have some pistons driven by pressure that goes on the outside <unk> and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma and it compresses it it gets hotter like a laser and then it makes fusion so it 's a bit of a
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 555.02 558.84 <NA> <unk> between a magnetized fusion and the laser fusion 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 558.35 567.5 <NA> so those have a couple of very good advantages the liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall and therefore there 's no damage to the machine 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 567.5 574.93 <NA> the liquid metal gets hot <unk> so you can pump that in a heat exchanger make some steam spin a turbine <unk> so that 's a very convenient way of doing this part of the
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 577.56 579.76 <NA> <unk> all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from <unk>
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 581.15 589.36 <NA> which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils now this was all very good except for the problem that it didn 't quite work there
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 590.28 591.83 <NA> 's always a catch <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 591.62 602.3 <NA> so when you compress that the plasma cools down faster than the compression speed <unk> so you 're trying to compress it but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 602.3 603.44 <NA> so when i saw that
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 604.96 608.59 <NA> <unk> it 's a very very good idea so hopefully i can improve on that <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 608.6 622.68 <NA> so i thought about it for a minute and i said okay how can we make that work better <unk> so then i thought about impact <unk> what about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in that won 't work <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 622.5 629.91 <NA> so what the idea is is to use the idea of an impact <unk> so we accelerate the pistons with steam that takes a little bit of time but then
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 629.84 637.38 <NA> <unk> bang you hit the piston and baff all the energy is done instantly down instantly to the liquid and that compresses the plasma much faster <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 637.38 642.36 <NA> so i decided okay this is good let 's make that <unk> so we built this machine
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 642.35 649.87 <NA> in this garage here we made a small machine that we managed to squeeze a little bit of neutrons out of that and those are my marketing
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 650.85 654.7 <NA> <unk> and with those marketing neutrons then i raised about fifty million dollars 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 654.3 663.93 <NA> and i hired sixty five people that 's my team here <unk> and this is what we want to build <unk> so it 's going to be a big machine about three meters in diameter liquid lead spinning around 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 663.94 674.99 <NA> big vortex in the center put the plasma on the top and on the bottom piston hits on the side <unk> bang it compresses it <unk> and it will make some energy and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal going to go in a
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 675 684.59 <NA> steam engine and make the turbine <unk> and some of the steam will go back to fire the piston we 're going to run that about one time per second <unk> and it will produce one hundred megawatts of electricity <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 686.29 694.49 <NA> okay we also built this injector so this injector makes the plasma to start with it makes the plasma at about a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees <unk>
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 697.6 704.46 <NA> <unk> last quite long enough <unk> so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit but last month it got a lot better so i think we have the plasma
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 704.93 710.04 <NA> <unk> compressing now then we built a small sphere about this big fourteen pistons around it <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 709.81 717.79 <NA> and this will compress the liquid however plasma is difficult to compress when you compress it it tends to go a little bit crooked like that <unk> 
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 717.79 721.87 <NA> so you need the timing of the piston to be very good and for that we use
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 721.68 724.54 <NA> several control systems <unk> which was not possible in
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 730.02 740.14 <NA> <unk> so finally <unk> most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen <unk> but as a matter of fact fusion is getting very close <unk> we are almost there the big labs have shown that <unk>
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 740.04 749.84 <NA> <unk> fusion is doable and now there are small companies that are thinking about that and they say it 's not that it cannot be done but it 's how to make it cost effectively general fusion is one of those small
MichelLaberge_2014 1 MichelLaberge_2014 753.85 757.62 <NA> <unk> will crack that nut and perhaps it will be general fusion <unk> thank you very much
