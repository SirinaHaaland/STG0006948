CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 357.69 361 <NA> different types of things as you can see here
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 361 367.51 <NA> things they would throw away anyway then we put a little chip little tag onto the trash
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 367.35 372.02 <NA> and then started following it here are the results we just obtained
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 410.33 416.81 <NA> <unk> this information we realized there 's a lot of inefficiencies in the system <unk> we can actually do the same thing with much less energy

CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 440.06 454.91 <NA> assaf biderman he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning <unk> and that 's actuating our environment and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 455.6 466.56 <NA> it started with a question by the mayor of the city who came to us saying that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space <unk> in architecture 
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 466.38 475.95 <NA> and the question was how could technology new technology be added to that and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a workshop was imagine this pipe and you 've got

CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 492.34 495.69 <NA> jump through as you see in this image 
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 495.38 503.01 <NA> well we presented this to mayor belloch he liked it very much and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo

CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 534.34 539.06 <NA> and if there 's a bit of wind if you want to minimize splashing you can actually lower the roof or
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 540.58 542.24 <NA> you could
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 542.29 552.12 <NA> close the building <unk> and the whole architecture will disappear like in this case you know these days you always get images during the winter when they take the roof down of people who have been there
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 554.99 558.03 <NA> <unk> it just when it goes down the architecture almost
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 557.83 564.16 <NA> disappears <unk> here 's the building working you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside and
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 564.16 569.29 <NA> here was myself trying not to get wet <unk> testing the sensors that open the water <unk> 
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 569.05 573.84 <NA> well <unk> i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 574.1 575.14 <NA> <unk> but actually
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 576.93 585.19 <NA> <unk> more fun all the kids from zaragoza came to the building because the way of engaging with the building became something different not anymore a building that would open up to let you in 
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 585.19 590.24 <NA> but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water and you had to jump without getting
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 604.81 614.99 <NA> <unk> very interesting because as architects as engineers <unk> as designers we always think about how people will use the things we design <unk> but then reality 's always unpredictable and that 's the beauty of <unk>
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 614.94 629.01 <NA> of doing things that are used and interact with people here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels the pixels made of water <unk> and then projections on them and this is what led us to think about the following project i 'll show you now 
CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 630.05 640.44 <NA> <unk> pixels could actually start flying imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air <unk> and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights almost <unk>

CarloRatti_2011 1 CarloRatti_2011 743.04 751.82 <NA> <unk> by people <unk> you can have each pixel having an input that comes from people from people 's movement or so and so i want to show you something here for the first time <unk>
