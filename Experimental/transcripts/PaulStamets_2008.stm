PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 918.25 929.73 <NA> and then you put tree seeds in here <unk> and then you end up growing potentially an old growth forest from a cardboard box i want to reinvent the delivery system <unk> and the use of
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 929.69 935.19 <NA> <unk> cardboard around the world so they become ecological footprints if there 's a youtube like
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 934.88 949.5 <NA> site that you could put up you could make it interactive zip code specific where people could join together <unk> and through satellite imaging systems through virtual earth or google earth you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through life boxes 
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 949.16 954.22 <NA> you could take a cardboard box delivering shoes <unk> you could add water i developed this for
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 954.96 962.56 <NA> <unk> refugee community corns beans and squash and onions i took several containers my wife said if i could do this anybody could
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 962.34 967.15 <NA> and i ended up growing a seed garden then you harvest the seeds
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 966.69 970.63 <NA> and thank you eric rasmussen <unk> for your help on this
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 970.62 979.97 <NA> and then you 're harvesting the seed garden then you can harvest the kernels <unk> and then you just need a few kernels i add mycelium to it <unk> and then i inoculate the corncobs
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 980.22 988.37 <NA> <unk> now three corncobs <unk> no other grain lots of mushrooms begin to form <unk> too many withdrawals from the carbon bank <unk> 
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 988.18 992.09 <NA> and so this population will be shut down but watch what happens here 
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 994.63 997.43 <NA> the mushrooms then are harvested <unk> but
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 997.43 1004.97 <NA> very importantly the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars <unk> and so i thought
PaulStamets_2008 1 PaulStamets_2008 1005.13 1013.05 <NA> how could we address the energy crisis in this country <unk> and we came up with econol
