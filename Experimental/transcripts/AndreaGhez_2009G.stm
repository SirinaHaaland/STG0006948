AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 20.18 27.51 <NA> because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it not even light so you
AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 27.28 28.98 <NA> can 't see it directly
AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 30.05 43.5 <NA> <unk> story today about black holes is about one particular black hole <unk> i 'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy <unk> 
AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 43.13 46 <NA> and the reason this is interesting is that
AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 45.82 48.03 <NA> it gives us an opportunity to
AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 47.63 54.97 <NA> prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist and second it gives us the opportunity

AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 60.37 65.95 <NA> and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in 
AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 66.09 75.17 <NA> so to begin with we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole <unk> so what is a black hole <unk> 
AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 75.17 79.25 <NA> well in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object because

AndreaGhez_2009G 1 AndreaGhez_2009G 139.15 145.48 <NA> it 's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole
