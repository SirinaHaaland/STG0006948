CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 16.15 25.08 <NA> 's a diagram of the visual system <unk> and some things look very familiar today <unk> two eyes at the bottom <unk> optic nerve flowing out from the back
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 25.85 30.36 <NA> <unk> 's a very large nose that doesn 't seem to be connected to anything in particular <unk> 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 30.5 44.32 <NA> and if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system you 'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years <unk> and that 's because today we can see what 's inside of the brain rather than just looking at its overall shape <unk> 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 44.32 48.43 <NA> imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 48.24 50.14 <NA> and all you could see was a keyboard
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 50.19 51.95 <NA> <unk> a mouse a screen 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 51.74 61.81 <NA> you really would be kind of out of luck you want to be able to open it up crack it open look at the wiring inside and up until a little more than a century ago <unk> nobody was able to do that with <unk>
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 61.71 76.28 <NA> <unk> the brain nobody had had a glimpse of the brain 's wiring and that 's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it put it under even a very powerful microscope there 's nothing there it 's gray <unk> formless there 's no structure it won 't tell you anything 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 80.02 87.9 <NA> <unk> new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring the computer was cracked open 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 87.66 97.83 <NA> so what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the golgi stain and it works in a very particular way instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 97.83 104.97 <NA> it somehow only stains about one percent of them it clears the forest reveals the trees inside if everything had been labeled
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 105.13 118.14 <NA> nothing would have been visible so somehow it shows what 's there <unk> spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramon y cajal who 's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience applied this golgi stain which yields data which looks like this
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 117.65 126.81 <NA> <unk> and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell the neuron and if you 're thinking of the brain as a computer this is the transistor <unk> 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 126.59 129.97 <NA> and very quickly cajal realized that neurons don 't operate
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 130.04 135.16 <NA> alone but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 134.94 146.56 <NA> today a century later when researchers want to visualize neurons they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them <unk> and there 's several ways of doing this but one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein <unk> 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 146.25 150.38 <NA> now green fluorescent protein which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 151.27 158.55 <NA> <unk> is very useful because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell that cell will glow green
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 158.37 168.65 <NA> or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein you get a cell to glow many different colors <unk> and so coming back to the brain this is from a genetically engineered mouse called <unk>
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 168.6 174.29 <NA> brainbow and it 's so called of course because all of these neurons are are glowing different colors <unk> 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 179.93 182.73 <NA> <unk> of neurons molecules rather than the entire cell 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 182.53 192.81 <NA> and there 's several ways of doing this but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies and you 're familiar of course with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system <unk> but it <unk>
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 192.71 202.21 <NA> <unk> turns out that they 're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules like for example the coat protein of a virus that 's invading the body <unk> 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 205.28 212.94 <NA> recognize specific molecules inside of the brain recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually 
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 212.95 225.05 <NA> and a lot of the images i 've been showing you here are very beautiful but they 're also very powerful they have great explanatory power this for example is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 225.28 235.4 <NA> <unk> and you 've heard of serotonin of course in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety you 've heard of ssris which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases <unk> and in order <unk>
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 235.3 244.53 <NA> <unk> to understand how serotonin works it 's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is and antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question
CarlSchoonover_2012U 1 CarlSchoonover_2012U 280.44 281.69 <NA> <unk> tissue were developed and
