MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 71.73 79.85 <NA> so obviously there 's a massive housing gap <unk> and this really upset me <unk> because academia tells you after a major disaster there 's

MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 96.94 99.03 <NA> so i became obsessed
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 98.87 104.97 <NA> with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap this actually became my creative obsession
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 105.25 112.77 <NA> <unk> i put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem <unk> 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 113.36 119.62 <NA> so i started sketching two days after katrina i started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this and
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 119.62 124.77 <NA> as things started to congeal or ideas started to form i started sketching digitally on the computer <unk> 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 124.4 129.76 <NA> but it was an obsession <unk> so i couldn 't just stop there <unk> i started experimenting making models
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 130.05 132.1 <NA> <unk> talking to experts in the field taking their
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 131.9 141.76 <NA> feedback and refining and i kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years now my obsession ended up driving me to create
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 141.78 150.07 <NA> full size prototypes in my own backyard and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 149.58 154.97 <NA> a variety of other costs <unk> but in the end i ended up with this modular housing system that can
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 154.93 162.38 <NA> <unk> react to any situation or disaster it can be put up in any environment from an asphalt parking lot
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 162.15 168.17 <NA> to pastures or fields <unk> because it doesn 't require any special setup or specialty tools 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 167.98 179.97 <NA> now at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the exo housing unit <unk> which is just the individual shelter module and though it 's light light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around <unk> and it actually sleeps
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 179.96 181.26 <NA> <unk> four people 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 182.75 193.35 <NA> and you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout or you can circle the wagons essentially and form these circular pods out of them <unk> which give you this <unk>
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 194.27 199.17 <NA> <unk> communal area for people to actually spill out into so they 're not actually trapped inside these units 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 199.94 204.97 <NA> now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters because gone
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 205.08 214 <NA> <unk> are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium where people are crammed on these cots inside now we have instant neighborhoods outside <unk> 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 216.18 222.61 <NA> so the exo is designed to be simply <unk> basically like a coffee cup they can actually stack together
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 222.61 225.23 <NA> so we get extremely efficient transportation
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 225.91 229.94 <NA> <unk> and storage out of them in fact fifteen exos can fit on a
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 229.48 237.83 <NA> single semi truck by itself this means the exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today <unk> 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 239.74 250.37 <NA> but i 'm obsessive so i couldn 't just stop there so i actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 250.45 254.85 <NA> the doors can actually swap out so you can actually put on a

MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 288.03 294.55 <NA> but i was quickly told that boy our government doesn 't really work like that okay okay 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 294.42 299.93 <NA> so maybe i would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 302.02 303.32 <NA> <unk> our government looks
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 303.15 305.75 <NA> to private sector for things like this 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 305.77 315.03 <NA> okay <unk> so maybe i would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it <unk> but i was quickly told by some corporations
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 314.87 318.98 <NA> that my personal passion project was not a brand fit
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 319.33 325.17 <NA> because they didn 't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of haiti <unk> now i wasn 't just

MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 343.85 353.53 <NA> so i was like what will i do <unk> so i actually scheduled sleep on my calendar and spent the 8 hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers manufacturers and potential customers
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 354.96 358.73 <NA> <unk> and we found through this whole process we found this great little manufacturer in virginia <unk> 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 358.73 366.07 <NA> and if his body language is any indication that 's the owner of what it 's like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer you 've got to
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 365.7 374.53 <NA> see what happens here but g s industries was fantastic they actually built three prototypes for us by hand 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 375.4 382.79 <NA> <unk> so now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide <unk> 
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 1 MichaelMcDaniel_2012X 384.58 391.43 <NA> and they actually shipped them here to texas for us now a funny thing started happening other people started to believe in what we were doing and actually offered us
