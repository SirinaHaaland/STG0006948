LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 13.3 22.91 <NA> <unk> organic chemists make molecules <unk> very complicated molecules <unk> by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 22.78 29.97 <NA> and as a chemist one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is could we make a really cool universal
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 30.46 35.52 <NA> chemistry set in essence could we app chemistry <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 36.2 39.39 <NA> now what would this mean and how would we do it <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 39.62 48.25 <NA> well to start to do this we took a 3d printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 48.04 54.64 <NA> and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 54.99 64.54 <NA> <unk> and so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time <unk> we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 64.17 67.9 <NA> now what could this mean <unk> well if we can embed
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 67.44 79.67 <NA> biological and chemical networks like a search engine so if you have a a cell that 's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill if you have this embedded in your device at the same time
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 79.96 84.29 <NA> <unk> do the chemistry you may be able to make drugs in a new way <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 85 94.85 <NA> so how are we doing this in the lab <unk> well it requires software it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks <unk> and so the really cool bit is the idea is <unk>
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 94.75 104.7 <NA> <unk> that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer and you download the blueprint the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 104.87 112.29 <NA> <unk> in the device <unk> and so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 112.34 118.41 <NA> so what could this mean <unk> well <unk> ultimately it could mean that you could print your own medicine <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 118.73 129.97 <NA> and this is what we 're doing in the lab at the moment but to take baby steps to get there <unk> first of all we want to look at drug design and production or drug discovery and manufacturing <unk> because if we can manufacture
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 130.05 135.85 <NA> <unk> it after we 've discovered it we could deploy it anywhere you don 't need to go to the chemist anymore 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 135.87 138.85 <NA> we can print drugs at point of need 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 138.51 147.58 <NA> we can download new diagnostics say a new super bug has emerged you put it in your search engine <unk> and you create the drug to treat the threat <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 147.51 149.84 <NA> so this allows you on the fly
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 151.57 162.6 <NA> <unk> but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells with your genes and your environment and you print your own personal medicine <unk> 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 162.6 168.41 <NA> and if that doesn 't seem fanciful enough <unk> where do you think we 're going to go <unk> well 
LeeCronin_2012G 1 LeeCronin_2012G 167.92 172.89 <NA> you 're going to have your own personal matter fabricator <unk> beam me up scotty
