CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 155.32 168.71 <NA> <unk> i love that moment in this video because before it became a shared experience it was something that was maybe a little bit scary or something that was at least confusing to her <unk> and then once it became a shared experience it was funny and something that she could laugh at 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 168.4 171.39 <NA> so the train is now pulling into the third stop
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 190.19 202.59 <NA> <unk> so the video won 't show everything this goes on for another four stops a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear at the eighth stop a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar

CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 305.95 315.11 <NA> so this project is called look up more <unk> we had seventy actors dress in black this was completely unauthorized we didn 't let the stores know we were coming <unk> and i stood in the park giving signals <unk>
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 315.06 320.72 <NA> the first signal was for everybody to hold up these four foot tall letters that spelled out look up more

CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 373.17 380 <NA> there 's a better photo of it so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened

CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 380.97 385.59 <NA> the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 385.59 395.37 <NA> a high school kid in texas wrote me in two thousand and six and said you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around

CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 433.39 439.96 <NA> now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt everybody else is one of our actors 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 441.06 453.4 <NA> the lower level employees thought it was very funny and in fact <unk> several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 454.72 459.14 <NA> <unk> managers and the security guards on the other hand did not find it particularly funny <unk> 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 459.14 468.23 <NA> you can see them in this footage they 're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt and we were there probably ten minutes before the managers decided to dial nine hundred and eleven 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 469.69 474.96 <NA> so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming watch out the cops were
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 476.06 486.21 <NA> <unk> you can see the cops in this footage right here that 's a cop wearing black right there being filmed with a hidden camera <unk> ultimately the police had to inform best buy management that it was not in fact illegal to wear a blue polo <unk>
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 496.58 500.08 <NA> so we had been there for twenty minutes
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 500 505.39 <NA> we were happy to exit the store one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 504.93 508.58 <NA> and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags <unk> 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 508.58 516.34 <NA> but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 519.06 522.91 <NA> so i like that concept of using their own technology against them 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 523.95 529.97 <NA> i think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason <unk> and one morning
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 529.96 542.27 <NA> <unk> i was riding the subway i had to make a transfer at the 53rd st stop where there are these two giant escalators and it 's a very depressing place to be in the morning it 's very crowded <unk> so i decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 543.82 549.81 <NA> <unk> so this was in the winter of two thousand and nine eight thirty in the morning it 's morning rush hour it 's very
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 551.24 560.2 <NA> <unk> people are coming in from queens transferring from the e train to the six train and they 're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 593.37 600.05 <NA> <unk> a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better he gave two thousand high fives that day <unk> and he washed his hands
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 600 601.89 <NA> before and afterward and
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 601.68 606.77 <NA> did not get sick and that was done also without permission <unk> although no one seemed to care
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 606.77 616.07 <NA> <unk> so i 'd say over the years one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is these people have too much time on their hands 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 616.18 629.97 <NA> and you know not everybody 's going to like everything you do and i 've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments but that one 's always bothered me because we don 't have too much time on our hands <unk> the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 629.93 634.68 <NA> <unk> new yorkers they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way you know
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 634.48 646.77 <NA> every saturday and sunday hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games and i 've never seen anybody comment <unk> looking at a football game saying all those people in the stands they have too much time on their hands 
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 646.77 649.96 <NA> and of course they don 't it 's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a

CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 653.35 661.9 <NA> but i think it 's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with two hundred people in the grand central terminal or
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 661.47 664.15 <NA> dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library

CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 682.09 691.85 <NA> as kids we 're taught to play and we 're never given a reason why we should play it 's just acceptable that play is a good thing <unk> and i think that 's sort of the point of improv everywhere it 's that <unk>
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 691.75 704.79 <NA> <unk> there is no point and that there doesn 't have to be a point we don 't need a reason as long as it 's fun and it seems like it 's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time then that 's enough for us and
CharlieTodd_2011X 1 CharlieTodd_2011X 704.87 709.57 <NA> <unk> think as adults we need to learn that there 's no right or wrong way to play <unk> thank you very much
