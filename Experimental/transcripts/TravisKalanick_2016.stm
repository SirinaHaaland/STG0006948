TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 63 70.41 <NA> so let me introduce you to the jitney in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen it was created or invented
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 70.41 75.05 <NA> by a guy named lp draper <unk> he was a car salesman from la and he had

TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 104.15 110.74 <NA> <unk> there were fifty thousand rides per day in seattle forty five thousand rides per day in kansas

TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 119.27 125.16 <NA> is doing one hundred and fifty seven thousand rides per day today

TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 137.97 140.41 <NA> and so they got to work
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 139.95 142.9 <NA> and they went to cities across the country
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 142.67 148.09 <NA> and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 148.02 154.61 <NA> and there were all kinds of regulations there were licenses often they were pricey <unk> in some cities

TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 165.25 168.84 <NA> but there was a really interesting regulation which was
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 168.68 171.26 <NA> they had to put a backseat light
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 171.43 177.39 <NA> install it in every jitney to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 179.9 184.15 <NA> <unk> so what happened <unk> well within a year this thing had taken off <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 184.15 190.71 <NA> but the jitney by one thousand nine hundred and nineteen was regulated completely out of existence <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 190.4 192.27 <NA> that 's unfortunate 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 192.71 201.34 <NA> because well when you can 't share a car then you have to own one <unk> and car ownership skyrocketed and it 's no wonder
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 201.15 204.97 <NA> that by two thousand and seven there was a car for every man
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 205.02 213.19 <NA> <unk> woman and child in the united states and that phenomenon had gone global in china by two thousand and eleven 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 213 217.09 <NA> there were more car sales happening in china than in the us 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 216.93 224.93 <NA> now all this private ownership of course had a public cost in the us we spend seven billion hours
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 226.87 228.5 <NA> <unk> sitting in traffic 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 228.37 237.74 <NA> one hundred and sixty billion dollars in lost productivity of course also sitting in traffic and one fifth of all of our carbon footprint
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 237.52 241.43 <NA> is spewed out in the air by those cars that we 're sitting in now 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 241.9 249.87 <NA> that 's only four percent of our problem though <unk> because if you have to own a car then that means ninety six percent of the time your car is
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 251.3 255.6 <NA> <unk> and so up to thirty percent of our land and our space
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 255.11 258.87 <NA> is used storing these hunks of steel <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 258.38 266.1 <NA> we even have skyscrapers built for cars that 's the world we live in today <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 267.23 275.23 <NA> now cities have been dealing with this problem for decades it 's called mass transit and even in a city like new york city
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 275.55 281.36 <NA> <unk> one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 281.36 287.11 <NA> there are still two point five million cars that go over those bridges
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 286.62 294.94 <NA> every day <unk> why is that well it 's because mass transit hasn 't yet figured out
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 294.81 304.36 <NA> how to get to everybody 's doorstep <unk> and so back in san francisco where i live the situation 's much worse in fact much worse
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 304.9 314.03 <NA> <unk> world <unk> and so the beginning of uber in two thousand and ten was well we just wanted to push a button and get a ride we didn 't have any grand ambitions 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 313.75 323.66 <NA> but it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride <unk> and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 323.83 328.08 <NA> we saw a lot of people pushing the same button
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 327.84 329.88 <NA> at the same time going
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 329.89 337.38 <NA> essentially to the same place <unk> and so we started thinking about well how do we make those two trips and turn them into one 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 337.31 340.3 <NA> because if we did that ride would
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 340.14 343.05 <NA> be a lot cheaper up to fifty percent cheaper
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 342.65 349.93 <NA> and of course for the city you 've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars <unk> and so the big question for us was 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 351.15 354.55 <NA> <unk> could you have a cheaper ride
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 354.09 358.03 <NA> cheap enough that people would be willing to share it 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 357.9 365.83 <NA> and the answer fortunately is a resounding yes <unk> in san francisco <unk> before uberpool 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 365.49 369.46 <NA> we had well everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 369.36 374.99 <NA> and the bright colors is where we have the most cars and once we introduced uberpool 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 375.13 377.75 <NA> <unk> you see there 's not as many bright colors 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 377.89 386.57 <NA> more people getting around the city in fewer cars <unk> taking cars off the road <unk> it looks like uberpool is working <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 386.77 390.02 <NA> and so we rolled it out in los angeles
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 390.16 398.03 <NA> eight months ago and since then we 've taken seven point nine million miles off the roads
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 397.63 404.52 <NA> and we 've taken one point four thousand metric tons of co2 out of the air
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 405.35 407.22 <NA> <unk> but the part that i 'm really 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 411.08 413.94 <NA> but my favorite statistic
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 413.51 421.71 <NA> remember i 'm from la i spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel going how do we fix this my favorite part
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 421.28 429.61 <NA> is that eight months later we have added one hundred thousand new people that are carpooling every week
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 430.14 433.42 <NA> <unk> now in china everything is supersized <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 433.23 445.15 <NA> and so we 're doing fifteen million uberpool trips per month that 's five hundred thousand per day and of course we 're seeing that exponential growth happen in fact we 're seeing it in la too 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 444.78 449.36 <NA> and when i talk to my team we don 't talk about hey well one hundred thousand
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 455.02 456.17 <NA> <unk> to a million and
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 456.19 459.35 <NA> in china <unk> well <unk> that could be several million <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 459.31 467.78 <NA> and so uberpool is a very great solution for urban carpooling <unk> but what about the suburbs 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 467.41 475.08 <NA> this is the street where i grew up in los angeles it 's actually a suburb called northridge california and well look
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 475.07 481.41 <NA> <unk> those mailboxes they kind of just go on forever <unk> and every morning at about the same time 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 481.34 486.84 <NA> cars roll of out their driveway most of them one person in the car 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 487.49 494.58 <NA> and they go to work they go to their place of work so the question for us is well how do we turn
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 494.84 504.16 <NA> all of these commuter cars and literally there 's tens of millions of them how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 504.96 509.8 <NA> <unk> well <unk> we have something for this that we recently launched called ubercommute you
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 509.49 513.88 <NA> get up in the morning get ready for work get your coffee go to your car
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 513.39 519.52 <NA> and you light up the uber app and all of a sudden you become an uber driver <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 519.87 524.08 <NA> and we 'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 524.19 529.28 <NA> and it 's a really great thing there 's just one hitch
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 530.05 538.1 <NA> <unk> it 's called regulation so fifty four cents a mile what is that <unk> well <unk> that is what the us government has determined
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 537.67 541.31 <NA> that the cost of owning a car is per mile 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 541.21 550.56 <NA> you can pick up anybody in the united states and take them wherever they want to go at a moment 's notice for fifty four cents a mile or less <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 550.56 552.96 <NA> but if you charge sixty cents a mile
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 554.87 560.07 <NA> <unk> but what if for sixty cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 559.7 563.16 <NA> in los angeles <unk> and what if
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 562.67 572.58 <NA> at sixty cents a mile we could get fifty million people carpooling in the united states if we could it 's obviously something we should do <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 572.63 574.99 <NA> and so it goes back to the lesson of the
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 577.35 585.64 <NA> <unk> fifteen this thing was taking off <unk> imagine without the regulations that happened if that thing could just keep going
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 585.66 592.55 <NA> how would our cities be different today would we have parks in the place of parking lots 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 592.55 597.71 <NA> well we lost that chance but technology has given us another opportunity <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 597.52 600.17 <NA> now <unk> i 'm as excited as anybody
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 602.89 608.72 <NA> <unk> but do we have to really wait five ten or even twenty years to make
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 608.44 616.64 <NA> our new cities a reality with the technology in our pockets today <unk> and a little smart regulation 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 616.39 620.84 <NA> we can turn every car into a shared car 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 620.86 623.91 <NA> and we can reclaim our cities

TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 888.84 894.85 <NA> forced to be whether you want it or not a kind of global visionary who 's 's changing the world i mean
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 894.6 899.99 <NA> who are you do you want that are you ready to go with that and and be what
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 901.24 904.28 <NA> <unk> there 's a few things packed in that question so
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 905.53 910.59 <NA> first is on on the pricing side i mean keep in mind
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 911.85 918.95 <NA> when we first started was literally ten or fifteen percent cheaper than our black car product it 's now
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 919.03 922.82 <NA> in many cities half the price of a taxi 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 922.81 929.85 <NA> and we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers what
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 929.78 935.25 <NA> <unk> happens is when the price goes down people are more likely to take uber
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 934.79 937.9 <NA> at different times of the day than they otherwise would have 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 937.66 945.43 <NA> and they 're more likely to use it in places they wouldn 't have before <unk> and what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 945.43 948.84 <NA> they 're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 948.38 950.02 <NA> and so what that means is
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 950 955.63 <NA> <unk> more trips per hour more minutes of the hour where they 're productive and actually earnings come up 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 955.63 964.22 <NA> and we have cities where we 've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time so even in new york
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 963.77 972.28 <NA> we have a blog post we call four septembers compare the earnings september after september after september same month every year 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 972.24 974.75 <NA> and we see the earnings going up over
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 977.05 981.56 <NA> <unk> as the price comes down and there 's a perfect price point you can 't go down forever <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 981.13 986.78 <NA> and in those places where we bring the price down but we don 't see those earnings pop we bring the prices back up 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 986.78 991.7 <NA> so that addresses that first part and then the enigma and and
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 991.78 999.56 <NA> all of this i mean the kind of entrepreneur i am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 999.1 1003.79 <NA> and the way i like to describe it is it 's kind of like a math professor 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1003.6 1004.97 <NA> you know if a
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1004.87 1009.89 <NA> <unk> math professor doesn 't have hard problems to solve that 's a really sad math professor
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1009.52 1016.26 <NA> <unk> and so at uber we like the hard problems and we like
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1016.08 1024.84 <NA> getting excited about those and solving them but we don 't want just any math problem we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find and we want the one that if you solve it
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1025.34 1027.6 <NA> <unk> there 's a little bit of a wow factor ca 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1027.56 1036.81 <NA> in a couple years ' time say five years ' time i don 't know when you roll out your incredible <unk> self driving cars <unk> at probably a lower cost than
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1036.71 1046.27 <NA> you currently pay for an uber ride what do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time tk explain that again at which time
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1055.04 1064.63 <NA> it 's likely going to take a lot longer than i think some of the hype or media might expect <unk> that 's part one part two is it 's going to also take
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1064.14 1070.06 <NA> there 's going to be a long transition these cars will work in certain places and not in others 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1070.29 1076.15 <NA> for us it 's an interesting challenge <unk> right because well
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1075.78 1079.97 <NA> google 's been investing in this since two thousand and seven tesla 's
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1079.96 1087.86 <NA> <unk> going to be doing it apple 's going to be doing it the manufacturers are going to be doing it this is a world that 's going to exist and for good reason
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1087.55 1090.74 <NA> a million people die a year in cars <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1090.74 1101.69 <NA> and we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them driving frustrated anxious and think about the quality of life that
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1101.44 1104.97 <NA> improves when you when you give people their time
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1104.78 1109.68 <NA> <unk> time back and it 's not so anxiety ridden so i think there 's a lot of good <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1109.22 1117.84 <NA> and so the way we think about it is that it 's a challenge but one for optimistic leadership where instead of resisting
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1117.41 1122.58 <NA> resisting technology maybe like the taxi industry or the trolley industry
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1123.14 1129.97 <NA> we have to embrace it or be a part of the future but how do we optimistically lead through it are there ways
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1129.93 1140.54 <NA> <unk> to partner with cities are there ways to have education systems vocational training etc for that transition period <unk> it will take a lot longer than i think we all expect especially that transition period <unk> 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1140.54 1145.45 <NA> but it is a world that 's going to exist and it is going to be a better world ca 
TravisKalanick_2016 1 TravisKalanick_2016 1145.5 1152.84 <NA> travis what you 're building is absolutely incredible and i 'm hugely grateful to you for coming to ted and sharing so openly thank you so much
