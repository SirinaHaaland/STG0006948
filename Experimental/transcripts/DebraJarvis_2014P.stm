DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 29.84 39.06 <NA> <unk> three things about yourself that will help me understand who you are three things that just get to your very essence 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 39.29 41.52 <NA> and what i 'm wondering
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 42.05 47.85 <NA> is of those three things is any one of them
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 47.45 51.33 <NA> surviving some kind of trauma

DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 71.43 79.97 <NA> survivor identity have the most consequences is in the cancer community and i 've been around this
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 79.9 87.47 <NA> <unk> community for a long time because i 've been a hospice and a hospital chaplain for almost thirty years 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 87.58 92.99 <NA> and in two thousand and five i was working at a big cancer center
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 93.79 99.02 <NA> when i received the news that my mother had breast cancer 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 99.19 103.52 <NA> and then five days later i received the news
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 103.12 104.97 <NA> that i had breast cancer
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 107.15 109.95 <NA> my mother and i can be competitive 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 111.17 112.44 <NA> laughter but
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 112.58 115.92 <NA> i was really not trying to compete with her on this one <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 115.76 119.91 <NA> and in fact i thought well if you have to have cancer it
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 119.63 127.23 <NA> 's pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people what 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 126.95 129.94 <NA> you 're the chaplain you should be
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 129.9 138.64 <NA> <unk> immune like <unk> maybe i should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket because i 'm on the force <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 139.44 145.39 <NA> so i did get my treatment at the cancer center where i worked which was amazingly convenient 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 145.39 153.53 <NA> and i had chemotherapy and a mastectomy and a saline implant put in and so before i say another word let me just say right now this is the fake one
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 156.48 162 <NA> laughter i have found that i need to get that out of the way <unk> because i 'll see somebody go
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 179.84 188.64 <NA> <unk> medicine most of it is about feelings and faith and losing and finding your identity
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 188.18 193.35 <NA> and discovering strength and flexibility you never even knew you had 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 193.58 199.29 <NA> it 's about realizing that the most important things in life are
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 198.86 199.99 <NA> not things
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 202.8 206.65 <NA> <unk> and it 's about laughing in the face of uncertainty
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 206.28 212.17 <NA> and learning that the way to get out of almost anything is to say i have cancer 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 213.54 221.95 <NA> so the other thing i learned was that i don 't have to take on cancer survivor as my identity 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 221.95 224.78 <NA> but boy are there powerful
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 224.62 229.94 <NA> forces pushing me to do just that now don 't
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 230.32 232.94 <NA> please misunderstand me 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 233.26 242.12 <NA> cancer organizations and the drive for early screening and cancer awareness and cancer research have normalized cancer 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 242.12 247.19 <NA> and this is a wonderful thing we can now talk about cancer without whispering <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 247 249.93 <NA> we can talk about cancer and we can support
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 252.14 260.13 <NA> <unk> but sometimes it feels like people go a little overboard and they start telling us how we 're going to feel <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 261.29 267.57 <NA> so about a week after my surgery we had a houseguest 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 267.89 276.58 <NA> that was probably our first mistake and keep in mind that at this point in my life i had been a chaplain for
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 276.42 279.94 <NA> over twenty years and issues like dying and death
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 279.63 284.83 <NA> <unk> death and the meaning of life <unk> these are all things i 'd been yakking about forever <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 284.43 292.03 <NA> so at dinner that night our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head and say you know deb 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 292.35 293.66 <NA> now
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 293.42 300.02 <NA> you 're really going to learn what 's important yes you are going to make some big changes in your
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 301.6 308.06 <NA> <unk> you 're going to start thinking about your death yep this cancer is your wakeup call 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 309.97 317.34 <NA> now these are golden words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 317.34 322.31 <NA> but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 321.82 323.96 <NA> it 's instant crap 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 324.49 329.97 <NA> the only reason i did not kill him with my bare hands was because i could
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 329.96 331.8 <NA> <unk> not lift my right arm <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 332.87 335.28 <NA> but i did say
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 334.79 340.68 <NA> a really bad word to him <unk> followed by a regular word that 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 341.51 345.36 <NA> made my husband say she 's on narcotics 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 347 350.2 <NA> and then after my treatment it just felt like everyone
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 350.16 361.08 <NA> <unk> was telling me what my experience was going to mean oh this means you 're going to be doing the walk oh this means you 're coming to the luncheon this means you 're going to be wearing the pink ribbon and the pink <unk> t shirt
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 361.09 365.74 <NA> and the headband and the earrings and the bracelet and the panties

DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 371.34 375.02 <NA> how is that raising awareness only my husband
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 377.71 380.21 <NA> <unk> he 's pretty aware of cancer already 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 382 387.92 <NA> it was at that point where i felt like oh my god this is just taking over my life 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 387.94 395.96 <NA> and that 's when i told myself claim your experience <unk> don 't let it claim you <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 397.15 399.84 <NA> we all know that the way to
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 405.65 407.49 <NA> <unk> is to find meaning <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 407.54 409.56 <NA> but here 's the thing <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 409.49 418.02 <NA> no one can tell us what our experience means <unk> we have to decide what it means and it
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 417.56 428.19 <NA> doesn 't have to be some gigantic <unk> extroverted meaning <unk> we don 't all have to start a foundation or an organization or write a book or make a documentary 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 429.87 431.11 <NA> <unk> can be
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 430.71 440.5 <NA> quiet and introverted <unk> maybe we make one small decision about our lives
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 440.34 441.91 <NA> that can bring about
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 441.68 443.59 <NA> big change
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 445.26 454.73 <NA> many years ago i had a patient just a wonderful young man who was loved by the staff <unk> and so it was something of a shock to us to
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 454.69 458.69 <NA> <unk> realize that he had no friends <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 458.38 461.06 <NA> he lived by himself <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 460.75 465.23 <NA> he would come in for chemotherapy by himself 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 464.83 470.21 <NA> he would receive his treatment <unk> and then he 'd walk home alone <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 470.47 474.89 <NA> and i even asked him i said hey how come you never bring a friend with you 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 477.29 479.55 <NA> <unk> really have any friends 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 479.66 487.9 <NA> but he had tons of friends on the infusion floor we all loved him and people were going in and out of his room all the time <unk> so
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 487.48 489.63 <NA> at his last chemo <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 489.56 497.34 <NA> we sang him the song and we put the crown on his head and we blew the bubbles <unk> and then i asked him i said so what
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 497 499.26 <NA> are you going to do now 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 500.51 501.91 <NA> and he answered
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 504.96 506.08 <NA> <unk> did 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 505.68 509.89 <NA> he started volunteering and he made friends there 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 509.43 517.6 <NA> and he began going to a church and he made friends there <unk> and at christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment and the place was filled
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 517.47 526.03 <NA> with his friends <unk> claim your experience <unk> don 't let it claim you he decided
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 526.03 528.65 <NA> that the meaning of his experience
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 529.93 536.27 <NA> <unk> was to know the joy of friendship <unk> and then learn to make friends <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 537.52 543.83 <NA> so what about you how are you going to find meaning
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 543.46 552 <NA> in your crappy experience <unk> it could be a recent one or it could be one that you 've been carrying around for a really long time
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 554.93 559.07 <NA> <unk> 's never too late to change what it means <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 559.08 566.49 <NA> because meaning is dynamic what it means today may not be what it means a year from now or ten years from now <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 567.02 575.2 <NA> it 's never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor <unk> hear how static
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 583.08 590.77 <NA> <unk> claim your experience <unk> don 't let it claim you because if you do i believe you will become trapped 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 590.49 594.61 <NA> you will not grow you will not evolve <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 596.49 604.01 <NA> but of course sometimes it 's not outside pressures that cause us to take on that identity of survivor
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 604.99 610.43 <NA> <unk> sometimes we just like the perks <unk> sometimes there 's a payoff <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 611.65 614.09 <NA> but then we get stuck 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 615.52 623.78 <NA> now one of the first things i learned as a chaplain intern was the three c 's of the chaplain 's job 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 623.65 624.9 <NA> comfort <unk>
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 630.86 632.46 <NA> <unk> or challenge 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 632.69 638.79 <NA> now we all pretty much love the comforting and the clarifying the confronting 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 638.78 640.74 <NA> not so much 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 642.14 646.11 <NA> one of the other things that i loved about being a chaplain was
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 646.34 654.58 <NA> seeing patients a year or even several years after their treatment because it was just really cool to see
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 655.02 664.63 <NA> <unk> they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them <unk> so i was thrilled one day to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 664.43 667.9 <NA> from a patient who i had seen the year before 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 667.74 674.77 <NA> and she was there with her two adult daughters who i also knew for her one year follow up exam <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 675.25 681.57 <NA> <unk> so i got down to the lobby and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 683.17 690.77 <NA> no evidence of disease <unk> which i used to think meant not entirely dead 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 691.15 699.77 <NA> so they were ecstatic <unk> we sat down to visit and it was so weird because
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 699.55 704.67 <NA> within two minutes she started retelling me the story of her
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 704.6 705.84 <NA> <unk> diagnosis
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 705.67 713.97 <NA> and her surgery and her chemo even though as her chaplain i saw her every week and so i knew this story <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 714.26 719.65 <NA> and she was using words like suffering <unk> agony
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 721.43 723.7 <NA> and she ended her story with
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 732.12 733.93 <NA> <unk> going to go get coffee 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 735.48 737.38 <NA> and they left 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 738.36 746.86 <NA> tell me three things about yourself before the next stop <unk> people were leaving the bus before she even got to number two or number three 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 749.37 754.52 <NA> so i handed her a tissue <unk> and i gave her a hug
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 756.16 761.36 <NA> and then because i really cared for this woman <unk> i said 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 761.74 766.82 <NA> get down off your cross and she said what and
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 768.82 774.78 <NA> i repeated get down off your cross and to her
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 776.36 779.91 <NA> <unk> she could talk about her reasons for
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 779.42 783.54 <NA> embracing and then clinging to this identity 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 783.35 789.15 <NA> it got her a lot of attention people were taking care of her for a change <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 788.96 795.3 <NA> but now it was having the opposite effect it was pushing people away 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 794.93 797.55 <NA> people kept leaving to get coffee <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 798.56 804.97 <NA> she felt crucified by her experience <unk> but she didn 't want to let that crucified

DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 808.62 814 <NA> now <unk> perhaps you are thinking i was a little harsh with her 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 814.5 817.1 <NA> so i must tell you that
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 816.74 820.42 <NA> i was speaking out of my own experience <unk> 
DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 820.56 829.88 <NA> many many years before i had been fired from a job that i loved and i would not stop talking about my

DebraJarvis_2014P 1 DebraJarvis_2014P 870.46 876.51 <NA> means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds
