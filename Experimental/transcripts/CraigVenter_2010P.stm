CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 413.14 422.43 <NA> had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us it 's an amazing
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 422.43 428.59 <NA> step forward <unk> but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 429.84 438.17 <NA> <unk> addition to doing the transplant we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it

CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 442.35 450.02 <NA> our team developed new techniques for actually growing cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast so we took

CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 594.39 600.16 <NA> there 's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error

CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 627.63 629.97 <NA> from the beginning we felt

CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 839.95 846.36 <NA> and the last one is a richard feynman quote what i cannot build i cannot understand
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 854.72 860.55 <NA> <unk> science <unk> we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side 
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 860.51 865.92 <NA> the last thing i want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 865.94 874.83 <NA> that we 've done asking for ethical review <unk> pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 874.4 879.97 <NA> this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community in the policy community
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 880.14 883.54 <NA> and at the highest levels of the federal government
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 883.05 884.36 <NA> even with
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 884.12 892.57 <NA> this announcement as we did in two thousand and three that work was funded by the department of energy <unk> so the work was reviewed
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 892.57 900.05 <NA> at the level of the white house <unk> trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it and they came down on the side of
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 901.12 903.71 <NA> <unk> which is the right approach
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 903.64 905.06 <NA> we 've
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 904.63 913.49 <NA> briefed the white house <unk> we 've briefed members of congress <unk> we 've tried to take and push the policy issues
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 913.24 916.79 <NA> in parallel with the scientific advances
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 916.54 923.79 <NA> <unk> so with that <unk> i would like to open it first to the floor for questions <unk> yes in the back
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 929.93 937.56 <NA> <unk> can we explain how significant this is i 'm not sure we 're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is it 's significant to us 
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 937.7 942.37 <NA> perhaps it 's a giant philosophical change in how we view life <unk> 
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 942.37 951.78 <NA> we actually view it as a baby step in terms of it 's taken us fifteen years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do fifteen years ago
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 951.38 954.73 <NA> on understanding life at its basic level
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 955.11 960.61 <NA> but we we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 960.87 964.93 <NA> and we 're already starting in numerous avenues
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 964.47 972.01 <NA> to use this tool <unk> we have at the institute ongoing funding now from nih
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 971.79 979.94 <NA> in a program with novartis to try and use these new synthetic dna tools to perhaps make the
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 979.95 987.65 <NA> flu vaccine that you might get next year because instead of taking weeks to months to make these 
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 987.94 992.72 <NA> dan 's team can now make these in less than twenty four hours 
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 992.35 998.7 <NA> so when you see how long it took to get an h1n1 vaccine out we think we can shorten that process
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 998.49 999.87 <NA> quite substantially
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1000.22 1009.23 <NA> <unk> in the vaccine area synthetic genomics and the the institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1009.16 1016.76 <NA> to diseases that haven 't been possible to date <unk> things where the viruses rapidly evolve <unk> such with rhinovirus wouldn
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1016.42 1020.3 <NA> 't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds 
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1020.23 1025.17 <NA> or more importantly hiv where the virus evolves so quickly
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1025.01 1028.43 <NA> the vaccines that are made today can 't
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1028.45 1029.94 <NA> keep up with those
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1029.87 1031.74 <NA> <unk> evolutionary changes
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1031.79 1038.7 <NA> also at synthetic genomics <unk> we 've been working on major environmental issues i think
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1038.42 1046.22 <NA> this latest oil spill in the gulf is a is a reminder we can 't see see co2 we depend on scientific measurements for it
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1046.22 1050.19 <NA> and we see the beginning results of having too much of it
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1050.09 1054.67 <NA> but we can see pre co2 now floating on the waters and
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1055.23 1059.56 <NA> <unk> contaminating the beaches in the gulf we need some alternatives
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1059.58 1067.3 <NA> for oil <unk> we have a program with exxon mobile to try and develop new strains of algae
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1067.1 1076.56 <NA> that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries
CraigVenter_2010P 1 CraigVenter_2010P 1076.56 1083.66 <NA> to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of co2 those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we 're taking
