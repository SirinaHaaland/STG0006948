CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 308.53 318.8 <NA> nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family <unk> so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene <unk>

CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 407.2 410.61 <NA> so for example this would be one sentence <unk>

CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 450 457.44 <NA> sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family <unk> you can see that the repeat units differ in length <unk> 
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 457.26 467.51 <NA> they also differ in sequence so i 've colored in the glycines again in green alanine in red <unk> and the serines the letter s in purple <unk> and you can <unk>
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 467.41 475.26 <NA> <unk> see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red <unk> and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 475.94 484.14 <NA> <unk> what silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences these amino acid sequences <unk> to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers <unk> 
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 484.14 490.72 <NA> now <unk> it 's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body this makes
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 490.53 499.96 <NA> testing spider silk really really easy to do in the laboratory <unk> because we 're actually you know testing it in air that 's exactly the environment that spiders are are using
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 501.12 510.04 <NA> <unk> so this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing which is basically you know tugging on one end of the fiber very amenable

CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 527.77 539.51 <NA> if you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers <unk> you can see that there 's a lot of variation and in fact dragline or major ampullate silk is the strongest of these fibers 
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 539.26 547.07 <NA> we think that 's because the dragline silk which is used to make the frame and radii for a web <unk> needs to be very strong 
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 546.7 554.97 <NA> on the other hand if you were to look at strain this is how much a fiber can be extended if you look at the maximum value here again
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 554.96 565.53 <NA> <unk> there 's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform or the capture spiral filament in fact <unk> this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length <unk> 
CherylHayashi_2010 1 CherylHayashi_2010 565.28 567.61 <NA> so silk fibers vary
