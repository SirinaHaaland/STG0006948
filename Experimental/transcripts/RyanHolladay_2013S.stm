RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 34.66 39.45 <NA> but to anyone who hasn 't visited these images can 't really fully convey 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 40.19 44.55 <NA> to really understand central park you have to physically be there
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 45.47 48.09 <NA> <unk> well the same is true of the music <unk>
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 49.9 54.94 <NA> which my brother and i composed and mapped specifically for central park
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 61.35 65.8 <NA> i 'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 66.48 75.23 <NA> that 's us there that 's both of us actually specifically about a concept that we 've been developing over the last few years this idea of
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 79.99 84.89 <NA> <unk> and music producers we 've been working together since well since we were kids really <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 84.58 92.18 <NA> but recently we 've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 91.84 96.32 <NA> from creating sight specific audio and video installation
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 96.01 104.97 <NA> to engineering interactive concerts <unk> but today i want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 105.01 111.42 <NA> <unk> but before i go too much further into that let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 111.8 119.49 <NA> my brother and i were living in new york city when the artists christo and jeanne claude did their temporary installation the gates in central park <unk>

RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 124.34 129.97 <NA> and unlike work that 's exhibited in a more neutral space like on the walls of a gallery or a
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 129.9 136.63 <NA> <unk> museum this was work that was really in dialogue with this place and in a lot of ways the gates
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 136.4 140.86 <NA> was really a celebration of frederick olmsted 's incredible design 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 140.91 150.05 <NA> this was an experience that stayed with us for a long time and years later <unk> my brother and i moved back to washington d c and we started to ask the question
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 150.67 156.77 <NA> <unk> would it be possible in the same way that the gates responded to the physical layout of the park 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 156.67 160.37 <NA> to compose music for a landscape <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 161.47 163.64 <NA> which brought us to this 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 169.03 172.58 <NA> on memorial day <unk> we released the national mall <unk>
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 174.34 179.58 <NA> <unk> album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device 's

RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 190.3 195.7 <NA> hundreds of musical segments are geo tagged throughout the entire park
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 195.7 204.94 <NA> so that as a listener traverses the landscape a musical score is actually unfolding around them so this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 204.9 206.32 <NA> <unk> for the park 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 206.43 216.28 <NA> but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener 's chosen trajectory <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 216.06 217.85 <NA> so think of this as a
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 218.88 220.12 <NA> <unk> of an album <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 220.29 229.52 <NA> let 's take a closer look let 's look at one example here so using the app as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the washington monument
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 229.96 232.73 <NA> <unk> you hear the sounds of instruments warming up
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 233.8 239.21 <NA> which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 241.39 244.35 <NA> this is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 255.44 256.84 <NA> fireworks
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 256.63 259.09 <NA> and all sorts of musical craziness 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 259.09 265.14 <NA> as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 266.54 273.03 <NA> but were you to walk in the opposite direction this entire sequence happens in reverse and
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 275.04 282.31 <NA> <unk> and were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park the music would fade to silence and the play button would disappear <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 283.44 290.53 <NA> we 're sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can 't travel to the united states but would like to hear this record <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 290.46 298.78 <NA> well <unk> unlike a normal album we haven 't been able to accommodate this request when they ask for a c d or an mp3 version 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 298.29 300.97 <NA> we just can 't make that happen 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 300.66 302.48 <NA> and the reason is
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 302.29 304.94 <NA> is because this isn 't a promotional app
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 305.01 309.65 <NA> or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 309.49 313.73 <NA> in this case the app is the work itself 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 313.27 318.71 <NA> and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 319.78 324.44 <NA> six months later we did a location aware album for central park 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 324.44 329.97 <NA> a park that is over two times the size of the national mall with music spanning from the sheep 's

RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 344.09 349.84 <NA> where we 're creating our largest <unk> location aware album to date one that will span the entirety of highway one here on the
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 351.81 358.42 <NA> <unk> but what we 're doing <unk> integrating gps with music is really just one idea <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 358.11 365.53 <NA> but it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that 's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 365.25 372.17 <NA> that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model <unk> 
RyanHolladay_2013S 1 RyanHolladay_2013S 372.17 375.83 <NA> but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with
