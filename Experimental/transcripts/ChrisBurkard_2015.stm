ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 236.62 240.77 <NA> i began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane <unk> 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 240.91 245.63 <NA> because if there 's one thing i 've realized <unk> it 's that any career

ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 269.66 273.33 <NA> where i began to look <unk> and it was my first trip to iceland
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 273.17 279.88 <NA> that i felt like i found exactly what i was looking for i was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape

ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 288.39 298.67 <NA> we got to the beach only to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline they created this barrier between us and the surf and we had to weave through this thing like a maze just to get out into the

ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 321.67 329.97 <NA> i was hooked <unk> i was hooked cold water was constantly on my mind and from that point on my career focused
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 330.02 339.18 <NA> <unk> on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments and it took me to places like russia norway alaska iceland chile the faroe islands and a lot of places in between <unk> 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 338.96 342.57 <NA> and one of my favorite things about these places
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 342.17 353.14 <NA> was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there hours days weeks spent on google earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 353.14 354.88 <NA> and once we got there the

ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 368.04 374.14 <NA> there was this one particularly bumpy boat ride up the coast of vancouver island to this kind of remote surf spot 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 374.01 380 <NA> where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our camp site they walked off with our food

ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 389.01 393.89 <NA> was a testament to the wildness i traded for those touristy beaches <unk> 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 395.32 398.24 <NA> now it wasn 't until i traveled to norway 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 398.53 404.97 <NA> laughter that i really learned to appreciate the cold <unk> so this is the
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 404.93 405.98 <NA> <unk> place
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 405.73 414.72 <NA> where some of the largest the most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline we were in this tiny remote fjord

ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 416.33 422.22 <NA> it had a greater population of sheep than people so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 422.27 427.14 <NA> i was in the water taking pictures of surfers <unk> and it started to snow 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 428.06 429.64 <NA> and then the temperature
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 430.08 432.01 <NA> began to drop <unk> 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 432.81 441.17 <NA> and i told myself there 's not a chance you 're getting out of the water you traveled all this way and this is exactly what you 've been waiting for freezing cold conditions with perfect waves 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 441.17 448.69 <NA> and although i couldn 't even feel my finger to push the trigger i knew i wasn 't getting out so i just did whatever i could i shook it off whatever but
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 448.32 454.97 <NA> that was the point that i felt this wind gush through the valley and hit me and what started as this light snowfall
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 455.1 460.51 <NA> quickly became a full on blizzard <unk> and i started to lose perception
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 460.52 470.15 <NA> of where i was i didn 't know if i was drifting out to sea or towards shore <unk> and all i could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 469.66 474.99 <NA> and crashing waves <unk> now i knew this place had a reputation for
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 477.62 482.19 <NA> <unk> was out there floating i started to get a little bit nervous 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 482.42 490.59 <NA> actually i was totally freaking out and i was borderline hypothermic and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water <unk> 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 490.88 493.69 <NA> and i don 't know if it was delirium setting in
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 493.52 498.93 <NA> or what but they told me later i had a smile on my face
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 498.68 500.46 <NA> the entire time 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 501.71 504.88 <NA> now it was this trip and
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 504.84 511.57 <NA> <unk> probably that exact experience where i really began to feel like every photograph was precious
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 512.13 516.52 <NA> because all of a sudden in that moment it was something i was forced to earn <unk> 
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 516.72 525.02 <NA> and i realized all this shivering had actually taught me something in life there are no shortcuts

ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 536.02 542.42 <NA> it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines

ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 547.09 552.05 <NA> in these places <unk> and what i walked away with
ChrisBurkard_2015 1 ChrisBurkard_2015 552.49 554.22 <NA> was a sense of fulfillment
