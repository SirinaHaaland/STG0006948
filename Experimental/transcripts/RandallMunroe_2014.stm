RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 13.18 18.98 <NA> <unk> i have a feature on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 18.76 29.51 <NA> and i try to answer them using math science and comics so for example one person asked what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at ninety percent of the speed of light 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 30.19 32.25 <NA> i did some calculations now 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 32.09 44.1 <NA> normally when an object flies through the air the air will flow around the object but in this case the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn 't have time to move out of the way the ball would smash right into and through them 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 43.79 54.79 <NA> and the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen carbon and hydrogen from the ball fragmenting it off into tiny particles <unk> and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 55.14 69.64 <NA> <unk> this would result in a flood of x rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles plasma inside centered on the pitcher 's mound <unk> and that would move away from the pitcher 's mound slightly faster than the ball <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 69.3 79.88 <NA> now at this point about thirty nanoseconds in the home plate is far enough away that light hasn 't had time to reach it which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 79.84 83.18 <NA> <unk> throw and has no idea that anything is wrong 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 84.25 85.73 <NA> now <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 85.6 93.02 <NA> after seventy nanoseconds the ball will reach home plate or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 93.07 100.98 <NA> <unk> and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 100.8 104.85 <NA> and start disintegrating them all as it also
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 104.81 109.8 <NA> <unk> starts to carry them backward through the backstop which also starts to disintegrate
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 109.88 115.86 <NA> so if you were watching this whole thing from a hill <unk> ideally far away
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 116 123.54 <NA> <unk> what you 'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds followed by a blast wave spreading out shredding trees
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 123.11 125.02 <NA> and houses as it moves away from the
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 126.87 132.46 <NA> <unk> and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 132.36 137.05 <NA> so the major league baseball rules are a little bit hazy but 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 136.89 145.25 <NA> laughter under rule six point zero two and five point zero nine <unk> i think that in this situation the batter would be considered hit by pitch
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 145.06 154.94 <NA> and would be eligible to take first base if it still existed <unk> so this is the kind of question i answer <unk> and i get people writing in with
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 154.96 167.42 <NA> <unk> a lot of other strange questions <unk> i 've had someone write and say <unk> scientifically speaking what is the best and fastest way to hide a body can you do this one soon <unk> and i had someone write in <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 167.23 173.33 <NA> i 've had people write in about can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart 's broken
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 172.87 178.71 <NA> and i 've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they 're trying to get me to do for them
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 180.65 182.1 <NA> <unk> but one one week 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 181.9 186.63 <NA> a couple months ago i got a question that was actually about google 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 186.63 192.36 <NA> if all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards how big would google 's data warehouse be 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 191.93 203.24 <NA> now google 's pretty secretive about their operations so no one really knows how much data google has and in fact no one really knows how many data centers google has except people at google itself <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 203.24 204.82 <NA> and i 've tried i 've met them a few times
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 205.02 209.59 <NA> <unk> asking them and they aren 't revealing anything <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 209.43 214.52 <NA> so i decided to try to figure this out myself there are a few things that i looked at here <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 214.52 222.7 <NA> i started with money google has to reveal how much they spend in general and that lets you put some caps on
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 222.39 229.97 <NA> how many data centers could they be building because a big data center costs a certain amount of money <unk> and you can also then put a cap on how much of the
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 229.93 238.04 <NA> <unk> world hard drive market are they taking up which turns out it 's pretty sizable <unk> i read a calculation at one point i think google has a drive failure about
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 238.12 244.94 <NA> every minute or two and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one so they go through a huge number of them
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 244.78 252.77 <NA> <unk> and so by looking at money you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have you can also look at power you can look at how much
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 252.67 254.61 <NA> electricity they need
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 254.99 263.16 <NA> <unk> you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers and google is more efficient than most but they still have some basic requirements and that lets you put a
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 263.06 268.3 <NA> limit on the number of servers that they have you can also look at square footage and see
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 268.3 274.93 <NA> of the data centers that you know how big are they how much room is that how many server racks could you fit in
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 276.3 281.06 <NA> <unk> for some data centers you might get two of these pieces of information you know how much they spent <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 281.06 289.01 <NA> and they also say because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided you might know what they made a deal to
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 288.68 293.43 <NA> to buy so you know how much power it takes <unk> then you can look at the ratios of those numbers <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 293.43 300.05 <NA> and figure out for a data center where you don 't have that information <unk> you can figure out but maybe you only have one of those you know
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 300.04 303.6 <NA> <unk> the square footage then you could figure out well maybe the power is proportional <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 303.6 311.04 <NA> and you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities you know with guesses about the total amount of storage the number of servers the number of drives per server <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 310.8 325.23 <NA> and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don 't know it 's sort of circling around the number you 're trying to get and this is a lot of fun the math is not all that advanced
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 327.5 333.15 <NA> <unk> 's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle <unk> so what i did <unk> i
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 333.08 342.72 <NA> went through all of this information <unk> spent a day or two researching and there are some things i didn 't look at you could always look at the google <unk>
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 342.62 350.86 <NA> <unk> recruitment messages that they post that gives you an idea of where they have people sometimes when people visit a data center they 'll take a cell cam photo and post it and they
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 354.96 361.75 <NA> <unk> can just look at pizza delivery drivers turns out they know where all the google data centers are at least the ones that have people in them
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 361.77 367.48 <NA> <unk> but i came up with my estimate <unk> which i felt pretty good about that was about
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 367.05 374.96 <NA> about ten exabytes of data across all of google 's operations <unk> and then another maybe five exabytes
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 375.82 383.12 <NA> <unk> offline storage in tape drives which it turns out google is about the world 's largest consumer of so
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 382.63 393.44 <NA> i came up with this estimate and this this is a staggering amount of data it 's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has as far as we know there 's a couple of other contenders especially <unk>
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 393.39 404.22 <NA> everyone always thinks of the nsa but using some of these same methods we can look at the nsa 's data centers and figure out you know we don 't know what 's going on there but it 's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of google
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 404.81 415.35 <NA> <unk> adding all of this up i came up with the other thing that we can answer which is how many punch cards would this take <unk> and so a punch card can hold about eighty characters <unk>
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 415.3 429.97 <NA> <unk> and you can fit about two thousand or so cards into a box <unk> and you put them in say my home region of new england it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers <unk> which is about three times deeper than
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 429.99 437.21 <NA> <unk> the glaciers during the last ice age about twenty thousand years ago <unk> so this is this is impractical but i think
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 437.21 444.67 <NA> that 's about the best answer i could come up with <unk> and i posted it on my website i wrote it up and i didn 't expect to get an answer from google 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 444.96 449.93 <NA> because of course they 've been so secretive they didn 't answer of my questions and so i just put it up and said
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 451.63 453.59 <NA> <unk> but then a little while later
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 453.42 458.69 <NA> i got a message a couple weeks later from google saying hey someone here has an envelope for you <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 458.68 464.33 <NA> so i go and get it <unk> open it up and it 's punch cards 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 464.38 467.39 <NA> google branded punch cards <unk> 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 467.11 479.97 <NA> and on these punch cards there are a bunch of holes and i said thank you thank you <unk> okay so what 's on here <unk> so i get some software and start reading it and scan them and it turns out it 's a puzzle <unk> there 's a bunch of code
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 480.37 494.35 <NA> and i get some friends to help and we we crack the code and then inside that is another code and then there are some equations and then we solve those equations <unk> and then finally out pops a message from google which is their official answer to my article <unk> and it said
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 509.79 515.27 <NA> <unk> and it 's not that i love doing the math i do a lot of math <unk> but i don 't really like math for its own sake
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 515.27 521.05 <NA> <unk> what i love is that it lets you take some things that you know <unk> and just by
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 521.91 529.94 <NA> moving symbols around on a piece of paper <unk> find out something that you didn 't know that 's very surprising <unk> and i have a lot of stupid questions
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 529.9 533.3 <NA> <unk> and i love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 533.86 538.56 <NA> and sometimes not this is a question i got from a reader 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 538.38 543.95 <NA> an anonymous reader and the subject line just said urgent and this was the entire email 
RandallMunroe_2014 1 RandallMunroe_2014 543.95 548.76 <NA> if people had wheels and could fly how would we differentiate them from airplanes
