AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 31.12 39.96 <NA> google maps think gps the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation so let 's take a look at the brain <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 40.16 54.91 <NA> most people when they first look at a fresh human brain they say it doesn 't look what you 're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain typically what you 're looking at is a fixed brain <unk> it 's gray <unk> and this outer layer this is the vasculature which is incredible
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 54.84 65.23 <NA> <unk> around a human brain <unk> this is the blood vessels twenty percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs <unk> twenty percent of the blood pumped from your heart is servicing <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 65.13 70.78 <NA> <unk> this one organ that 's basically if you hold two fists together it 's just slightly larger than the two fists 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 79.81 81.74 <NA> <unk> going on in the human brain <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 81.31 91.65 <NA> so for example they can see in the back part of the brain which is just turning around there there 's the cerebellum that 's keeping you upright right now it 's keeping me standing it 's involved in coordinated movement 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 91.6 104.97 <NA> <unk> on the side here this is temporal cortex this is the area where primary auditory processing so you 're hearing my words you 're sending it up into higher language processing centers towards the front of the brain is the place in which all

AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 118.55 124.93 <NA> so if you take a deeper look at the brain one of the things if you look at it in cross section what you can see is that
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 125 135.49 <NA> can 't really see a whole lot of structure there <unk> but there 's actually a lot of structure there it 's cells and it 's wires all wired together <unk> so about a hundred years ago some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 135.44 145.63 <NA> and that 's shown here in the the very light blue you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained and what you can see is it 's very non uniform you see a lot more structure there <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 145.58 154.91 <NA> so the outer part of that brain is the neocortex it 's one continuous processing unit if you will <unk> but you can also see things underneath there as well
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 154.96 165.08 <NA> <unk> all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through they 're probably less cell dense so there 's about <unk> eighty six billion neurons in our brain and as you can see they <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 164.98 179.94 <NA> <unk> 're very non uniformly distributed and how they 're distributed really contributes to their underlying function and of course as i mentioned before <unk> since we can now start to map brain function we can start to tie these into the individual cells so let 's
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 179.9 189.76 <NA> <unk> take a deeper look let 's look at neurons <unk> so as i mentioned there are eighty six billion neurons there are also these smaller cells as you 'll see these are support cells astrocytes glia 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 189.55 203.41 <NA> and the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input they 're storing it they 're processing it <unk> each neuron is connected via synapses to up to ten thousand other neurons in your brain 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 203.41 204.97 <NA> and each neuron
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 204.93 215.44 <NA> <unk> itself is largely unique the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 215.34 225.05 <NA> <unk> biochemistry these are proteins they 're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement <unk> they 're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 225.58 232.82 <NA> <unk> they 're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do so if we zoom in to an even deeper level 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 232.65 243.17 <NA> all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes <unk> we each have twenty three pairs of chromosomes we get one from mom one from dad and on these chromosomes <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 243.07 248.34 <NA> <unk> are roughly twenty five thousand genes they 're encoded in the dna and
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 254.84 256.78 <NA> <unk> thousand genes are turned on
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 256.57 267.61 <NA> and at what level they 're turned on and so our project is seeking to look at this readout understanding which of these twenty five thousand genes is turned on <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 267.61 275.23 <NA> so in order to undertake such a project we obviously need brains <unk> so we sent our lab technician out
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 276.3 286.72 <NA> <unk> we were seeking normal human brains what we actually start with is a medical examiner 's office this a place where the dead are brought in <unk> we are seeking normal human brains <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 286.67 297.91 <NA> there 's a lot of criteria by which we 're selecting these brains we want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of twenty to sixty they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 301.09 303.9 <NA> <unk> no drugs on board we do a toxicology workup 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 303.9 314.72 <NA> and we 're very careful about the brains that we do take we 're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue we can get consent to take the tissue
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 314.26 322.67 <NA> within twenty four hours of time of death <unk> because what we 're trying to measure the rna which is the readout from our genes is
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 322.24 324.99 <NA> very labile and so so we have to move very
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 326.18 336.33 <NA> <unk> side note on the collection of brains <unk> because of the way that we collect and because we require consent we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains males are much more likely to <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 336.23 342.73 <NA> <unk> die an accidental death in the prime of their life <unk> and men are much more likely to have their significant other 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 348.59 354.85 <NA> so the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what 's called an mr this is magnetic resonance imaging
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 354.87 365.02 <NA> <unk> mri <unk> it 's a standard template by which we 're going to hang the rest of this data so we collect this mr and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map the next thing we do is we <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 364.92 373.96 <NA> <unk> collect what 's called a diffusion tensor imaging this maps the large cabling in the brain and again you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways if you will 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 375.79 379.18 <NA> <unk> and then it 's sliced into one centimeter slices <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 379.19 392.12 <NA> and those are frozen solid <unk> and they 're shipped to seattle and in seattle <unk> we take these this is a whole human hemisphere and we put them into what 's basically a glorified meat slicer there 's a blade here that 's going to cut across a section of
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 391.69 399.81 <NA> the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide we 're going to then apply one of those stains to it <unk> and we scan it and then what we get is our
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 401.18 410.1 <NA> <unk> so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments you could consider this state boundaries if you will those pretty broad outlines 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 409.76 413.95 <NA> from this we 're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 413.95 425.14 <NA> which then we can put on a smaller cryostat <unk> and this is just showing this here this frozen tissue and it 's being cut <unk> this is twenty microns thin so this is about a baby hair 's width and remember it 's frozen and so
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 425.16 431.44 <NA> <unk> you can see here old fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied we take a microscope slide <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 431.28 439.69 <NA> then we very carefully melt onto the slide <unk> this will then go onto a robot that 's going to apply one of those stains to it
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 443.07 454.97 <NA> and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this so again this is what they can see under the microscope you can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places and from there it 's routine
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 455.01 461.6 <NA> <unk> they understand where to make these assignments and they can make basically what 's a reference atlas this is a more detailed map 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 461.68 475.02 <NA> our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what 's called laser scanning microdissection <unk> so the technician takes the instructions they scribe along a place there <unk> and then the laser actually cuts
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 475.01 485.28 <NA> <unk> you can see that blue dot there cutting <unk> and that tissue falls off you can see on the microscope slide here that 's what 's happening in real time there 's a container underneath that 's collecting that tissue <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 485.28 492.03 <NA> we take that tissue <unk> we purify the rna out of it using some basic technology
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 491.57 504.7 <NA> and then we put a florescent tag on it <unk> we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray now this may look like a bunch of dots to you but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 505.14 515.29 <NA> <unk> that we spotted down on glass this has roughly sixty thousand elements on it so we repeatedly measure various genes of the twenty five thousand genes in the genome and when we take a <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 515.19 529.97 <NA> <unk> sample and we hybridize it to it <unk> we get a unique fingerprint if you will <unk> quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample now we do this over and over again this process for any given brain we 're taking over a thousand samples for
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 529.96 540.14 <NA> <unk> each brain <unk> this area shown here is an area called the hippocampus it 's involved in learning and memory and it contributes to about seventy samples of those thousand samples <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 539.77 545.09 <NA> so each sample gets us about fifty thousand data points
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 544.6 551.79 <NA> with repeat measurements a thousand samples so roughly we have fifty million data points for a given human brain <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 551.79 554.97 <NA> we 've done right now two human brains worth of data
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 555.47 567.99 <NA> we 've put all of that together into one thing and i 'll show you what that synthesis looks like it 's basically a large data set of information that 's all freely available to any scientist around the world they don 't even
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 567.99 574.41 <NA> have to log in to come use this tool <unk> mine this data find interesting things out with this 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 574.22 579.97 <NA> so here 's the modalities that we put together you 'll start to recognize these things from what we 've collected before
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 580.25 590.27 <NA> here 's the mr it provides the framework there 's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn <unk> it allows you to zoom in <unk> it allows you to highlight individual structures <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 590.27 604.94 <NA> but most importantly <unk> we 're now mapping into this anatomic framework which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on so the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree green is the sort of cool areas where it 's
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 604.9 614.48 <NA> <unk> not turned on and each gene gives us a fingerprint and remember that we 've assayed all the twenty five thousand genes in the genome and have all of that data available 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 615.94 625.14 <NA> so what can scientists learn about this data <unk> we 're just starting to to look at this data ourselves there 's some basic things that you would want to understand two great
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 627.38 637.59 <NA> <unk> prozac and wellbutrin these are commonly prescribed antidepressants now remember we 're assaying genes genes send the instructions to make proteins proteins are <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 637.49 647.85 <NA> <unk> targets for drugs so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off etc <unk> so if you want to understand the action of drugs you want to understand how they 're acting in the ways you want them to <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 647.8 654.94 <NA> and also in the ways you don 't want them to in the side effect profile etc you want to see where those genes are turned on and for the first time
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 654.96 660.73 <NA> <unk> can actually do that we can do that in multiple individuals that we 've assayed too so now we can look
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 660.24 671.02 <NA> throughout the brain we can see this unique fingerprint <unk> and we get confirmation we get confirmation that indeed the gene is turned on for something like prozac in serotonergic <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 670.97 679.64 <NA> structures things that are already known be affected but we also get to see the whole thing we also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before and we see these genes turned on there
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 680.02 682.17 <NA> <unk> as interesting a side effect as it could be 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 681.96 692.51 <NA> one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can <unk> because it 's a pattern matching exercise because there 's unique fingerprint <unk> we can actually scan through the entire genome and find <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 692.46 704.97 <NA> other proteins that show a similar fingerprint <unk> so if you 're in drug discovery for example you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 704.93 706.11 <NA> <unk> optimize <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 706.34 716.43 <NA> most of you are probably familiar with genome wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying scientists have recently discovered the gene <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 716.33 728.97 <NA> <unk> or genes which affect x and so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they 're great they analyze large populations they look at their entire genomes and they try to find hot spots of activity
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 730.01 740.74 <NA> causally to genes but what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes it tells you the what <unk> but it doesn 't tell you the where <unk> and so it 's very important for
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 740.51 752.53 <NA> those researchers that we 've created this resource now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity they can start to look at common pathways other things that they simply haven 't been able to do before <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 752.94 754.97 <NA> so i think this
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 755.04 764.09 <NA> audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality <unk> and i think every human <unk> we all have different
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 763.87 775.08 <NA> genetic backgrounds we all have lived separate lives <unk> but the fact is our genomes are greater than ninety nine percent similar we 're similar at the genetic
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 775.85 786.81 <NA> <unk> and what we 're finding is actually even at the brain biochemical level <unk> we are quite similar <unk> and so this shows it 's not ninety nine percent but it 's roughly ninety percent correspondence <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 786.76 801.13 <NA> at a reasonable cutoff <unk> so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated <unk> and then we find some outliers some things that lie beyond the cloud and those genes are interesting but they 're very subtle <unk> so i think
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 804.84 811.03 <NA> <unk> though we celebrate all of our differences <unk> we are quite similar even at the brain level <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 811.14 824.96 <NA> now what do those differences look like <unk> this is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were and they 're quite subtle <unk> these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type these are two genes that we found
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 825.19 835.31 <NA> <unk> as good examples one is called reln it 's involved in early developmental cues disc1 is a gene that 's deleted in schizophrenia these aren 't schizophrenic individuals <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 835.26 845.72 <NA> but they do show some population variation <unk> and so what you 're looking at here in donor one and donor four which are the exceptions to the other two that genes <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 845.62 854.04 <NA> <unk> are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells it 's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that 's telling us a gene is turned on there <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 854.9 864.03 <NA> <unk> due to an individual 's genetic background or their experiences <unk> we don 't know those kinds of studies require much larger populations <unk> 
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 865.25 874.95 <NA> so i 'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go i think these resources are incredibly valuable <unk>
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 874.9 879.97 <NA> they give researchers a handle on where to go but we only looked at a handful
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 879.96 883.27 <NA> <unk> of individuals at this point we 're certainly going to be looking at more i 'll
AllanJones_2011G 1 AllanJones_2011G 883.27 893.32 <NA> just close by saying that that the the tools are there <unk> and this is truly an unexplored undiscovered continent this is the
