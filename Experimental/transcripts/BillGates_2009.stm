BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 15.1 16.46 <NA> <unk> i wrote a letter
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 16.12 21.62 <NA> last week talking about the work of the foundation <unk> sharing some of the problems 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 21.43 29.43 <NA> and warren buffet had recommended i do that being honest about what was going well what wasn 't and making it kind of an annual thing
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 30.08 33.13 <NA> <unk> a goal i had there was to draw more people in
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 33.13 44.02 <NA> to work on those problems because i think there are some very important problems that don 't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 43.57 48.48 <NA> the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 48.48 54.94 <NA> to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 55.2 60.07 <NA> and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 59.91 65.86 <NA> so this morning i 'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 65.67 74.09 <NA> but before i dive into those i i want to admit that i am an optimist any tough problem i think it it can be solved <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 74.09 78.35 <NA> and part of the reason i i feel that way is looking at the past over the
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 80.02 82.67 <NA> <unk> average lifespan has more than doubled <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 82.57 88.37 <NA> another statistic <unk> perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 88.06 91.43 <NA> as recently as one thousand nine hundred and sixty <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 91.43 98.22 <NA> one hundred and and ten million children were born <unk> and twenty million of those died before the age of five 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 98.04 100.05 <NA> five years ago <unk> one hundred
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 100.88 107.19 <NA> <unk> million children were born so more and less than ten million of them died before the age of five 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 106.96 110.25 <NA> so that 's a factor of two reduction
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 110.25 117.51 <NA> of the childhood death rate it 's a phenomenal thing each one of those lives matters a lot <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 117.35 129.97 <NA> and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs <unk> vaccines that were used more widely <unk> for example measles was four
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 130.05 131.71 <NA> <unk> million of the deaths
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 131.48 139.94 <NA> back as recently as one thousand nine hundred and ninety and now is under four hundred thousand <unk> so we really can make changes the next breakthrough
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 139.94 145.49 <NA> is to cut that ten million in half again <unk> and i think that 's doable in
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 145.25 154.7 <NA> well under twenty years <unk> why well there 's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 154.81 158.18 <NA> diarrhea <unk> pneumonia
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 157.93 163.25 <NA> and malaria <unk> so that brings us to the the first problem
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 162.76 170.96 <NA> that i 'll raise this morning which is how do we stop a deadly disease that 's spread by mosquitos well 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 171.64 179.67 <NA> what 's the history of this disease it 's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact if we look at the genetic code
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 179.93 185.31 <NA> <unk> only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 185.31 193.44 <NA> to avoid malarial deaths deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the <unk>
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 194.62 199.93 <NA> so it was absolutely gigantic <unk> and the disease was all over the world
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 200.01 205.85 <NA> <unk> terrible disease it was in the united states it was in europe people didn 't know what caused it until
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 205.64 215.08 <NA> the early 1900s when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos <unk> so it was everywhere
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 215.28 216.91 <NA> <unk> and
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 216.57 224.96 <NA> two tools helped bring the death rate down one was killing the mosquitos with ddt the other was treating the patients
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 225 227.93 <NA> with quinine or quinine derivatives <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 227.68 240.03 <NA> and so that 's why the death rate did come down <unk> now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where the rich countries are so we can see one thousand nine hundred it 's everywhere one thousand nine
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 239.82 243.08 <NA> hundred and forty five it 's still most places one thousand nine
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 243.08 254.19 <NA> hundred and seventy the u s and most of europe have gotten rid of it one thousand nine hundred and ninety you 've gotten most of the northern areas and more recently you can see it 's just around the equator
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 255.02 259.53 <NA> <unk> and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 259.3 267.63 <NA> is only in the poorer countries it doesn 't get much investment for example there 's more money
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 267.62 275.08 <NA> put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness it 's a terrible thing
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 280.02 285.4 <NA> <unk> are afflicted <unk> and so that 's why that priority
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 285.57 287.63 <NA> has been set <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 287.39 293.66 <NA> but malaria even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 293.66 297.58 <NA> over two hundred million people at any one time are suffering from it it
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 297.39 304.97 <NA> means that you can 't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 304.99 312.41 <NA> <unk> much now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos <unk> i brought some here just so you could
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 312.52 316.25 <NA> experience this we 'll let those roam around the
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 317.17 323.55 <NA> auditorium a little bit there 's no reason only poor people should have
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 336.77 338.85 <NA> <unk> come up with a few new things 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 338.45 346.41 <NA> we 've got bed nets <unk> and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 345.92 350.05 <NA> so the mosquitos that bite late at night
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 349.87 354.49 <NA> can 't get at them and when you use indoor spraying
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 355.05 363.58 <NA> <unk> with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over fifty percent <unk> and that 's happened now in a number of countries <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 363.45 375.8 <NA> it 's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we 've ever had in the past
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 375.62 379.85 <NA> has eventually become ineffective <unk> and so you end up with two
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 379.81 391.82 <NA> <unk> choices <unk> if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously <unk> you can actually get a local eradication <unk> and that 's where we saw the malaria map shrinking <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 391.82 393.89 <NA> or if you go in kind of <unk>
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 394.89 398.69 <NA> for a period of time you 'll reduce the disease burden <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 398.5 404.97 <NA> but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 405.16 412.59 <NA> <unk> and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn 't pay attention now we 're on the upswing <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 412.52 414.78 <NA> bed net funding is up 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 414.78 422.38 <NA> there 's new drug discovery going on our foundation has backed a vaccine that 's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months <unk> 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 422.14 425.08 <NA> and that should save over two thirds of the lives
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 426.54 432.4 <NA> <unk> 're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn 't give us the road map 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 432.15 439.48 <NA> because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 439.02 449.66 <NA> the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories <unk> it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just seventy percent of the people to use the bed nets <unk> but ninety
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 450.97 457.74 <NA> <unk> we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 457.53 463.79 <NA> and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise 
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 463.39 471.65 <NA> we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together i 'm
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 471.64 474.93 <NA> quite optimistic that we will be able
BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 478.34 479.73 <NA> <unk> now let me turn

BillGates_2009 1 BillGates_2009 485.24 491.38 <NA> and this is how do you make a teacher great it seems like the kind of question that
