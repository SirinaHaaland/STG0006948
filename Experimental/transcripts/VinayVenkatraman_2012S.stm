VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 164.25 171.38 <NA> because that is something that 's happening not just in one street corner in mumbai <unk> it 's actually happening in all parts of the country <unk>

VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 220.72 225.02 <NA> deprived of enough resources <unk> but there 's an interesting paradigm there 's the traditional

VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 240.75 245.87 <NA> so we said what can we get out of this you know like what are the key values that we can get out of this 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 245.38 252.3 <NA> the main thing is a fix it locally culture <unk> which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn 't have to
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 252.13 254.88 <NA> go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 254.81 260.46 <NA> <unk> fixed <unk> it also affords us cheap fabrication which is fantastic so it means that you can do a lot more with it <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 260.03 274.47 <NA> and then the most important thing is it gives us large math for low cost so it means that you can actually embed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 276.27 288.19 <NA> <unk> what we call this is a silicon cottage industry it 's basically what was the system or the paradigm before the industrial revolution is now re happening in a whole new way in small digital shops
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 288.19 293.65 <NA> across the planet in most developing countries <unk> so we kind of
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 293.19 304.61 <NA> toyed around with this idea <unk> and we said what can we do with this can we make a little product or a service out of it so one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform we call it a lunch box basically one of the
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 305.08 307.19 <NA> <unk> that we studied was
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 306.7 310.31 <NA> schools in very remote parts of india <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 309.88 322.34 <NA> so there is this amazing concept called the one teacher school <unk> which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting <unk> it 's an informal school <unk> but it 's really about holistic education 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 321.91 329.73 <NA> the only thing that they don 't have is access to resources they don 't even have a textbook sometimes <unk> and they don 't even have a proper curriculum <unk> so we said
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 329.96 339.78 <NA> <unk> we do to empower this teacher to do more how to access the digital world <unk> instead of being the sole guardian of information be a facilitator to all this information <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 339.78 351.93 <NA> so we said what are the steps required to empower the teacher how do you make this teacher into a digital gateway and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 351.56 354.94 <NA> so we walked around <unk> we went and scavenged
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 355.46 360.26 <NA> markets and we tried to understand what can we pick up that will make this happen 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 360.02 368.05 <NA> so the thing that we got was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector that comes for about sixty dollars <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 368.04 373.85 <NA> we went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery <unk> and a bunch of small speakers <unk> so essentially the
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 373.67 374.87 <NA> mobile phone gives us a
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 375 378.68 <NA> connected multimedia platform it allows us to get online and
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 378.51 382.31 <NA> allows us to load up files of different formats and play them 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 382.31 388.86 <NA> the flashlight gives us this really intense bright <unk> l e d and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 388.62 392.63 <NA> and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 392.32 399.45 <NA> and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough believe me <unk> those little classrooms are really noisy <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 399.45 403.94 <NA> they are kids who scream at the top of their voices and you really have to get above that <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 403.45 404.91 <NA> and we took it back
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 405.07 413.88 <NA> this little tinkering setup of a mobile phone repair shop <unk> and then the magic happens we dismantle the whole thing we reassemble it in a new configuration <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 413.45 418.77 <NA> and we do this hardware mashup systematically training the guy how to do this <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 418.46 422.05 <NA> out comes this a little lunch box form factor
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 433.59 439.72 <NA> <unk> learned some important lessons <unk> and we went through many iterations one of the key issues was battery consumption and charging <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 439.23 446.6 <NA> luminosity was an issue when you have too much bright sunlight outside often the roofs are broken <unk> so you don 't have enough
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 446.39 450.11 <NA> darkness in the classroom to do these things we extended
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 450.61 453.47 <NA> <unk> we tested it many times over and the next version we came up with
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 453.3 458.26 <NA> was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy but most importantly connect
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 458.1 466.64 <NA> to a car battery <unk> because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there 's not enough electricity or erratic electricity 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 466.42 474.96 <NA> and the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a usb key because we realized that even though there was gprs and all that on paper at least in
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 476.18 487.2 <NA> <unk> it was much more efficient to send the data on a little usb key by surface mail <unk> it might take a few days to get there but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reliable quality <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 487.04 494.94 <NA> so we made this box and we tested it again and again and again and we 're going through multiple iterations to do these things <unk> but it 's not limited to just
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 494.48 501.66 <NA> education this kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas and i 'm going to tell you one more little story <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 501.32 504.94 <NA> it 's about this little device called a medi meter it 's basically a
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 504.8 507.76 <NA> a little health care screening tool that we developed 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 507.53 517.9 <NA> in india there is a context of these amazing people the health care workers called asha workers they are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system who live in the local community and are trained <unk>
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 517.8 523.1 <NA> <unk> with basic tools and basic concepts of health care <unk> and the main purpose is basically to
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 529.9 536.37 <NA> <unk> make recommendations of what kind of health care should they approach they are basically referral services essentially <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 536.37 540.33 <NA> but the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 540.15 549.81 <NA> that they are amazing at referring people to the nearest clinic or the public health care system <unk> but what happens at the public health care system is
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 551.03 555.04 <NA> <unk> incredibly long lines and too many people who overload the system
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 554.83 567.9 <NA> simply because there 's not enough doctors and and facilities for the population that 's being referred so everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention and there 's no priorities so we
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 567.62 575.05 <NA> said come on there 's got to be a better way of doing this for sure so we said what can we do with the asha worker that 'll allow this
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 575.04 581.27 <NA> <unk> asha worker to become an interesting filter but not just a filter a really well thought through referral system
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 581.06 586.08 <NA> that allows load balancing of the network <unk> and directs
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 585.92 591.7 <NA> patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 591.72 598.09 <NA> so the real key question was how do we empower this woman how do we empower her with simple tools
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 597.63 599.99 <NA> that 's not diagnostic but more screening
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 600.97 609.71 <NA> <unk> she at least knows how to advise the patients better and that 'll make such a huge difference on the system because the amount of waiting time
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 609.4 618.72 <NA> and the amount of distances that people need to travel often sometimes seven to fifteen kilometers sometimes by foot to get a simple health check done 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 618.72 625.05 <NA> is very very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 625.52 637.71 <NA> <unk> so if there was something that she could do that would be amazing so what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device i want to demo this actually because it 's a very simple process 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 637.28 639.63 <NA> bruno do you want to join us come along 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 645.77 647.85 <NA> so 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 647.72 652.56 <NA> what we 're going to do is that we 're going to measure a few basic parameters on you 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 652.52 654.97 <NA> including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 654.93 659.54 <NA> <unk> 's there in your blood <unk> so you 're going to put your thumb on top of this
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 682.27 685.13 <NA> so it 's taking a little reading from you 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 687.25 692.33 <NA> and then the pointer goes and points to three different options let 's see what happens here 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 693.4 695.16 <NA> beeps oh bruno you can go home
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 707.51 711.09 <NA> <unk> had pointed to the red spot <unk> we would have to rush you to a hospital <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 711.23 718.17 <NA> luckily not today <unk> and if it had pointed to the orange or the amber <unk> it basically meant you had to have 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 717.8 724.81 <NA> sort of more continuous care from the health care worker so that was a very simple three step screening process that could basically change the
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 736.26 746.11 <NA> <unk> just explain to you how this is done <unk> because that 's the more interesting part <unk> so essentially the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 745.74 747.37 <NA> to this guy
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 747.15 748.6 <NA> is
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 748.83 754.01 <NA> a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 755.2 761.18 <NA> <unk> some parts from a computer mouse basically something that you can scavenge for very low cost <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 761.44 765.71 <NA> and a few parts that have to be pre programmed basically this is a <unk>
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 766.74 771.17 <NA> with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 771.17 778.04 <NA> and that 's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 777.82 779.97 <NA> so we are right now
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 780.16 792.22 <NA> doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker <unk> we are going through some reference tests to compare it against professional equipment to see
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 792.04 797.2 <NA> if there 's a degree of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact in people 's lives <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 797.2 804.82 <NA> but most importantly <unk> what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up because there are over two hundred and fifty thousand asha workers on the
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 805.19 808.4 <NA> who are these amazing foot soldiers <unk> and if we can give
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 808.4 819.04 <NA> at least a fraction of them the access to these things <unk> it just changes the way the economics of public health care works <unk> and it changes the way systems actually function not just
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 818.7 825.08 <NA> on a systematic planning level planning level but also in a very grassroots <unk> bottom up level <unk> 
VinayVenkatraman_2012S 1 VinayVenkatraman_2012S 825 828 <NA> so that 's it <unk> and we hope to do this in a big way thank you
