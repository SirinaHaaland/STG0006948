SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 13.7 25.11 <NA> talk about the two ideas that at least based on my observations at khan academy are kind of the core or the key leverage points for for learning and it 's the idea of mastery and the idea
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 26.15 36.33 <NA> <unk> i saw this in the early days working with my cousins a lot of them were having trouble with math at first because they had all of these gaps accumulated in their in their learning and because of that at some point they got <unk>
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 36.23 41.98 <NA> <unk> to an algebra class and they might have been a little bit shaky on some of the pre algebra and because of that
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 52.62 58.66 <NA> <unk> those videos on youtube and i realized that people who were not my cousins were watching <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 58.68 67.55 <NA> and at first those comments were just simple thank yous i thought that was a pretty big deal i don 't know how much time you all spend on youtube
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 67.37 71.08 <NA> most of the comments are not thank you they 're a
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 70.77 79.79 <NA> little edgier than that but then the comments got a little more intense student after student saying that they had grown up not liking math
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 79.96 87.03 <NA> <unk> was getting difficult as they got into more advanced math topics by the time they got to algebra they had so many gaps in their knowledge they couldn 't engage with it
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 86.85 97.16 <NA> they thought they didn 't have the math gene <unk> but when they were a bit older they took a little agency and decided to engage they found resources like khan academy and they were able to fill in those gaps <unk>
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 97.06 104.7 <NA> <unk> and master those concepts <unk> and that reinforced their mindset that it wasn 't fixed that they actually were capable of of learning mathematics
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 104.96 115.11 <NA> <unk> and in a lot of ways this is how you would master a lot of things in life it 's the way you would learn a martial art in a martial art <unk> you would practice the white belt skills as long <unk>
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 115.01 125.05 <NA> <unk> as necessary <unk> and only when you 've mastered it you would move on to become a yellow belt it 's the way you learn a musical instrument <unk> you practice the basic piece over and over again and only when you 've mastered it
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 125.22 128.86 <NA> <unk> you go on to the more advanced one but what we point out
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 128.49 136.54 <NA> this is not the way a a traditional academic model is structured the type of academic model that most of us grew up in 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 136.34 143.75 <NA> in a traditional academic model we group students together usually by age and around middle school by age and perceived ability 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 143.75 147.08 <NA> and we shepherd them all together at the same pace <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 146.84 152.74 <NA> and what typically happens let 's say we 're in a middle school pre algebra class and the current unit is on exponents <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 152.28 154.88 <NA> the teacher will give a lecture on exponents
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 155.84 165.17 <NA> go home do some homework the next morning we 'll review the homework then another lecture homework lecture homework that will continue for about two or three weeks <unk> and then we get a test
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 164.68 174.84 <NA> on that test <unk> maybe i get a seventy five percent <unk> maybe you get a ninety percent maybe you get a ninety five percent <unk> and even though the test identified gaps in our knowledge i didn 't
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 175.76 183.94 <NA> <unk> percent of the material even the a student what was the five percent they didn 't know even though we 've identified the gaps <unk> the whole class will then move on to the next subject 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 183.76 194.13 <NA> probably a a more advanced subject that 's going to build on those gaps it might be logarithms or negative exponents and that process continues and you immediately start to realize how how <unk>
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 194.03 199.99 <NA> <unk> strange this is i didn 't know twenty five percent of the more foundational thing <unk> and now i 'm being pushed to the more advanced thing
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 200.34 206.68 <NA> <unk> this will continue for months years all the way until at some point i might be in an algebra class or trigonometry class
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 206.19 214.6 <NA> and i hit a wall and it 's not because algebra is fundamentally difficult or because the student isn 't bright it
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 214.17 220.34 <NA> 's because i 'm seeing an equation and they 're dealing with exponents and that thirty percent that i didn 't know is showing up <unk>
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 222.02 224.72 <NA> and then i start to disengage to
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 226.42 232.55 <NA> <unk> how absurd that is imagine if we did other things in our life that way say home building 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 236.35 242.87 <NA> so we bring in the contractor and say we were told we have two weeks to build a foundation 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 242.44 244.31 <NA> do what you can 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 246.46 254.58 <NA> laughter so they do what they can maybe it rains maybe some of the supplies don 't show up and two weeks later the inspector comes
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 254.93 262.53 <NA> <unk> around says ok the concrete is still wet right over there that part 's not quite up to code i 'll give it an eighty percent you
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 262.76 265.71 <NA> say great that 's a c let 's build the first floor 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 266.21 267.79 <NA> same thing <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 267.55 277.84 <NA> we have two weeks do what you can inspector shows up it 's a seventy five percent great that 's a d plus second floor third floor and all of a sudden while you 're building the third floor <unk> the whole structure collapses <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 280.17 288.55 <NA> <unk> have in education or that a lot of folks have you might say maybe we had a bad contractor or maybe we needed better inspection or more frequent inspection <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 288.55 296.44 <NA> but what was really broken was the process we were artificially constraining how long we had to something pretty much ensuring a variable outcome
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 296.01 304.61 <NA> and we took the trouble of inspecting and identifying those gaps <unk> but then we built right on top of it <unk> so the idea of mastery learning is to do the exact opposite
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 304.93 314.06 <NA> <unk> instead of artificially constraining fixing when and how long you work on something pretty much ensuring that variable outcome the a b c d f
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 313.57 323.42 <NA> do it the other way around <unk> what 's variable is when and how long a student actually has to work on something <unk> and what 's fixed is that they actually master the material <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 323.02 328.29 <NA> and it 's important to realize that not only will this make the student learn their exponents better
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 329.99 338.25 <NA> <unk> the right mindset muscles it makes them realize that if you got twenty percent wrong on something it doesn 't mean that you have a c branded in your dna somehow 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 338.25 345.36 <NA> it means that you should just keep working on it you should have grit you should have perseverance <unk> you should take agency over your learning <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 345.44 354.94 <NA> now a lot of skeptics might say well hey this is all great philosophically this whole idea of mastery based learning and its connection to mindset students taking agency over their learning
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 354.98 365.09 <NA> makes a lot of sense but it seems impractical to actually do it every student would be on their own track it would have to be personalized you 'd have to have private tutors
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 365.09 372.38 <NA> and worksheets for every student and these aren 't new ideas there were experiments in winnetka illinois one hundred years ago <unk> where they did mastery based learning
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 379.99 381.2 <NA> <unk> on demand assessments <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 381.01 390.89 <NA> but now today it 's no longer impractical we have the tools to do it students see an explanation at their own time and pace <unk> there 's on demand video for that they need practice <unk> they need <unk>
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 390.79 396.26 <NA> <unk> feedback <unk> there 's adaptive exercises readily available for students <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 404.75 411.93 <NA> <unk> perseverance they 're taking agency over their learning and all sorts of beautiful things can start to happen in the actual classroom <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 411.59 420.27 <NA> instead of it being focused on the lecture students can interact with each other they can get deeper mastery over the material <unk> they can go into simulations socratic dialogue
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 420.08 429.94 <NA> to appreciate what we 're talking about and the the tragedy of of lost potential here i 'd like to give a little bit of a a thought experiment
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 430.53 439.1 <NA> if we were to go four hundred years into the past to western europe which even then was one of the more literate parts of of the planet 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 439.1 443.08 <NA> you would see that about fifteen percent of the population knew how to read <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 443.1 452.27 <NA> and i suspect that if you asked someone who did know how to read say a member of the clergy what percentage of the population do you think is even capable of reading
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 454.78 459.05 <NA> <unk> education system <unk> maybe twenty or thirty percent 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 458.95 467.84 <NA> but if you fast forward to today we know that that prediction would have been wildly pessimistic that pretty close to one hundred percent of the population is capable of reading <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 467.74 469.56 <NA> but if i were to ask you
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 469.2 470.93 <NA> a similar question 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 471.01 479.97 <NA> what percentage of the population do you think is capable of truly mastering calculus or understanding organic
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 479.96 489.54 <NA> <unk> chemistry or being able to contribute to to cancer research a lot of you might say well with a great education system <unk> maybe twenty thirty percent 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 489.32 499.56 <NA> but what if that estimate is just based on your own experience in a non mastery framework your own experience with yourself or observing your peers where you 're being pushed at this set pace <unk>
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 499.46 504.94 <NA> <unk> through classes accumulating all these gaps even when you got that ninety five percent what was that five percent you missed
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 504.95 514.12 <NA> and it keeps accumulating you get to an advanced class all of a sudden you hit a wall and say i 'm not meant to be a cancer researcher not meant to be a physicist not meant to be a mathematician 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 513.78 520.36 <NA> i suspect that that actually is the case but if you were allowed to be operating in a mastery framework 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 520.35 528.68 <NA> if you were allowed to really take agency over your learning and when you get something wrong embrace it view that failure as a moment of learning that number
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 529.93 536.99 <NA> <unk> that could really master calculus or or understand organic chemistry is actually a lot closer to one hundred percent <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 537.13 540.74 <NA> and this isn 't even just a nice to have 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 540.55 549.69 <NA> i think it 's a social imperative we 're exiting what you could call the industrial age and we 're going into this
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 551.63 557.74 <NA> <unk> it 's clear that some things are happening in the industrial age society was a pyramid <unk> at the base of the pyramid <unk>
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 559.48 561.09 <NA> you needed human labor 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 560.6 573.66 <NA> in the middle of the pyramid you had an information processing <unk> a bureaucracy class and at the top of the pyramid you had your your owners of capital and and your entrepreneurs and and your creative class <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 573.47 578.98 <NA> but we know what 's happening already as we go into this information revolution the bottom of that pyramid
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 579.96 584.68 <NA> <unk> take over even that middle tier <unk> information processing that 's what computers are good at 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 584.25 590.63 <NA> so as a society we have a question all this new productivity is happening because of this technology but who participates in it 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 590.63 599.53 <NA> is it just going to be that very top of the pyramid in which case what does everyone else do how do they operate or do we do something that 's more aspirational 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 599.13 604.73 <NA> do we actually attempt to invert the pyramid <unk> where you have a large creative class
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 605.07 610.79 <NA> almost everyone can participate as an entrepreneur an artist as a researcher <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 610.42 617.46 <NA> and i don 't think that this is utopian <unk> i really think that this is all based on the idea that if we let people tap into their potential
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 617.07 624.47 <NA> by mastering concepts <unk> by being able to exercise agency over their learning that they can get there 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 624.22 629.43 <NA> and when you think of it as just a a citizen of the world it 's pretty exciting
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 630.01 636.18 <NA> think about the type of equity we can we have and the rate at which civilization could even progress 
SalmanKhan_2015P 1 SalmanKhan_2015P 635.9 642.61 <NA> and so i 'm pretty optimistic about it i think it 's going to be a a pretty exciting time to be alive <unk> thank you
