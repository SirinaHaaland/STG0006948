RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 13.9 19.1 <NA> <unk> i want to talk about understanding and the nature of understanding and what
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 18.76 25.08 <NA> the essence of understanding is because understanding is something we aim for everyone
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 25 27.51 <NA> we want to understand things 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 27.2 35.67 <NA> my claim is that understanding has to do with the ability to change your perspective <unk> if you don 't have that you don 't have understanding <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 35.54 39.7 <NA> so that is my claim <unk> and i want to focus on mathematics 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 39.7 49.89 <NA> many of us think of mathematics as addition subtraction multiplication <unk> division fractions percent <unk> geometry algebra all that stuff 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 50.61 56.98 <NA> <unk> i want to talk about the essence of mathematics as well <unk> and my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 56.49 65.41 <NA> behind me you see a beautiful pattern <unk> and this pattern actually emerges just from drawing circles in a very particular way <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 65.22 70.31 <NA> so my day to day definition of mathematics that i use every day
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 70.1 74.81 <NA> is the following <unk> first of all <unk> it 's about finding patterns
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 76.96 83.81 <NA> <unk> i mean a connection a structure some regularity some rules that govern what we see 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 83.56 89.06 <NA> second of all i think it is about representing these patterns with a language 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 88.78 94.46 <NA> we make up language if we don 't have it and in mathematics this is essential 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 94.45 100.05 <NA> it 's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 100.58 110.22 <NA> <unk> we 're going to do that very soon <unk> and finally <unk> it 's about doing cool stuff mathematics enables us to do so many things <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 110.06 118.2 <NA> so let 's have a look at these patterns <unk> if you want to tie a tie knot there are patterns tie knots have names <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 117.86 120.79 <NA> and you can also do the mathematics of tie knots this is

RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 134.97 143.77 <NA> this is a mathematics book about tying shoelaces at the university level because there are patterns in shoelaces you can do it in so many different ways <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 143.31 147.19 <NA> we can analyze it <unk> we can make up languages for it

RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 155.17 162.96 <NA> <unk> he invented a language for patterns in nature when we throw something up in the air it falls down why 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 162.96 167.54 <NA> we 're not sure but we can represent this with mathematics in a pattern <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 167.71 171.21 <NA> this is also a pattern this is also
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 171.04 178.89 <NA> an invented language can you guess for what it is actually a notation system for dancing for tap dancing
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 179.87 187.14 <NA> <unk> enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff to do new things <unk> because he has represented it
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 186.68 192.33 <NA> i want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 192.05 195.6 <NA> here it says the word mathematics 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 195.29 202.92 <NA> but actually they 're just dots right <unk> so how in the world can these dots represent the word <unk> well they do 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 202.79 204.28 <NA> they represent the word
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 205.01 211.21 <NA> and these symbols also represent that word and this we can listen to it sounds like this 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 212.37 217.72 <NA> somehow these sounds represent the word and the concept how does this happen
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 217.72 221.77 <NA> there 's something amazing going on about representing stuff <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 221.31 222.88 <NA> so
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 222.45 224.21 <NA> i want to talk about
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 225.97 230.6 <NA> <unk> that magic that happens when we actually represent something here you see just
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 230.6 238.67 <NA> lines with different widths <unk> they stand for numbers for a particular book <unk> and i can actually recommend this book it 's a very nice book just
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 238.51 239.96 <NA> trust me <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 240.88 250.02 <NA> ok <unk> so let 's just do an experiment just to play around with some straight lines <unk> this is a straight line let 's make another one <unk> so every time we move we move
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 250 255.87 <NA> one down and one across and we we draw a new straight line right <unk> we do this over and over and over 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 255.8 266.97 <NA> and we look for patterns <unk> so this pattern emerges <unk> and it 's a rather nice pattern <unk> it looks like a curve right <unk> just from drawing simple straight lines 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 266.72 274.9 <NA> now i can change my perspective a little bit i can rotate it have a look at the curve what does it look like is it a part of a
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 275.61 280.15 <NA> <unk> it 's actually not a part of a circle <unk> so i have to continue my investigation and look for
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 279.95 284.65 <NA> the true pattern <unk> perhaps if i copy it and make some art
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 285.09 293.26 <NA> well no perhaps i should extend the lines like this and look for the pattern there let 's make more lines we do this 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 292.8 297.52 <NA> and then let 's zoom out and change our perspective again <unk>
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 297.18 304.31 <NA> then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola this is
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 304.69 309.26 <NA> <unk> represented by a simple equation and it 's a beautiful pattern <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 308.95 319.97 <NA> so this is the stuff that we do we find patterns <unk> and we represent them and i think this is a nice day to day definition but today i want to go a little bit deeper and think about
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 319.84 328.86 <NA> what the nature of of this is what makes it possible <unk> there 's one thing that 's a little bit deeper and that has to do with the ability to change your perspective
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 329.96 338.7 <NA> <unk> and i claim that when you change your perspective <unk> and if you take another point of view <unk> you learn something new about what you are
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 338.21 347.76 <NA> watching or looking at or hearing <unk> and i think this is a really important thing that we do all the time <unk> so let 's just
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 347.69 350.11 <NA> look at this simple equation
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 352.29 362.72 <NA> <unk> this is a very nice pattern <unk> and it 's true because five + five = two five etc <unk> we 've seen this over and over and we represent it like this <unk> but think about it this is an equation 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 362.72 365.54 <NA> it says that something is equal to something else <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 365.09 373.88 <NA> and that 's two different perspectives one perspective is it 's a sum <unk> it 's something you plus together on the other hand it 's a multiplication <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 373.88 376.84 <NA> and those are two different perspectives 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 376.62 379.94 <NA> and i would go as far as to say that every equation
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 379.96 384.8 <NA> <unk> is like this <unk> every mathematical equation where you use that equality sign
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 384.63 386.57 <NA> is actually a metaphor <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 386.32 394.63 <NA> it 's an analogy between two things you 're just viewing something and taking two different points of view <unk> and you 're expressing that in a language 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 394.63 396.39 <NA> have a look at this equation <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 396.21 398.67 <NA> this is one of the most beautiful equations <unk>
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 398.46 399.63 <NA> it simply says
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 404.48 407.64 <NA> <unk> this thing on the left hand side is minus one and the other one is 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 407.18 415.08 <NA> and that i think is one of the essential parts of mathematics you take different points of view <unk> so let 's just play around <unk> let 's take a number
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 415.08 419.38 <NA> <unk> we know four thirds we know what four thirds is it 's one point three three three 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 419.15 424.87 <NA> but we have to have those three dots <unk> otherwise it 's not exactly four thirds but this is only in base
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 425.67 432.07 <NA> <unk> you know the number system we use ten digits if we change that around and only use two digits <unk> that 's called the binary system <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 431.76 437.56 <NA> it 's written like this <unk> so we 're now talking about the number the number is <unk> four thirds
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 437.43 446.6 <NA> we can write it like this <unk> and we can change the base change the number of digits and we can write it differently <unk> so these are all representations
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 446.36 454.94 <NA> of the same number <unk> we can even write it simply like one point three or one point six it all depends on how many digits you have or
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 455.04 467.09 <NA> perhaps we just simplify and write it like this <unk> i like this one because this says four divided by three and this number expresses a relation between two numbers you have four on the one hand and three on the other <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 466.66 474.24 <NA> and you can visualize this in many ways what i 'm doing now is viewing that number from different perspectives i 'm playing around i
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 474.24 479.7 <NA> 'm playing around with how we view something and i 'm doing it very deliberately <unk> we can take a grid
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 479.99 487.42 <NA> <unk> if it 's four across and three up this line equals five <unk> always <unk> it has to be like this <unk> this is a beautiful pattern <unk>

RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 489 499.93 <NA> and this rectangle which is four x three you 've seen a lot of times <unk> this is your average computer screen eight hundred x six hundred or one thousand six hundred x one thousand two hundred is a television
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 500.25 501.67 <NA> <unk> or a computer screen <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 501.33 507.65 <NA> so these are all nice representations but i want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 507.65 514.87 <NA> here you see two circles <unk> i 'm going to rotate them like this <unk> observe the upper left one it goes a little bit faster right <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 514.56 519.44 <NA> you can see this it actually goes exactly four thirds as fast <unk>
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 519.44 529.22 <NA> that means that when it goes around four times the other one goes around three times <unk> now let 's make two lines and draw this dot where the lines meet <unk> we get this dot dancing around
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 529.99 532.31 <NA> <unk> dot comes from that number <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 532.36 540.78 <NA> right <unk> now we should trace it let 's trace it and see what happens <unk> this is what mathematics is all about it 's about seeing what happens <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 540.78 546.39 <NA> and this emerges from four thirds i like to say that this is the image of

RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 725.92 739.07 <NA> let 's do a simple example again this is four and three this is four triangles <unk> so this is also four thirds in a way <unk> let 's just join them together <unk> now we 're going to play a game we 're going to fold it up into a three dimensional structure i

RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 887.09 895.21 <NA> so all of these are different perspectives and this is the best one we can go into the water <unk> we can see the water from the inside <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 895.21 900.41 <NA> and you know what this is absolutely essential in mathematics and computer science if you 're able to
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 900.22 904.97 <NA> view a structure from the inside <unk> then you really learn something about it
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 904.87 911.48 <NA> <unk> it that 's somehow the essence of something <unk> so when we do this and we 've taken this journey
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 911.05 919.7 <NA> into the ocean we use our imagination <unk> and i think this is one level deeper <unk> and it 's actually a requirement for
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 919.21 921.56 <NA> changing your perspective
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 921.22 929.97 <NA> <unk> we can do a little game you can imagine that you 're sitting there you can imagine that you 're up here <unk> and that you 're sitting here you can view yourselves from the outside

RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 938.54 946.11 <NA> that requires imagination mathematics and computer science are the most imaginative art forms ever <unk> 
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 946.34 950.11 <NA> and this thing about changing perspectives should sound a little bit familiar

RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 974.67 979.97 <NA> and this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science and there 's a really deep
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 979.96 982.52 <NA> <unk> connection between empathy
RogerAntonsen_2015X 1 RogerAntonsen_2015X 982.33 988.52 <NA> and these sciences <unk> so my conclusion is the following
