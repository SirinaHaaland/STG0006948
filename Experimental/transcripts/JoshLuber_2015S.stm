JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 84.14 89.42 <NA> and that 's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale

JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 212.84 215.68 <NA> that i didn 't know the first thing about data <unk> 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 215.55 218.71 <NA> but i learned <unk> because i had to 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 218.31 225.73 <NA> and i liked it so i thought i wonder if i could get ahold of some sneaker data just to play with for my own amusement 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 225.51 229.91 <NA> the goal was to develop a price guide a real data driven view of the market

JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 246.37 254.61 <NA> and the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry <unk> and here 's the best part
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 256.12 258.99 <NA> have sneaker portfolios laughter
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 260.18 268.47 <NA> sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time compare it to others and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account <unk> 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 268.46 273.76 <NA> so sneakerhead dan builds his collection and identifies which three hundred and fifty two are his 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 273.76 278.7 <NA> he can see it 's worth one hundred and three thousand dollars frankly a modest collection

JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 280.13 287.68 <NA> he can see gain loss by shoe here he 's made over six hundred dollars on one pair i have one of those 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 290.19 299.66 <NA> so an unregulated one point two billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online and has spawned fundamental financial services for
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 301.15 308.72 <NA> <unk> at some point i asked myself what 's really going on in the market <unk> and two comparisons started to emerge are sneakers more like stocks
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 308.72 316.04 <NA> or drugs in fact one guy emailed to say he thought his 15 year old son
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 315.58 321.05 <NA> was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 322.24 329.85 <NA> and now they use the data to do it together <unk> and that 's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists and
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 329.87 337.56 <NA> <unk> don 't just mean the kid selling sneakers <unk> instead of drugs how about all kids you have to be eighteen to play the stock market <unk> 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 337.52 344.19 <NA> i sold chewing gum in sixth grade <unk> blow pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school

JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 358.2 366.16 <NA> but also unregulated which is why the story you 're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 366.18 375.08 <NA> and while that definitely happens and is tragic <unk> it 's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe in fact it 's a very
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 375 378.14 <NA> small piece of a much bigger and better story 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 378.1 387.51 <NA> so sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor

JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 415.13 422.7 <NA> that means that sneakerheads made three hundred and eighty million dollars selling nikes last year <unk>

JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 439.35 447.22 <NA> that means that nike 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 447.24 449.35 <NA> that 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 452.55 454.43 <NA> how is that even possible
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 455.8 462.26 <NA> the sneaker market is just supply and demand <unk> but nike 's gotten very good at using supply
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 461.86 467.45 <NA> limited sneakers and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 466.99 469.25 <NA> so it 's really just supply
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 469.02 473.18 <NA> <unk> sneakerheads joke that as long as it 's limited and nike they 'll buy it

JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 490.51 496.83 <NA> and in the process it provided tens of thousands of people with life long passions <unk> myself included 
JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 497.12 499.9 <NA> if nike wanted to kill the resell market they could do so

JoshLuber_2015S 1 JoshLuber_2015S 530.5 535.4 <NA> it 's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before this isn 't in any textbook
