AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 12.79 14.45 <NA> <unk> i 've got a confession <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 14.05 17.3 <NA> i love looking through people 's garbage
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 17.29 24.96 <NA> <unk> now it 's not some creepy thing <unk> i 'm usually just looking for old electronics stuff i can take to my workshop and hack <unk> <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 28.4 39.01 <NA> <unk> each one 's got three different motors <unk> so now you can build things that move <unk> there 's switches so you can turn things on and off there 's even a freaking laser so you can make a cool robot
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 38.83 42.33 <NA> into an awesome robot 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 42.23 50.08 <NA> now i 've built a lot of stuff out of garbage <unk> and some of these things have even been kind of useful <unk> but here 's the thing for
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 50.88 59.11 <NA> <unk> is just a chance to play to be creative and build things to amuse myself this is what i love doing <unk> so i just made it part of my day job <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 58.71 68.8 <NA> i lead a <unk> university based biological research lab where we value curiosity and exploration above all else we aren 't focused on any particular problem <unk> and we 're not <unk>
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 68.7 77.42 <NA> <unk> trying to solve any particular disease this is just a place where people can come and ask fascinating questions and find answers <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 79.99 87.27 <NA> <unk> i challenge people to build the equipment they need out of the garbage i find it 's a great way to foster creativity <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 87.03 93.42 <NA> and what happened was that artists and scientists from around the world started coming to my lab <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 93.42 100.94 <NA> and it 's not just because we value unconventional ideas it 's because we test and validate them with scientific rigor <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 101.11 102.71 <NA> so
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 102.28 103.65 <NA> one day i was
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 104.99 107.55 <NA> <unk> it apart and i had this sudden idea 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 107.15 117.21 <NA> could i treat biology like hardware <unk> could i dismantle a biological system mix and match the parts and then put it back together in some new and creative way
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 117.21 122.01 <NA> my lab started working on this and i want to show you the result 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 123.17 126.13 <NA> can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 129.93 139.87 <NA> <unk> now <unk> i actually want you to notice as well that this is a lot redder than most apples <unk> and that 's because we grew human cells into it we took
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 139.64 146.05 <NA> a totally innocent macintosh apple removed all the apple cells and dna
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 146.04 154.94 <NA> and then implanted human cells and what we 're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold this is the stuff that gives plants their
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 154.87 160.88 <NA> <unk> shape and texture <unk> and these little holes that you can see this is where all the apple cells used to be 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 160.75 170.3 <NA> so then we come along we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue <unk> what happens is these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 169.9 172.61 <NA> as weird as this is 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 172.24 174.99 <NA> it 's actually really reminiscent of how our own
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 179.42 186.87 <NA> <unk> you can implant these scaffolds into the body and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 186.83 195.3 <NA> this is the point when people started asking me andrew can you make body parts out of apples 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 195.29 204.91 <NA> and i 'm like you 've come to the right place i actually brought this up with my wife she 's a musical instrument maker <unk> and she does a lot of wood
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 204.84 208.57 <NA> <unk> carving for a living so i asked her 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 208.35 215.9 <NA> could you like <unk> literally carve some ears out of an apple for us and she did <unk> so
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 215.67 222.34 <NA> i took her ears to the lab we then started preparing them <unk> yeah i know laughter
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 223.47 227.05 <NA> it 's a good lab man 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 228.12 229.88 <NA> and then we grew cells on them
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 230.53 236.34 <NA> and this is the result <unk> listen my lab is not in the
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 237.69 239.57 <NA> business <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 239.26 244.7 <NA> people have actually been working on this for decades here 's the issue <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 244.24 253.71 <NA> commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic <unk> because they 're sourced from proprietary products animals or cadavers
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 258.71 260.61 <NA> we used an apple
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 260.41 262.53 <NA> and it cost pennies
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 262.37 266.9 <NA> <unk> what 's also really cool here is it 's not that hard to make these things 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 266.9 274.59 <NA> the equipment you need can be built from garbage and the key processing step only requires soap and water <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 274.31 279.09 <NA> so what we did was put all the instructions online as open source 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 278.87 279.88 <NA> and then we
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 279.87 290.29 <NA> <unk> founded a mission driven company <unk> and we 're developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home what i 'm really curious <unk>
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 290.19 297.5 <NA> <unk> about is if one day it will be possible to repair rebuild and augment our own bodies
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 305.28 308.84 <NA> <unk> they 're tasty and they make your pee smell funny 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 308.86 317.46 <NA> now <unk> i was in my kitchen <unk> and i was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus what you can see are all these tiny little vessels 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 317.46 322.64 <NA> and when we image them in the lab you can see how the cellulose forms these structures 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 322.33 327.26 <NA> this image reminds me of two things our blood vessels
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 327.1 329.97 <NA> and the structure and organization of our nerves
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 330.1 333.48 <NA> and spinal cord <unk> so here 's the question 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 333.32 342.15 <NA> can we grow axons and neurons down these channels because if we can then maybe we can use asparagus
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 342.32 349.71 <NA> to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves or maybe even a spinal cord <unk>
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 350.67 357.88 <NA> <unk> don 't get me wrong this is exceptionally challenging and really hard work to do and we are not the only ones working on this 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 357.88 361.36 <NA> but we are the only ones using asparagus laughter
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 363.54 371.89 <NA> right now we 've got really promising pilot data and we 're working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeons to find out what 's actually possible 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 372.24 374.96 <NA> so listen all of the work i 've shown
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 375.25 385.14 <NA> <unk> the stuff that i 've built that 's all around me on this stage and the other projects my lab is involved in are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 385.14 386.55 <NA> play
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 386.33 387.71 <NA> play
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 387.37 395.24 <NA> is a key part of my scientific practice it 's how i train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 395.24 400.11 <NA> and to decide to make human apple ears so the next time
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 407.72 410.16 <NA> <unk> i want you to think of me <unk> 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 409.7 418.47 <NA> because i want it seriously <unk> please find any way to get in touch with me <unk> and let 's see what we can build 
AndrewPelling_2016U 1 AndrewPelling_2016U 418.04 419.05 <NA> thank you
