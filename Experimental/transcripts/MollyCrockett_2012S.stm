MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 29.78 31.02 <NA> <unk> sandwich 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 31.43 40.23 <NA> that 's right according to scientists a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions how do i know 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 40.19 43.14 <NA> i 'm the scientist who did the study 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 43.79 50.26 <NA> a few years ago my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people 's decisions
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 50.22 56.63 <NA> <unk> in social situations specifically we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 56.63 64.19 <NA> when they 're treated unfairly <unk> so we did an experiment we manipulated people 's serotonin levels by giving them this really <unk>
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 65.81 74.96 <NA> artificial lemon flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain this is the amino acid tryptophan <unk>
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 75.88 83.06 <NA> <unk> so what we found was when tryptophan was low people were more likely to take revenge when they 're treated unfairly 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 83.68 90.03 <NA> that 's the study we did and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 104.9 112.83 <NA> <unk> thing myself when these came out because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate we gave people this horrible tasting drink
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 112.6 121.89 <NA> that affected their tryptophan levels <unk> but it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 121.97 124.96 <NA> and of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 126 133.36 <NA> <unk> that 's sure to grab people 's attention <unk> so there you have it the evolution of a headline 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 133.89 142.19 <NA> when this happened a part of me thought well <unk> what 's the big deal <unk> so the media oversimplified a few things but in the end 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 142.19 144.52 <NA> it 's just a news story <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 144.15 147.55 <NA> and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 147.54 154.97 <NA> but the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time <unk> and it affects not just the stories you read in the news
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 155.07 162.59 <NA> but also the products you see on the shelves when the headlines rolled <unk> what happened was the marketers came calling 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 162.73 169.28 <NA> would i be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood boosting bottled water 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 169.24 176 <NA> or would i go on television to demonstrate in front of a live audience that comfort foods really do make you feel better 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 176.23 178.88 <NA> i think these folks meant well but
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 178.45 179.91 <NA> had i taken them up on
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 179.99 186.15 <NA> <unk> offers i would have been going beyond the science and good scientists are careful not to do this 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 185.81 193.11 <NA> but nevertheless neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing here 's one example neuro drinks 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 192.65 200.02 <NA> a line of products <unk> including nuero bliss here <unk> which according to its label helps reduce stress enhances
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 200.76 208.96 <NA> <unk> provides focused concentration <unk> and promotes a positive outlook i have to say this sounds awesome 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 209.13 213.1 <NA> laughter i could totally have used this ten minutes ago
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 213.45 220.72 <NA> <unk> so when this came up in my local shop naturally i was curious about some of the research backing these claims 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 220.23 225.26 <NA> so i went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 227.05 236.48 <NA> <unk> but i didn 't find any <unk> trial or no trial these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 236.41 241.79 <NA> and it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 241.72 249.75 <NA> a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article for half the people the article included a brain
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 250.43 254.46 <NA> <unk> and for the other half it was the same article but it didn 't have a brain image
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 254.75 261.36 <NA> at the end you see where this is going people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 261.68 266.55 <NA> so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 266.21 272.47 <NA> and this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 272.47 276.75 <NA> so the take home message here is do you want to sell it 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 276.35 278.16 <NA> put a brain on it 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 280.01 289.33 <NA> let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades <unk> and we 're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 288.87 299.44 <NA> <unk> like just a couple of weeks ago neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 298.95 300.88 <NA> really cool stuff
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 300.78 304.97 <NA> but the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 305.43 312.15 <NA> and some overblown unproven claims <unk> so what i 'm going to do is show you how to spot
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 312.15 317.34 <NA> a couple of classic moves <unk> dead giveaways really for what 's variously been called
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 330.11 333.72 <NA> <unk> 's thoughts and emotions here 's a study
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 333.49 342.51 <NA> published by a team of researchers as an op ed in the new york times <unk> the headline you love your iphone <unk> literally 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 342.23 346.59 <NA> it quickly became the most emailed article on the site 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 346.79 354.97 <NA> so how 'd they figure this out they put sixteen people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iphones
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 355.62 365.05 <NA> the brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula <unk> a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 365.13 372.85 <NA> so they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula this meant the subjects loved their iphones <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 372.96 379.97 <NA> now there 's just one problem with this line of reasoning <unk> and that 's that the insula does a lot sure
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 379.93 389.59 <NA> <unk> it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion <unk> but it 's also involved in tons of other processes like memory <unk> language attention <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 389.59 393.29 <NA> even anger <unk> disgust and pain <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 393.01 399.89 <NA> so based on the same logic <unk> i could equally conclude you hate your iphone <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 400.09 404.97 <NA> the point here is when you see activation in the insula you can 't just pick and choose
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 405.1 408.37 <NA> your favorite explanation from off this list <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 408.37 421.02 <NA> and it 's a really long list <unk> my colleagues tal yarkoni and russ poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 420.77 425.08 <NA> so chances are really really good that your insula is going off right now
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 425.94 429.82 <NA> <unk> but i won 't kid myself to think this means you love me
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 430.44 433.87 <NA> <unk> so speaking of love and the brain 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 433.77 440.75 <NA> there 's a researcher <unk> known to some as dr love who claims that scientists have found
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 440.59 450.13 <NA> the glue that holds society together the source of love and prosperity this time it 's not a cheese sandwich 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 450.58 455.27 <NA> <unk> it 's a hormone called oxytocin you 've probably heard of it
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 455.56 463.38 <NA> so dr love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people 's oxytocin this increases their trust 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 463.38 465.77 <NA> empathy and cooperation <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 465.76 474.93 <NA> so he 's calling oxytocin the moral molecule now these studies are scientifically valid <unk> and they 've been replicated <unk> but they 're not the
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 477.02 483.87 <NA> <unk> other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy it increases gloating 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 483.86 487.99 <NA> oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 487.57 494.7 <NA> at the expense of other groups and in some cases oxytocin can even decrease cooperation <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 494.63 499.87 <NA> so based on these studies <unk> i could say oxytocin is an immoral
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 509.34 515.86 <NA> <unk> all over the headlines we see it in supermarkets on book covers what about the clinic 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 516.15 524.65 <NA> spect imaging is a <unk> brain scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 524.55 529.91 <NA> for the bargain price of a few thousand dollars there are clinics
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 529.89 534.98 <NA> in the u s that will give you one of these spect scans
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 534.52 543.29 <NA> and use the image to help diagnose your problems these scans the clinics say can help prevent alzheimer 's disease <unk>

MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 565.13 574.11 <NA> <unk> the broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can 't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan <unk> 
MollyCrockett_2012S 1 MollyCrockett_2012S 574.04 579.97 <NA> but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date <unk> many of them children
