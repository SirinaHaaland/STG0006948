NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 11.98 13.25 <NA> <unk> when we park in a big
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 13.08 18.8 <NA> parking lot how do we remember where we parked our car here 's the problem facing homer <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 19.09 25.05 <NA> and we 're going to try to understand what 's happening in his brain <unk> so we 'll start with the hippocampus shown
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 26.06 36.85 <NA> <unk> which is the organ of memory if you have damage there like in alzheimer 's you can 't remember things including where you parked your car it 's named after latin for seahorse which it resembles and like the rest of the brain <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 36.85 41.68 <NA> it 's made of neurons so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 41.45 54.79 <NA> and the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other the hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells which are very densely interconnected <unk> and scientists have begun to
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 54.72 60.11 <NA> <unk> understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 59.93 65.44 <NA> rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 64.98 74.93 <NA> so we 're going to imagine we 're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of of this rat here <unk> and when it fires a little spike of electricity there 's going to be a red dot and a
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 77.08 83.99 <NA> <unk> so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 83.56 87.92 <NA> and it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 87.88 93.54 <NA> so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal 's location <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 93.33 101.61 <NA> and if we record from lots of different neurons we 'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment like in this square box shown here <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 101.61 104.97 <NA> so together they form a map for the rest of the brain
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 105.07 109.77 <NA> telling the brain continually where am i now within my environment 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 109.43 117.07 <NA> place cells are also being recorded in humans so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 117.07 129.85 <NA> and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town <unk> and place cells in their hippocampi would fire <unk> become active start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 129.9 137.83 <NA> so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment <unk> well these two cells here
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 137.34 141.32 <NA> show us that the the boundaries of the environment are particularly important <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 141.32 150.02 <NA> so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of of the box that their rat 's in and when you expand the box the firing location
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 151 164.36 <NA> <unk> the one below likes to fire whenever there 's a wall close by to the south <unk> and if you put another wall inside the box then the cell fires in both place wherever there 's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 164.41 167.36 <NA> <unk> so this predicts that
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 166.96 179.97 <NA> sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you extended buildings and so on is particularly important for the hippocampus <unk> and indeed on the inputs to the hippocampus cells are found which project into the hippocampus <unk> which do respond
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 180.13 184.06 <NA> exactly to detecting boundaries or edges
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 183.88 194.17 <NA> at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it 's exploring around so the cell on the left you can see it fires whenever the animal gets near to
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 194.12 204.7 <NA> <unk> a wall or a boundary to the east whether it 's the edge or the the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table which the animals are running around
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 204.93 220.09 <NA> <unk> and the cell on the right there fires whenever there 's a boundary to the south whether it 's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart so that 's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it 's exploring around we can also test
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 219.84 224.72 <NA> where we think objects are like this goal flag in simple environments or
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 225.7 233 <NA> <unk> your car would be <unk> so we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 232.51 240.12 <NA> and then if we put them back in the environment generally they 're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 239.88 245.37 <NA> but on some trials we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 245.37 253.58 <NA> in that case we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 253.18 254.55 <NA> and what you see
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 254.75 258.72 <NA> <unk> example if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 258.55 268.83 <NA> and then if you ask people where it was but you 've made the environment bigger where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out it 's as <unk>
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 268.73 279.97 <NA> <unk> if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across across all of your place cells at that location and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 279.72 287.06 <NA> <unk> match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern that guides you back to the location that you want to remember <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 287.06 290.15 <NA> but we also know where we are through movement <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 289.94 304.12 <NA> so if we take some outbound path perhaps we park and we wander off we know because our own movements which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back and place cells also get this kind of path integration input
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 303.66 304.97 <NA> from a kind of cell
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 304.99 306.68 <NA> <unk> called a grid cell 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 306.61 315.17 <NA> now grid cells are found again on the inputs to the hippocampus <unk> and they 're a bit like place cells <unk> but now as the rat explores around 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 314.89 319.28 <NA> each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 319.69 324.95 <NA> which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 325.96 329.97 <NA> and if you record from several grid cells shown here
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 329.93 339.57 <NA> <unk> in different colors each one has a grid like firing pattern across the environment and each cell 's grid like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 339.11 342.07 <NA> so the red one fires on this grid
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 341.62 343.61 <NA> and the green one on this one
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 343.61 354.94 <NA> and the blue on on this one so together it 's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you 'd find on a map
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 355.01 356.83 <NA> but using triangles <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 356.58 366.77 <NA> and as it moves around the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is so that it can use its own movements to know
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 366.44 368.5 <NA> where it is in its environment 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 368.1 370.46 <NA> do people have grid cells <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 370.46 379.97 <NA> well because all of the grid like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry the same orientations of grid shown in orange here <unk> it means that the net activity
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 380.08 390.68 <NA> <unk> of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we 're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between <unk> so we can put people <unk>
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 390.63 397.14 <NA> in an mri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 400.28 405.24 <NA> <unk> which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats so back to homer
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 405.17 417.94 <NA> <unk> he 's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked <unk> and that would be represented by the firing of boundary detecting cells he
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 417.76 421.09 <NA> 's also remembering the path he took out of the car park 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 421.09 429.76 <NA> which would be represented in the firing of grid cells now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire <unk> and he can return to the location where he parked
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 429.93 438.37 <NA> <unk> by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 438.17 447.43 <NA> where he parked his car <unk> and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car 's actually there <unk> maybe it 's been towed <unk> 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 447.03 450.34 <NA> but he knows where it was so he knows to go and get it 
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 450.12 454.94 <NA> so beyond spatial memory <unk> if we look for this grid like firing pattern
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 454.98 465.14 <NA> throughout the whole brain we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time <unk>
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 465.04 475.16 <NA> <unk> you went to a wedding for example <unk> so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 479.99 490.29 <NA> <unk> to us when we want to imagine them <unk> so if this was happening your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary <unk>
NeilBurgess_2011S 1 NeilBurgess_2011S 490.19 504.82 <NA> <unk> cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint and grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space another kind of cell head direction cells which i didn 't mention yet they fire like a compass according to which way you 're facing they could define the viewing
