TabethaBoyajian_2016 1 TabethaBoyajian_2016 367.53 369.55 <NA> the data were good <unk> 
TabethaBoyajian_2016 1 TabethaBoyajian_2016 370.26 378.83 <NA> and so what was happening had to be astrophysical meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight
TabethaBoyajian_2016 1 TabethaBoyajian_2016 380.23 387.5 <NA> <unk> and so at this point we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on

TabethaBoyajian_2016 1 TabethaBoyajian_2016 416 419.8 <NA> well <unk> both of these theories could explain part of the data <unk> 
TabethaBoyajian_2016 1 TabethaBoyajian_2016 419.59 423.31 <NA> but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young 
TabethaBoyajian_2016 1 TabethaBoyajian_2016 423.31 429.88 <NA> and there was no glow from any of the material that was heated up by the star 's light <unk> and you would expect this
