DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 499.16 504.91 <NA> i 'm like a coral biologist somebody 's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 504.84 507.31 <NA> <unk> fluorescent and there i am and
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 507.87 510.73 <NA> i was like maybe i should go back to corals 
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 511.02 519.68 <NA> laughter it turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent and then we found it in a deep dark canyon
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 519.52 523.34 <NA> off the coast of california we found the first
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 526.15 530.72 <NA> <unk> right underneath all the surfers here it is they 're just about a meter long <unk>
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 531.75 544.16 <NA> and they call them a swellshark because if they 're threatened they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube about twice their size and wedge themselves under a under a rock so they don 't get eaten by a predator <unk> 
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 543.67 546.36 <NA> and here is our first footage of these
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 554.96 562.74 <NA> <unk> are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent but they 've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark <unk> 
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 562.28 567.7 <NA> but this is all beautiful to see i was like this is gorgeous but
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 567.52 574.96 <NA> what does it mean to the shark can they see this and we looked in the literature <unk> and nothing was known about this shark
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 575.85 590.15 <NA> <unk> so i took this shark to eye specialist ellis loew at cornell university <unk> and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue green interface <unk> probably about one hundred times better than we can see in the dark but they only see blue green 
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 590.15 604.94 <NA> so what it 's doing is taking this blue world and it 's absorbing the blue creating green it 's creating contrast that they can indeed see so we have a model showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns <unk> and males and females
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 604.96 608.69 <NA> <unk> also have we 're finding distinct patterns among them <unk> 
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 608.74 618.54 <NA> but our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now in the solomon islands swimming at night <unk> i encountered the first

DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 625.55 632.01 <NA> <unk> this is only one month old but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle 's vision <unk> 
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 631.84 642.19 <NA> and it makes me think about how much more there is to learn <unk> and here in the solomon islands there 's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left and this is one of the hotspots for them <unk> 
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 642.14 647.25 <NA> <unk> so it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they 're still here and understand them 
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 649.69 654.85 <NA> i wanted to know how deep does it go does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean so we started
DavidGruber_2015Z 1 DavidGruber_2015Z 654.81 664.63 <NA> <unk> using submarines <unk> and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here <unk> and we dropped down and we noticed one important thing
