StacySmith_2016W 1 StacySmith_2016W 569.32 571.57 <NA> let 's talk about a few of them 
StacySmith_2016W 1 StacySmith_2016W 571.57 579.82 <NA> the first is what i call just add five did you know if we looked at the top one hundred films next year and simply added five female speaking characters
StacySmith_2016W 1 StacySmith_2016W 580.04 583.4 <NA> on screen to each of those films it would create a new norm

StacySmith_2016W 1 StacySmith_2016W 607.51 617.1 <NA> <unk> it doesn 't cost that much three it builds a pipeline for talent and four it humanizes the production process why <unk> because it makes sure that there 's women on set <unk>

StacySmith_2016W 1 StacySmith_2016W 635.91 644.22 <NA> now <unk> what does that mean well you probably don 't know but the typical feature film has about forty to forty five speaking characters in it 
StacySmith_2016W 1 StacySmith_2016W 644.06 649.93 <NA> i would argue that only eight to ten of those characters are actually relevant to the
StacySmith_2016W 1 StacySmith_2016W 655.65 666.97 <NA> <unk> the remaining thirty or so roles there 's no reason why those minor roles can 't match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking taking place 
StacySmith_2016W 1 StacySmith_2016W 666.97 675.02 <NA> an equity rider by an a lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we
