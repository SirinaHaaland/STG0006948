RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 258.75 265.27 <NA> so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on <unk> 
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 265.08 273.52 <NA> so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the the boat hook to the to the oars to reinforce it 
RozSavage_2010Z 1 RozSavage_2010Z 273.28 276.28 <NA> then when that gave out i sawed the
