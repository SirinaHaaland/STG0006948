MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 282.12 295.48 <NA> my instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit and as i said type is very adaptable <unk> it does hide its methods <unk>

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 378.7 388.05 <NA> <unk> as i say we were in the infancy of digital type <unk> i had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper there were four weights of bell centennial

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 419.11 427.5 <NA> and production process at the outset at & t had wanted to set the phone books in helvetica

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 442.11 452.14 <NA> i had to disambiguate these forms of the figures as much as possible in bell centennial by sort of opening the shapes up as you can see in the bottom part of that slide 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 452.58 454.52 <NA> so now we 're on to the
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 455.01 461.61 <NA> mid ' 80s the early days of digital outline fonts <unk> vector technology there was an issue

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 471.85 478.95 <NA> it limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time i did an analysis

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 479.78 489.54 <NA> <unk> data and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 496.28 504.22 <NA> the numbers at the bottom of the slide by the way they represent the amount of data needed to store each each of the fonts
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 505.32 509.99 <NA> <unk> so the sans serif in the middle sans the serifs was much more economical
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 529.84 535.78 <NA> <unk> sans serif we call it charter on the right <unk> so i went to the head of engineering
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 535.62 539.93 <NA> with my numbers and i said proudly i have solved your problem oh 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 539.98 549.84 <NA> he said what problem and i said well you know the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on oh he
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 550.58 560.31 <NA> <unk> we solved that problem last week we wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude you can have as many fonts on your system as you like 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 560.36 564.93 <NA> well thank you for letting me know i said <unk> foiled again <unk> 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 564.53 571.02 <NA> i was left with a design solution for a nonexistent technical problem <unk> 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 570.98 579.07 <NA> but here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me <unk> i didn 't just throw my design away in a fit of pique i persevered
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 580.05 583.24 <NA> <unk> had started as a technical exercise became
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 582.9 590.59 <NA> an aesthetic exercise really <unk> in other words <unk> i had come to like this typeface <unk> forget its origins <unk> screw that

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 592.82 595.54 <NA> the simplified forms of charter
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 595.05 599.9 <NA> gave it a sort of <unk> plain spoken quality and unfussy spareness that
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 601.93 612.56 <NA> <unk> at times of technical innovation designers want to be influenced by what 's in the air <unk> we want to respond we want to be pushed into exploring something new 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 612.61 615.74 <NA> so charter is a sort of parable for me really 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 615.74 624.87 <NA> in the end there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of charter i had really misunderstood the
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 627.95 634.62 <NA> <unk> technology did suggest something to me but it did not force my hand and i think this happens very often

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 658.89 666.55 <NA> but microsoft foresaw correctly the the movement the stampede towards electronic communication

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 677.23 689.51 <NA> they wanted a small core set of fonts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen which were their coarse resolution displays

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 711.62 718.77 <NA> microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away <unk> 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 718.76 727.93 <NA> so i thought well a decade that 's not bad that 's more than a stopgap <unk> so i was persuaded i was convinced and we went to work on what became
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 730.11 736.45 <NA> for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 736.23 742.13 <NA> at that time <unk> screens were binary the pixel was either on
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 741.97 749.72 <NA> or it was off <unk> here you see the outline of a letter the cap h <unk> which is the thin black line the

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 770.53 774.99 <NA> not so with an <unk> o this looks more like
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 776.75 788.67 <NA> <unk> but believe me <unk> this is a good bitmap o for the simple reason that it 's symmetrical in both x and y axes in a binary bitmap you actually can 't ask for more than that
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 788.51 798.33 <NA> i would sometimes make i don 't know three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase a and then stand back to choose which was the best 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 797.99 799.84 <NA> well there was no
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 800.88 809.44 <NA> <unk> so the designer 's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad is that a compromise 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 809.52 819.2 <NA> not to me <unk> if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow <unk> although that standard may be well short of the ideal 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 819.2 822.14 <NA> you may be able to see on this slide two different
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 821.97 824.96 <NA> bitmap fonts there the a in the upper one i think
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 826.15 828.29 <NA> <unk> the lower one but it still ain 't great
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 828.97 834.02 <NA> <unk> you can maybe see the effect better if it 's reduced well maybe not 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 833.95 838.4 <NA> so i 'm a pragmatist not an idealist <unk> out of necessity 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 838.12 845.45 <NA> for a certain kind of temperament there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 845.2 854.88 <NA> but can still be done to the best of your ability here 's the lowercase h from georgia italic the
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 854.81 861.94 <NA> <unk> bitmap looks jagged and rough it is jagged and rough but i discovered by experiment that there is an optimum

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 865.37 873.84 <NA> so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries look in this example how rough as it is how

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 895.44 900.01 <NA> microsoft were absolutely right it took a good ten years 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 899.73 904.73 <NA> but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution

MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 905.77 911.33 <NA> very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti aliasing and so on 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 911.2 915.26 <NA> so now that their mission is accomplished 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 914.86 921.44 <NA> has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that i designed for coarser displays back then 
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 921.34 930 <NA> will they outlive the now obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market or have they established
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 930.05 932.61 <NA> <unk> their own sort of evolutionary niche
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 932.44 940.86 <NA> that is independent of technology <unk> in other words have they been absorbed into the typographic mainstream i
MatthewCarter_2014 1 MatthewCarter_2014 941.27 949.63 <NA> 'm not sure but they 've had a good run so far <unk> hey eighteen is a good age for anything with present day rates of attrition <unk>
