BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 266.99 277.99 <NA> and that sounded revolutionary in my mind so for the next couple of years <unk> i started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways not only in the streets but mostly in studios and
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 279.9 288.52 <NA> <unk> beginning of two thousand and thirteen last year when i became the cofounder of a group called mdia ninja <unk> ninja is an acronym that stands for <unk>

BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 304.93 310.22 <NA> <unk> wise because you shouldn 't try to make money out of journalism now but
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 309.94 318.23 <NA> we had a very solid and clear conviction that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 318.04 324.96 <NA> could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 326.3 331.29 <NA> <unk> so we launched a facebook page first <unk> and then a manifesto <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 331.25 338.25 <NA> and started to cover the streets in a very simple way <unk> but then something happened something that wasn 't

BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 341.15 348.43 <NA> street protests started to erupt in so paulo they began as very local and specific they were against
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 348.27 354.94 <NA> the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city this is a bus it 's written there
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 355.01 357.59 <NA> theft but

BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 364.01 368.83 <NA> so the police violence against them started to grow as well <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 368.46 374.74 <NA> but there was another conflict the one i believe that 's more important here to make my point that
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 376.99 380.51 <NA> <unk> there was this mainstream media version of the facts
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 380.17 384.8 <NA> that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 384.34 385.85 <NA> if they
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 385.85 394.92 <NA> presented their own vision of what was actually happening there and it was this clash of visions this clash of narratives that i think
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 394.71 397.1 <NA> turned those protests
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 396.64 400.55 <NA> into a long period in the country of political reckoning
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 400.24 402.14 <NA> where
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 402.1 404.31 <NA> hundreds of thousands of people

BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 409.13 415.11 <NA> but it wasn 't about the bus fare hike anymore <unk> it was about everything 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 415.25 422.68 <NA> the people 's demands their expectations the reasons why they were on the streets could be as diverse as

BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 429.93 436.63 <NA> was in this environment of political catharsis that the country was going through
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 436.56 446.51 <NA> that it had to do with politics <unk> indeed but it had to do also with a new way of organizing through a new way of communicating it
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 446.51 453.53 <NA> was in that environment that mdia ninja emerged from almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 454.96 461.84 <NA> <unk> did have the right equipment <unk> we are not using big cameras <unk> we are using basically this <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 461.35 464.27 <NA> we are using smartphones <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 463.78 469.46 <NA> and that actually allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 469.45 474.93 <NA> but it allowed us to do something else to show what it was like to be in the
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 477.41 479.49 <NA> <unk> people at home a subjective
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 479.29 481.14 <NA> perspective <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 481.19 490.56 <NA> but there was something that is more important i think than the equipment it was our mindset <unk> because we are not behaving as a media outlet
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 490.31 499.99 <NA> we are not competing for news <unk> we are trying to encourage people to invite people and to actually teach people how to do this how they also
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 502.41 506.17 <NA> <unk> and that was crucial to turn mdia ninja from
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 505.71 514.45 <NA> from a small group of people and in a matter of weeks <unk> we multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 514.2 518.56 <NA> so in a matter of a week or two as the protests kept happening
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 518.49 529.94 <NA> <unk> we were hundreds of young people connected in this network throughout the country <unk> we were covering more than fifty cities at the same time that 's something that no tv channel could ever do
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 530.23 538.34 <NA> that was responsible for turning us suddenly actually into kind of the mainstream media of social media <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 538.57 546.3 <NA> so we had a couple of thousands of followers on our facebook page and soon we had a quarter of a million followers 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 546.3 549.84 <NA> our posts and our videos were being seen by more than
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 550 557.19 <NA> <unk> eleven million timelines a week it was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 557.45 564.85 <NA> and that turned mdia ninja into something else more than a media outlet than a media project <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 564.85 567.82 <NA> it became almost like a public service
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 567.46 575.64 <NA> to the citizen to the protester to the activist because they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 575.33 578.94 <NA> to confront both police and media
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 578.48 579.76 <NA> authority
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 581.1 589.96 <NA> many of our images started to be used in regular tv channels our livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular <unk>
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 589.86 595.58 <NA> <unk> televisions when things got really rough some our images were responsible
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 604.84 612 <NA> <unk> also turned mdia ninja very soon to be seen as almost an enemy of cops <unk> unfortunately <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 611.76 618.56 <NA> and we started to be severely beaten and eventually arrested on the streets it happened in many cases <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 618.56 629.97 <NA> but that was also useful because we were still at the web so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 630.2 633.9 <NA> and the state of the freedom of the press in the country 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 633.65 640.9 <NA> so mdia ninja now evolved and finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 640.66 645.52 <NA> it would become a national network of hundreds of young people

BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 689.59 699.81 <NA> journalism through a direct relationship with an audience with an active audience <unk> because now i really want to try to make a living out of my tear gas
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 702.71 709.68 <NA> <unk> there 's something more significant here something that i believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example <unk> 
BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 709.55 718.24 <NA> i said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal tv network <unk> but i believe it does something else <unk> because after watching

BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 735.99 740.21 <NA> because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast

BrunoTorturra_2014G 1 BrunoTorturra_2014G 780.29 783.12 <NA> because it really helps
