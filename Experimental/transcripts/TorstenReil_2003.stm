TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 14.5 21 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to talk about a technology that we 're developing at oxford now that we think is going to change the way
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 21 29.97 <NA> that computer games and hollywood movies are being made that technology is simulating humans it 's simulated humans
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 30.08 31.73 <NA> <unk> with a simulated body
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 31.74 40.47 <NA> and a simulated nervous system to control that body <unk> now before i talk more about that technology let 's have a quick look at what
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 40.16 44.16 <NA> human characters look like at the moment in computer games
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 44.93 51.93 <NA> this is a clip from a game called grand theft auto three we already saw that briefly yesterday <unk> and what you can see is
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 51.59 54.91 <NA> it is actually a very good game it 's one of the most successful games of
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 55.02 58.04 <NA> <unk> time but what you 'll see is that all the animations in this game
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 57.86 64.48 <NA> are very repetitive they pretty much look the same i 've made him run into a wall here over and over again <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 64.68 68.83 <NA> and you can see he looks always the same <unk> the reason for that is
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 68.34 73.69 <NA> that these characters are actually not real characters they are a
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 73.29 79.97 <NA> graphical visualization of a character to produce these animations an animator at a studio has
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 79.99 81.21 <NA> <unk> to anticipate
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 81 82.43 <NA> what 's going to happen
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 82.26 88.49 <NA> in the actual game <unk> and then has to animate that particular sequence so he or she sits down <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 88.12 95.51 <NA> animates it and tries to anticipate what 's going to happen <unk> and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 95.32 104.97 <NA> in the computer game <unk> now <unk> the result of that is that you can 't have real interactivity all you have is animations that are played back at
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 105.01 106.01 <NA> more or less
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 105.67 109.23 <NA> the appropriate times <unk> it also means that games
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 108.89 120.82 <NA> aren 't really going to be as surprising as they could be because you only get out of it at least in terms of the character what you actually put into it there 's no real emergence there <unk> and thirdly as i said <unk> most of the animations
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 120.65 125.11 <NA> are very repetitive because of that now <unk> the only way to get around
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 125 129.04 <NA> <unk> that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 128.61 135.97 <NA> that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body and maybe if i could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 136.29 137.53 <NA> because
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 139.25 145.67 <NA> it 's very very trivial <unk> if i push chris a bit like this for example he 'll react to it if i push him from a different angle he
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 145.67 150.2 <NA> 'll react to it differently and that 's because he has a physical body and because he has
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 150.19 159.05 <NA> <unk> the motor skills to control that body it 's a very trivial thing it 's not something you get in computer games at the moment at all thank you very much chris anderson that 's it torsten reil that 's it yes so 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 159.1 161.34 <NA> that 's what we 're trying to simulate
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 161.01 163.49 <NA> not chris specifically i should say but
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 163.32 165.08 <NA> humans in general
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 166.03 175.97 <NA> now <unk> we started working on this a while ago at oxford university and we tried to start very simply what we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 175.63 179.76 <NA> that stick figure is physically stimulated you can see it here on the screen so
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 179.9 185.01 <NA> <unk> it 's subject to gravity has joints etc <unk> if you just run the simulation it will just collapse like this
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 184.7 193.65 <NA> <unk> the tricky bit is now to put an ai controller in it that actually makes it work and for that we use the neural network which we based on
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 193.34 196.56 <NA> that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 196.55 204.97 <NA> that controls walking in humans it 's called the central pattern generator <unk> so we simulated that as well <unk> and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 205.2 208.06 <NA> for that we used artificial evolution
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 207.6 216.7 <NA> genetic algorithms we heard about those already yesterday and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already but just briefly the concept is is that you create
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 216.24 225.05 <NA> a large number of different individuals neural networks in this case all of which are random at the beginning <unk> you hook these up in this case to the virtual muscles
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 226.99 232.37 <NA> <unk> creature here and hope that it does something interesting at the beginning they 're all going to be
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 231.97 240.98 <NA> very boring most of them won 't move at all but some of them might make a tiny step those are then selected by the algorithm reproduced with mutation and
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 240.55 252.83 <NA> recombinations to introduce sex as well <unk> and you repeat that process over and over again until you have something that walks in this case in a straight line like this so that was the idea behind this when we started this i set up the simulation
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 252.4 254.67 <NA> one evening it took about three to
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 254.87 259.86 <NA> <unk> hours to run the simulation i got up the next morning went to the computer
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 259.55 264.58 <NA> and looked at the results and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line like i 've just demonstrated <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 264.58 267.54 <NA> and this is what i got instead 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 278.6 280.99 <NA> back to the drawing board for us <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 281.67 284.74 <NA> we did get it to work eventually
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 284.28 291.28 <NA> <unk> after tweaking a bit here and there <unk> and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run so what you 'll see in a moment is
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 291.03 297.82 <NA> a very simple biped that 's learning how to walk using artificial evolution at the beginning it can 't walk at all <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 297.6 300.31 <NA> but it will get better and better over time <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 302.31 304.49 <NA> so this is the one that can 't walk at all
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 310.84 315.47 <NA> now after five generations of applying evolutionary process the genetic algorithm
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 315.04 317.3 <NA> is getting a tiny bit better 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 325.52 327.36 <NA> <unk> take a few steps more
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 330.23 333.18 <NA> still not quite there <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 334.22 338.94 <NA> but now after generation twenty it actually walks in a straight line without falling over
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 340.13 342.96 <NA> <unk> that was the real breakthrough for us <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 343.4 349.29 <NA> it was academically quite a challenging project and once we had reached that stage we were quite confident that we could
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 348.92 354.97 <NA> try and do other things as well with with this approach actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 354.87 356.47 <NA> <unk> system that controls it 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 356.04 367.57 <NA> now <unk> at this stage it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds <unk> <unk> what you see here is the character standing there and there 's an obstacle that we put in its way <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 368.01 377.05 <NA> and what you see is it 's going to fall over the obstacle now <unk> the interesting bit is if i move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right which is what i 'm doing now here <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 376.62 378.64 <NA> it will fall over it
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 378.61 379.61 <NA> in
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 380.02 381.2 <NA> <unk> different way <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 383.8 388.7 <NA> and again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit it 'll again fall differently 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 390.22 397.98 <NA> now what you see by the way at the top there are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles okay that 's the video thanks
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 397.98 404.97 <NA> now this might look kind of trivial but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 407.51 417.72 <NA> now at this stage <unk> we decided to start a company and move this further because obviously this was just a very simple blocky biped <unk> what we really wanted was a full human body so we started the company 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 417.26 424.81 <NA> we hired a team of physicists software engineers and biologists to work on this and the first thing we had to work on was to create
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 428.79 438.28 <NA> <unk> it 's got to be relatively fast so you can run it on a normal machine but it 's got to be accurate enough so it looks good enough basically <unk> so we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 438.9 446.15 <NA> and tried to make it as realistic as possible <unk> what you see here on the screen right now <unk> is a very simple visualization of that body
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 445.96 454.73 <NA> i should add that it 's very simple to add things like hair clothes etc but what we 've done here is use a very simple simple visualization so you can concentrate on the movement
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 455.11 461.24 <NA> <unk> now what i 'm going to do right now in a moment is just push this character a tiny bit and we 'll see what happens 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 465.73 474.41 <NA> nothing really interesting basically <unk> it falls over but it falls over like a rag doll basically <unk> the reason for that is is that there 's no intelligence in it <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 473.98 474.99 <NA> it becomes
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 475 479.58 <NA> <unk> interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it so this character now has
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 479.3 481.86 <NA> motor skills in the upper body
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 481.4 484.18 <NA> nothing in the legs yet <unk> in this particular one <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 483.97 494.07 <NA> but what it will do i 'm going to push it again <unk> it will realize autonomously that it 's being pushed it 's going to stick out its hands it 's going to turn around into the fall and try and catch the fall <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 500.39 504.97 <NA> so that 's what you see here <unk> now <unk> it gets really interesting
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 504.9 511.52 <NA> <unk> if you then add the ai for the lower part of the body as well so here we 've got the same character i 'm going to push it a bit harder
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 511.34 515.44 <NA> now <unk> harder than i just pushed chris <unk> but what you 'll see is
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 515.37 518.65 <NA> it 's going to receive a push now from from the left 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 521.13 528.92 <NA> what you see is it takes steps backwards <unk> it tries to counter balance it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 529.9 538.64 <NA> <unk> again <unk> and then finally hits the floor <unk> now this becomes really exciting
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 538.18 539.58 <NA> when you
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 539.34 543.65 <NA> push that character in different directions again just as i 've done
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 543.67 549.99 <NA> that 's something that you cannot do right now at the moment you only have empty computer graphics in in games <unk>
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 550.16 560.46 <NA> <unk> what this is now is a real simulation that 's what i want to show you now <unk> so here 's the same character with the same behavior i 've just shown you but now i 'm just going to push it from different directions first starting with a push from the right
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 563.15 569.16 <NA> this is all slow motion by the way so we can see what 's going on now <unk> the angle will have changed a tiny bit so
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 570.32 574.96 <NA> you can see that the reaction is different again a push now this time from
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 577.53 580.48 <NA> <unk> and you see it falls differently <unk> and now from the left
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 582.84 584.71 <NA> and it falls differently
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 584.43 593.47 <NA> <unk> that was really exciting for us to see that that was the first time we 've seen that this is the first time the public sees this as well because we have been in stealth mode i haven 't shown this to anybody yet
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 593.55 599.99 <NA> <unk> now <unk> just a fun thing what happens if you put that character this is now a wooden version of it but it 's got the same ai in it
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 600.34 601.64 <NA> <unk> if you put that character
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 601.47 605.99 <NA> on a slippery surface like ice <unk> we just did that for a laugh just to see what happens 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 606.34 608.18 <NA> and this is what happens it
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 615.4 621.71 <NA> 's nothing we had to do about this we just took this character that i just talked about put it on a slippery surface and this is what you get out of it and that 's
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 621.71 624.35 <NA> a really fascinating thing about this approach
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 625.36 629.94 <NA> <unk> now when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 629.96 635.82 <NA> got a very good response <unk> and what they said was the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 635.57 642.73 <NA> <unk> because stunts are obviously very dangerous they 're very expensive and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do obviously because you can 't really
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 642.56 652.08 <NA> allow the the stuntman to be seriously hurt so they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that 's what we 've been working on for the past few months <unk> and that 's our first
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 651.62 654.94 <NA> product that we 're going to release in a couple of weeks
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 655.38 661.54 <NA> so here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked <unk> that 's what people want that 's what we 're giving them 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 669.09 672.79 <NA> you can see it 's always reacting this is not a dead body this is a body
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 672.96 676.37 <NA> who basically in this particular case feels the force and tries to protect its head
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 679.93 684.26 <NA> <unk> kind of sorry for that thing and we 've seen it so many times now that we don 't really care any more 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 685.81 689.78 <NA> there are much worse videos than this by the way which i have taken out but 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 691.51 700.11 <NA> now here 's another one what people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion <unk> a strong force applied to the character and have the character react to it
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 700.04 713.4 <NA> <unk> in midair so that you don 't have a character that looks limp <unk> but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away that looks kind of alive in midair as well <unk> so this character is going to be hit by a force it 's going to realize it 's in the air and it 's going to try and
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 714.2 717.39 <NA> stick out its arm in the direction where it 's landing that
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 718.73 725.05 <NA> 's one angle here 's another angle <unk> we now think that the realism we 're achieving with this is good enough
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 725.19 734.5 <NA> <unk> used in films and let 's just have a look at a slightly different visualization <unk> this is something i just got last night from an animation studio in london who are using our software and
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 734.19 740.59 <NA> experimenting with it right now <unk> so this is exactly the same behavior that you saw but in a slightly
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 741 750.08 <NA> better rendered version <unk> so if you look at the character carefully you see there are lots of body movements going on none of which you have to animate like in the old
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 750.73 755.63 <NA> <unk> to actually animate them <unk> this is all happening automatically in the simulation this is a slightly different angle <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 757.93 760.73 <NA> and again a slow motion version of this <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 761.17 774.77 <NA> this is incredibly quick this is happening in real time you can run this simulation in real time in front of your eyes change it if you want to <unk> and you get the animation straight out of it <unk> at the moment doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 775.09 779.88 <NA> <unk> this is another behavior they requested i 'm not quite sure why but we 've done it anyway it 's a very simple
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 779.84 788.31 <NA> <unk> behavior that shows you the power of this approach in this case the character 's hands are fixed to a particular point in space <unk> and all we 've told the character to do is to struggle <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 789.02 798.55 <NA> and it looks organic it looks realistic you feel kind of sorry for the guy it 's even worse and that is another video i just got last night if you render that a bit more realistically
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 802.68 812.89 <NA> <unk> 'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel how realistic it can look and this is all a physical simulation of the body <unk> using ai to drive virtual muscles in that body <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 814.38 815.89 <NA> now <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 815.88 822.58 <NA> one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene and one of the most famous stunts is the one where james bond
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 822.21 824.99 <NA> jumps off a dam in switzerland and then is
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 834.07 835.64 <NA> <unk> just about see it here in
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 836.14 842.36 <NA> this case they were using a real stunt man it was a very dangerous stunt it was just voted i think in the sunday times as one of the most impressive stunts 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 842.36 849.69 <NA> now we 've just tried and looked at our character and asked ourselves can we do that ourselves as well can we use the physical simulation of the character use artificial
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 850.58 860.61 <NA> <unk> put that artificial intelligence into the character drive virtual muscles simulate the way he jumps off the dam <unk> and then skydive afterwards and have him caught by a bungee
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 860.15 866.1 <NA> afterwards <unk> we did that it took about altogether just two hours pretty much to create the simulation 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 865.61 867.78 <NA> and that 's what it looks like here
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 877.26 884.36 <NA> <unk> this could do with a bit more work it 's still very early stages and we pretty much just did this for a laugh just to see what we 'd get out of it but what we found
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 884.18 893.81 <NA> over the past few months is that this this approach <unk> that we 're pretty much standard upon is is incredibly powerful we are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 893.81 899.99 <NA> out of the simulations there 's very often very surprising behavior that you didn 't predict before <unk> there 's so many things we
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 902.44 908.72 <NA> <unk> going to be virtual stuntmen <unk> several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen and they 're going to hit the screen
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 908.35 914.06 <NA> quite soon actually for some major productions <unk> the second thing is
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 913.57 924.44 <NA> video games with this technology video games will look different and they will feel very different for the first time you 'll have actors that really feel very interactive that have real bodies that really react
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 924.25 929.97 <NA> <unk> i think that 's going to be incredibly exciting <unk> probably starting with sports games which are going to become much more interactive
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 930.38 937.83 <NA> <unk> but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in in online worlds <unk> like there for example that tom melcher has shown us <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 937.83 943.14 <NA> the degree of interactivity you 're going to get is totally different i think from what you 're getting right now 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 943.91 948.99 <NA> a third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 948.74 954.97 <NA> we 've been approached by several simulation companies but one project we 're particularly excited about which we 're starting next month is to use
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 954.93 957.67 <NA> <unk> our technology and in particular the walking technology
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 957.44 962.08 <NA> to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 961.71 971.78 <NA> to predict the outcome of operations on these children as you probably know <unk> it 's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 971.6 979.55 <NA> the classic quote is i think it 's unpredictable at best is what people think right now is the outcome <unk> now what we want to do with our software is allow
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 980.23 982.25 <NA> <unk> our surgeons to have a tool
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 981.85 992.31 <NA> <unk> we 're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait before he actually commits to to an actual surgery <unk> 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 992.31 995.39 <NA> that 's one project we 're particularly excited about 
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 994.96 997.31 <NA> and that 's going to start next month
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 1001 1006.77 <NA> <unk> this is only just the beginning we can only do several behaviors right now the ai isn 't good enough to simulate a full human body
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 1006.28 1016.67 <NA> the body yes but not all the motor skills that we have and i think we 're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing right now we don 't have that but i 'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 1016.36 1025.17 <NA> <unk> we do have one unintentional dancer actually the last thing i 'm going to show you this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 1025.73 1035.68 <NA> <unk> i should say to produce balance basically so you kick the guy and the guy 's supposed to counter balance that 's what we thought was going to come out of this <unk> but this is what emerged out of it in the end
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 1075.78 1078.47 <NA> <unk> that 's just the simulation creating this itself basically
TorstenReil_2003 1 TorstenReil_2003 1084.82 1089.43 <NA> not quite john travolta yet but we 're working on that as well so thanks very much for
