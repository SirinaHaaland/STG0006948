SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 443.6 449.99 <NA> surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is i 'm not a geneticist so i won

SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 461.41 475.05 <NA> <unk> so we can work with geneticists who understand that <unk> so when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks <unk> they found that the diversity was incredibly low if you look at the first line really you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 477.26 478.81 <NA> <unk> come from a common ancestry 
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 478.57 487.14 <NA> but if you look at nucleotide diversity <unk> which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents you see that basking sharks if you look at the first study 
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 487.14 500.2 <NA> was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species you can see this work was only done in two thousand and six before two thousand and six we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks we had no idea did they distinguish into different populations
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 501.54 506.74 <NA> <unk> that 's very important if you want to know what the population size is and the status of the animals <unk> so 
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 506.28 512.05 <NA> les noble in aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable really <unk> so
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 512.34 514.69 <NA> he did another study using
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 515.13 522.88 <NA> microsatellites which is much more expensive much more time consuming and to his surprise came up with almost identical results <unk> 
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 522.42 529.7 <NA> so it does seem to be that basking sharks for some reason have incredibly low diversity and it 's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 530.08 538.4 <NA> <unk> thought to have been twelve thousand years ago <unk> and this has caused a very low diversity and yet if you look at the whale shark which is the other plankton eating large

SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 543.03 553.92 <NA> they found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world 's oceans of basking sharks even though they 're found throughout the world you couldn 't tell the difference genetically from one from the pacific atlantic new zealand

SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 560.12 570.73 <NA> i don 't understand or pretend to understand this i suspect most geneticists don 't either but they produce the numbers so you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics 
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 570.73 577.5 <NA> and rus hoelzel came up with an effective population size eight thousand two hundred animals that 's it

SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 579.98 586 <NA> that 's ridiculous no way so les did a finer study <unk> and he found out it came out about nine thousand
SimonBerrow_2010X 1 SimonBerrow_2010X 585.66 590.75 <NA> using different microsatellites gave the different results but the mean of all these studies
