PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 20.11 25.11 <NA> in particular i want to talk about the design of diarrhea
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 25.46 29.41 <NA> <unk> and when evolutionary biologists talk about design they really mean
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 29.23 31.26 <NA> design by natural selection 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 31.26 39.85 <NA> and that brings me to the title of the talk using evolution to design disease organisms intelligently and i also have a little bit of a sort of smartass
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 39.52 41.49 <NA> subtitle to this <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 41.06 50.88 <NA> but i 'm not just doing this to be cute <unk> i really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me who 's sort of a darwin wannabe <unk> how they actually look at
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 50.63 54.76 <NA> one 's role in sort of coming into this field of health

PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 56.01 66.04 <NA> it 's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists <unk> you actually see a great potential but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf and may actually be very resistant <unk>
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 68.19 75.02 <NA> <unk> when one tries to introduce ideas <unk> so <unk> all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 75.91 85.67 <NA> <unk> why are some disease organisms more harmful and a very closely related question which is how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question how can we make
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 85.44 99.87 <NA> the harmful organisms more mild <unk> and i 'm going to be talking to begin with as i said about diarrheal disease organisms <unk> and the focus when i 'm talking about the diarrheal organisms as well as the focus when i 'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 99.87 101.24 <NA> is to
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 100.93 104.25 <NA> think about the problem from a germ 's point of view
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 105.04 111.48 <NA> <unk> and in particular to think about a fundamental idea which i think makes sense out of a tremendous amount <unk>
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 113.23 116.67 <NA> of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms <unk> and that idea
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 116.66 125.11 <NA> is that from the germ 's eye point of view disease organisms have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 125.64 128.62 <NA> <unk> of the host to move them to another host but not always 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 128.62 136.09 <NA> sometimes you get disease organisms that don 't rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 135.66 141.65 <NA> evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative more
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 143.27 152.92 <NA> so natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 152.61 154.79 <NA> the winners of the competition will be the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 155.05 159.86 <NA> <unk> organisms so if the pathogen doesn 't need the host to be healthy and active <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 159.43 167.27 <NA> and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 166.99 174.87 <NA> reproductive success <unk> but if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen <unk> then it 's the benign ones that tend to be the winners
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 175.43 184.75 <NA> <unk> going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways they can be transmitted from person to person contact
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 186.41 195.18 <NA> <unk> contact when somebody eats contaminated food or they can be transmitted through the water <unk> and when they 're transmitted through the water <unk> unlike the first two modes of transmission <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 194.93 200.02 <NA> these pathogens don 't rely on a healthy host for transmission a person can be sick in bed and still
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 200.97 205.09 <NA> <unk> even hundreds of other individuals to sort of illustrate that this diagram
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 204.75 212.72 <NA> emphasizes that if you 've got a sick person in bed somebody 's going to be taking out the contaminated materials they 're going to wash those contaminated materials <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 212.72 217.45 <NA> and then the water may move into sources of drinking water people will come in to
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 217.14 223.19 <NA> those places where you 've got contaminated drinking water bring things back to the family may drink right at that point the whole point
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 223.03 229.61 <NA> is that a person who can 't move can still infect many other individuals <unk> and so the theory tells us that
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 230.23 234.7 <NA> <unk> when diarrheal disease organisms are are transported by water <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 234.71 249.12 <NA> we expect them to be more predator like more harmful and you can test these ideas so one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water <unk> tend to be more harmful and the answer is yep they are now i put those names in there just for the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 248.93 249.96 <NA> bacteria buffs
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 253.7 255.36 <NA> <unk> lot of them here i can tell
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 255.38 261.86 <NA> the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong positive association between
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 261.7 269.11 <NA> the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water <unk> and how harmful they are how much death they cause per untreated infection 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 269.11 275.07 <NA> so this suggests we 're on the right track <unk> but this <unk> to me suggests that we really
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 274.73 279.82 <NA> need to ask some additional questions remember the second question that i raised at the outset was
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 279.96 284.29 <NA> <unk> how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 284.06 294.41 <NA> now this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission <unk> you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right hand side of that graph to the left hand side of the graph but it doesn 't tell you how long 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 294.36 304.91 <NA> <unk> i mean if this would require thousands of years then it 's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens but if it could occur in just a few years <unk> then it might be a very important way to control some of the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 304.87 309.35 <NA> <unk> nasty problems that we haven 't been able to control in other words 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 308.98 323.21 <NA> this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms we could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us <unk> and so <unk> as i was thinking about this i focused on this organism which is the el tor biotype of the organism called vibrio cholerae and that is
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 323.29 329.97 <NA> the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera <unk> and the reason i thought this is a really great organism to look
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 329.96 334.18 <NA> <unk> at is that we understand why it 's so harmful it 's harmful because
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 333.94 344.58 <NA> it produces a toxin and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen the internal <unk>
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 344.48 354.94 <NA> <unk> chamber of our intestine and then that fluid goes the only way it can which is out the other end and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 354.95 367.84 <NA> so what happens if you 've got an organism it produces a lot of toxin after a few days of infection you end up having the fecal material really isn 't so disgusting as we might imagine it 's sort of cloudy water <unk> and if you took a drop of that water <unk> you might find
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 367.53 375.02 <NA> a million diarrheal organisms if the organism produced a lot of toxin you might find ten million or one hundred million if it didn 't produce a lot of this toxin
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 380.74 391.5 <NA> <unk> the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 391.29 399.3 <NA> by person to person contact or person food person contact both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 399.3 404.76 <NA> now i can think of some of some possible experiments one would be to take a lot of different strains of this
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 404.72 408.48 <NA> <unk> organism some that produce a lot of toxins some that produce a little and
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 408.83 418.93 <NA> take those strains and and spew them out in different countries some countries that might have clean water supplies so that you can 't get waterborne transmission <unk> you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 418.93 424.66 <NA> other countries in which you 've got a lot of waterborne transmission <unk> there you expect these organisms to evolve
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 424.48 429.76 <NA> towards a high level of harmfulness right there 's a little ethical problem in this
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 429.69 437.98 <NA> <unk> experiment <unk> i was hoping to hear a few gasps at least that makes me worry a little bit but anyhow the laughter
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 437.81 439.72 <NA> makes me feel a little bit better
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 439.62 448.24 <NA> <unk> and this ethical problem 's a big problem just to emphasize this <unk> this is what we 're really talking about here 's a girl who 's almost dead she got rehydration therapy she
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 448.02 454.67 <NA> perked up within a few days she was looking like a completely different person so we don 't want to run an experiment like that but interestingly
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 455.16 457.74 <NA> that thing happened in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one in one <unk> thousand 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 457.74 465.77 <NA> nine hundred and ninety one this cholera organism got into lima peru and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas <unk> now 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 466.24 471.53 <NA> i don 't know how that happened <unk> and i didn 't have anything to do with it i
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 471.07 474.96 <NA> promise you i don 't think anybody knows but i 'm not averse
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 475.64 484.89 <NA> <unk> once that 's happened to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that i did make before actually holds up did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like chile 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 484.89 490.09 <NA> which has some of the most well protected water supplies in latin america <unk> and did it
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 489.9 499.26 <NA> evolve to be more harmful in a place like ecuador which has some of the least well protected and peru 's got something sort of in between <unk> and so <unk> with
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 498.9 499.9 <NA> funding
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 501.48 509.03 <NA> <unk> i got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab and we found that in chile
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 508.79 513 <NA> within two months of the invasion of peru you had strains entering chile
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 512.84 522.61 <NA> and when you look at those strains in the very far left hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in the toxin production each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person a
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 522.61 529.97 <NA> lot of variation on which natural selection can act but the interesting point is if you look over the 1990s within a few years the organisms
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 529.96 538.91 <NA> <unk> evolved to be more mild they evolved to produce less toxin and to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we find
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 538.54 543.24 <NA> that there 's only one case of cholera on average reported from chile
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 543.24 548.78 <NA> every two years so it 's controlled that 's how much we have in america cholera that 's acquired
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 548.38 549.99 <NA> endemically and we don 't think we 've
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 551.27 553.14 <NA> <unk> they solved the problem in chile 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 553.28 561.12 <NA> but before we get too confident we 'd better look at some of those other countries and make sure that this organism doesn 't just always evolve toward mildness <unk> well <unk> in peru it didn 't <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 560.93 569.55 <NA> and in ecuador remember this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission it looked like it got more harmful in every case there 's a lot of variation but
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 569.6 575.58 <NA> something about the environment the people are living in and i think the only realistic explanation is that it 's the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 575.58 579.94 <NA> the degree of waterborne transmission <unk> favored the harmful strains in one place
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 579.9 581.31 <NA> <unk> and mild strains in another <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 581.09 591.55 <NA> so this is very encouraging it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow if we had enough money could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck it would make these organisms evolve to mildness <unk> so that even though people <unk>
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 591.45 604.82 <NA> <unk> might be getting infected they 'd be infected with mild strains it wouldn 't be causing severe disease <unk> but there 's another really interesting aspect of this <unk> and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence evolution of harmfulness <unk> then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance and the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 604.96 611.2 <NA> <unk> is very simple if you 've got a harmful organism a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic a high proportion of the people are going to be going
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 611.21 615.74 <NA> to get antibiotics you 've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance so you get
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 615.37 621.08 <NA> increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance <unk> and
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 620.68 629.94 <NA> once you get increased antibiotic resistance the antibiotics aren 't knocking out the harmful strains anymore so you 've got a higher level of virulence so you get this vicious cycle the goal is to turn this around <unk> if you could
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 629.95 640.15 <NA> cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance so we can go to the same countries and look and see 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 640.1 646.45 <NA> <unk> did chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance <unk> whereas did ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem if
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 650.49 663.38 <NA> <unk> in this case on the y axis we 've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity and i won 't go into that but we 've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in chile peru and ecuador and no trend across the years <unk> but if we look at the end of the 1990s just
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 663.2 664.76 <NA> half a decade later <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 664.58 676.96 <NA> we see that in ecuador they started having a resistance problem antibiotic sensitivity was going down <unk> and in chile <unk> you still had antibiotic sensitivity so it looks like chile dodged two bullets they got the organism to evolve to mildness <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 676.96 679.94 <NA> and they got no development of antibiotic resistance
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 680.01 681.77 <NA> <unk> now these ideas should apply
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 681.77 690.81 <NA> across the board as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence <unk> and i want to give you just one more example because we 've talked a little bit about malaria <unk> and the example
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 690.39 692.27 <NA> i want to deal with is 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 692.95 699.47 <NA> or the idea i want to deal with the question is what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 699.47 702.74 <NA> now malaria 's transmitted by a mosquito and normally if you 're
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 702.7 704.88 <NA> infected with malaria and you 're feeling sick
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 704.9 714.03 <NA> <unk> makes it even easier for the mosquito to to bite you and you can show just by looking at data from literature that vector borne diseases are more harmful than non vector borne diseases <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 714.5 715.63 <NA> but
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 715.47 725.02 <NA> i think there 's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this in the case of waterborne transmission we 'd like to clean up the water supplies
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 725.16 731.21 <NA> <unk> see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness in the case of malaria what we 'd like to do
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 731 732.46 <NA> is
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 732.24 734.38 <NA> mosquito proof houses
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 733.95 742.75 <NA> <unk> and the logic 's a little more subtle here if you mosquito proof houses when people get sick they 're sitting in bed or in mosquito proof hospitals they 're sitting in a hospital bed
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 742.35 750.55 <NA> and the mosquitoes can 't get to them so if you 're a harmful variant in a place where you 've got mosquito proof housing <unk> then you 're a loser 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 750.84 754.91 <NA> the only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 755.02 757.64 <NA> <unk> to walk outside and get mosquito bites 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 757.36 770.3 <NA> so if you were to mosquito proof houses you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness and there 's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this <unk> and that experiment was done in
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 769.93 775.94 <NA> northern alabama just to give you a little perspective on this i 've given you a star at the intellectual center
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 775.81 779.97 <NA> of the united states which is right there in louisville kentucky
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 780.16 788.88 <NA> <unk> and this really cool experiment was done about two hundred miles south of there in northern alabama by the tennessee valley authority they had
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 788.42 791.24 <NA> dammed up the tennessee river they 'd caused

PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 794.49 801.31 <NA> and when you get stagnant water you get mosquitoes they found in the late ' 30s ten years after they 'd made these dams
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 801.12 802.92 <NA> that the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 803 804.94 <NA> people in northern alabama
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 805.29 810.04 <NA> were infected with malaria about a third a third to half of them were infected with malaria
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 809.84 813.07 <NA> this shows you the positions of some of these dams 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 813.36 819.06 <NA> ok so the tennessee valley authority was in a little bit of a bind there wasn 't ddt 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 819.06 824.18 <NA> there wasn 't chloroquines what do they do well they decided to mosquito proof every house in northern alabama 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 823.99 829.97 <NA> so they did they divided northern alabama into eleven zones <unk> and within three years about one hundred dollars per house
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 830.05 831.56 <NA> <unk> they mosquito proofed every house

PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 841.54 854.79 <NA> <unk> you can see is that just the mosquito proofed housing and nothing else caused the eradication of malaria <unk> and this was incidentally published in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine in the leading textbook of malaria called boyd 's malariology but almost no malaria experts
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 855.02 863.83 <NA> <unk> know it exists <unk> this is important <unk> because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses now i would suggest that
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 863.83 867.88 <NA> you could do this in a lot of places like you know just
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 867.65 875.02 <NA> as you get into the malaria zone sub saharan africa but as you move to really intense biting rate areas like nigeria you
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 876.54 881.2 <NA> <unk> that 's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness <unk> so to me it 's <unk>
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 881 891.37 <NA> an experiment that 's waiting to happen and if it confirms the prediction then we should have a very powerful tool in a way much more powerful than the kind of tools we 're looking at because most of what 's being <unk>
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 891.27 899.87 <NA> <unk> done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs and we know that although it 's great to make those anti malarial drugs available at really low cost and
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 904.24 908.66 <NA> <unk> when you make them highly available you 're going to get resistance to those drugs and so it 's a short term solution this <unk>
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 909.94 911.07 <NA> <unk> i 'm suggesting here
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 910.89 922.91 <NA> is that we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen for example with anti malarial drugs <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 922.9 925.02 <NA> so <unk> this table i
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 925 927.79 <NA> <unk> given just to emphasize that i 've only talked about two
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 927.61 934.23 <NA> examples but as i said earlier this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases and it ought to 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 934.06 944.4 <NA> because when we 're dealing with infectious diseases we 're dealing with living systems we 're dealing with living systems we 're dealing with systems that evolve <unk> and so if you do something with those systems <unk>
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 944.35 949.87 <NA> they 're going to evolve one way or another and all i 'm saying is that we need to figure out how they 'll evolve so that we need to
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 950 964.42 <NA> <unk> adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck <unk> so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go <unk> so i don 't really have time to talk about those things but i did want to put them up there just to give you a sense that there really are solutions
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 963.93 971.08 <NA> to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we 're confronted with <unk> 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 972.33 974.9 <NA> and this this links up with a lot of the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 982.72 984.77 <NA> <unk> how do you really lower
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 984.49 989.95 <NA> sexual transmission of hiv what this emphasizes is that
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 989.79 998.15 <NA> we need to figure out how it will work will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area it may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 998.15 1004.97 <NA> faithful to partners and so on but the key thing is to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we 'll get an evolutionary change
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 1004.99 1012.11 <NA> <unk> the virus and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness and that will just add to the
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 1011.77 1020.54 <NA> effectiveness of our our control efforts so the other thing i really like about this <unk> besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 1020.54 1021.68 <NA> of
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 1021.58 1029.91 <NA> control of disease is that often the kinds of interventions that you want that it indicates should be done are the kinds of interventions interventions that people
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 1029.87 1033.26 <NA> <unk> want anyhow but people just haven 't been able to justify the cost 
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 1033.27 1040.33 <NA> so this is the kind of thing i 'm talking about <unk> if we know that we 're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water <unk> then
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 1040.09 1046.74 <NA> i think that we can say <unk> let 's push the effort into that aspect of the control <unk> so that we can actually
PaulEwald_2007 1 PaulEwald_2007 1046.58 1055.93 <NA> solve the problem <unk> even though if you just look at the frequency of infection you would suggest that you can 't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply
