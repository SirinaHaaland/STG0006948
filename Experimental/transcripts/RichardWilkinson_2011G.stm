RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 561.7 565.53 <NA> think of the expense <unk> the human cost of that 
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 566.15 575.11 <NA> i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points one is that in graph after graph
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 575 581.65 <NA> we find the countries that do worse whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones 
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 581.58 585.97 <NA> and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan <unk> 
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 585.96 594.73 <NA> so what we 're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality it 's not just one or two things that go wrong it 's most things 
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 594.81 599.99 <NA> the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that if you look at the
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 604.42 613.73 <NA> <unk> different countries in all sorts of ways the position of women how closely they keep to the nuclear family <unk> are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world 
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 614.02 619.43 <NA> but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality <unk> 
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 619.21 624.81 <NA> sweden has huge differences in earnings <unk> and it narrows the gap through taxation

RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 628.64 638.16 <NA> japan is rather different though it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax <unk> it has lower taxes <unk> it has a smaller welfare state <unk> 
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 637.79 650.05 <NA> and in our analysis of the american states we find rather the same contrast there are some states that do well through redistribution some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax
RichardWilkinson_2011G 1 RichardWilkinson_2011G 650.76 657.07 <NA> <unk> so we conclude that it doesn 't much matter how you get your greater equality as long as you get there somehow i
