KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 320.25 329.97 <NA> of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer what can we do so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 329.93 338.35 <NA> <unk> take cases <unk> but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers <unk> but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference for example in cambodia <unk> 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 338.35 350.2 <NA> it was that [ inaudible name ] did not go alone but she had twenty four lawyers with her who stood up together and in the same way in china they always tell me it 's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 350.94 353.42 <NA> <unk> in zimbabwe where i remember innocent <unk> 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 353.42 362.96 <NA> after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said i 've been here for one year eight years twelve years without a lawyer he came and we had a training together
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 362.75 372.22 <NA> and he said i have heard it said because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling i have heard it said that we cannot
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 371.76 374.96 <NA> help to create justice because we do not
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 376.3 382.65 <NA> <unk> and then he said but i want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 382.65 392.64 <NA> and with that he successfully organized <unk> sixty eight lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases <unk> the key that we see though is training
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 392.47 399.99 <NA> and then early access i was recently in egypt and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers <unk> and what they told me is that they said hey
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 400.79 408.51 <NA> <unk> we don 't have police on the streets now the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution they were torturing everybody all the time and
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 408.44 412.39 <NA> i said but there 's been tens of millions of dollars
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 413.42 421.41 <NA> <unk> that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here what 's going on i met with one of the development agencies <unk> 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 421.01 425.17 <NA> and they were training prosecutors and judges which is the normal
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 425.67 427.19 <NA> <unk> as opposed to defenders <unk> 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 426.98 433.32 <NA> and they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual i said i 'm gonna copy this it had everything in it 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 433.33 438.02 <NA> lawyers can come at the police station it was perfect prosecutors were perfectly trained 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 437.83 445.84 <NA> but i said to them i just have one question <unk> which is by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor 's office what had happened to them

KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 449.37 454.76 <NA> so the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers but us finding a way to
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 454.72 461.39 <NA> <unk> systematically implement early access to counsel because they are the safeguard in the system
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 461.16 469.38 <NA> for people who are being tortured and as i tell you this i 'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like oh okay it sounds like

KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 472.48 479.82 <NA> and there are many reasons why i believe it 's possible the first reason is the people on the ground
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 479.83 488.4 <NA> who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment it 's not only innocent who i told you about in in zimbabwe <unk> 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 488.17 496.14 <NA> but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces we have a program called justicemakers <unk>

KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 534.96 540.86 <NA> so in china for instance great laws came out where it says police
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 540.4 548.39 <NA> cannot torture people or they will be punished <unk> and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 548.38 554.31 <NA> and said how can we get this out <unk> how can we make sure that this is implemented this is fantastic and he said to me
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 554.98 557.37 <NA> you have money and i said 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 557.53 560.83 <NA> and he said that 's okay <unk> we can still figure it out 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 560.83 568.15 <NA> and on december four <unk> he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league from fourteen of the top law schools

KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 581.4 590.47 <NA> so i talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders we need to systematically implement early access to counsel <unk> but the third and most important thing
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 589.98 593.11 <NA> is that we make a commitment to this <unk> 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 592.88 599.11 <NA> and people often say to me you know this is great <unk> but it 's wildly idealistic never going to happen 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 599.1 604.91 <NA> and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 604.84 607.59 <NA> <unk> used for people who decided they would end slavery 
KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 607.38 613.18 <NA> or end apartheid <unk> it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit

KarenTse_2011G 1 KarenTse_2011G 648.28 650.76 <NA> but second of all i would
