HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 13.12 24.93 <NA> <unk> are some images of clusters of galaxies <unk> they 're exactly what they sound like <unk> they are these huge collections of galaxies <unk> bound together by their mutual gravity <unk> so most of the points that you see on the
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 28.01 30.99 <NA> <unk> but collections of stars or galaxies <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 30.56 43.2 <NA> now by showing you some of these images i hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects <unk> but more than that i think galaxy clusters are mysterious <unk> they are surprising <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 43.2 48.39 <NA> and they 're useful useful as the universe 's most massive laboratories <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 48.32 54.91 <NA> and as laboratories to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 54.92 62.41 <NA> and i think there are four major types <unk> and the first type that i want to describe is probing the very big <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 61.95 72.67 <NA> so how big <unk> well <unk> here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster it is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent <unk>
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 72.62 79.97 <NA> it 's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster and in fact if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 80.64 91.92 <NA> now to give you a number this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns it 's just mind boggling how massive these systems can get
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 91.92 99.99 <NA> <unk> but more than their mass they have this additional feature <unk> they are essentially isolated systems <unk> so if we like we can think of them as
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 101.51 111.93 <NA> <unk> of the entire universe and many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales <unk> such as how does gravity work might be answered by studying these systems 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 111.53 125.02 <NA> so that was very big <unk> the second things is very hot <unk> okay <unk> if i take an image of a galaxy cluster <unk> and i subtract away all of the starlight what i 'm left with is this big blue blob this is in false color
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 126.24 134.39 <NA> <unk> light that we 're seeing <unk> and the question is <unk> if it 's not galaxies <unk> what is emitting this light the answer is hot gas
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 135.41 141.43 <NA> gas in fact it 's plasma <unk> and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 141.03 154.94 <NA> the extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds <unk> and great speeds means great temperatures <unk> so this is the main idea <unk> but science is a rough draft there are many basic
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 154.9 163.67 <NA> <unk> properties about this plasma that still confuse us still puzzle us <unk> and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 163.87 171.95 <NA> third thing <unk> probing the very small <unk> now to explain this i need to tell you a very disturbing fact <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 171.88 175.02 <NA> most of the universe 's matter is
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 175 178.08 <NA> <unk> not made up of atoms you were lied to 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 177.92 183.66 <NA> most of it is made up of something very very mysterious <unk> which we call dark matter 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 183.29 193.32 <NA> dark matter is something that doesn 't like to interact very much <unk> except through gravity <unk> and of course we would like to learn more about it if you 're a particle physicist you want to know what happens <unk>
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 193.22 204.6 <NA> <unk> when we smash things together <unk> and dark matter is no exception <unk> well <unk> how do we do this to answer that question i 'm going to have to ask another one <unk> which is what happens when galaxy clusters collide 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 204.93 206.92 <NA> <unk> is an image <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 206.43 213.07 <NA> since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe scaled down versions <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 213.07 217.7 <NA> they are mostly made up of dark matter <unk> and that 's what you see in this bluish purple <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 217.49 225.2 <NA> the red represents the hot gas and of course you can see many galaxies <unk> what 's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge huge
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 225.88 238.31 <NA> <unk> and this is very important because what it means is that very very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature so 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 238.31 250.91 <NA> it 's very funny <unk> the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter <unk> the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small is precisely because they are so very big <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 251.2 254.19 <NA> fourth thing the physics of the very strange
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 254.78 262.39 <NA> <unk> certainly what i 've said so far is crazy <unk> okay <unk> if there 's anything stranger i think it has to be dark energy <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 262.39 266.31 <NA> if i throw a ball into the air <unk> i expect it to go up 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 265.85 270.27 <NA> what i don 't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 270.17 279.97 <NA> similarly cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding <unk> they don 't understand why it 's expanding at an ever increasing rate <unk> they give the cause
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 280.08 286.75 <NA> <unk> of this accelerated expansion a name <unk> and they call it dark energy and again we want to learn more about it 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 286.29 297.82 <NA> so one particular question that we have is how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales <unk> depending on how strong it is maybe structure forms faster or slower <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 297.66 304.85 <NA> well <unk> the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it 's horribly complicated <unk> here is a computer simulation
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 304.89 307.49 <NA> and we need a way to simplify it 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 307.24 311.04 <NA> well <unk> i like to think about this using an analogy <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 310.86 313.64 <NA> if i want to understand the sinking of the titanic <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 313.64 324.23 <NA> the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off <unk> the most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 323.8 325.26 <NA> <unk> similarly
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 325.31 334.77 <NA> <unk> i can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 334.28 336.03 <NA> <unk> so 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 335.66 348.18 <NA> as i come to a close you might feel slightly cheated <unk> i mean i began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful <unk> and i 've given some reasons <unk> but what is their use really <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 348.29 349.84 <NA> well to answer
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 350.85 360.61 <NA> <unk> i want to give you a quote by henry ford when he was asked about cars he had this to say if i had asked people what they wanted <unk> they would have said faster horses 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 360.81 365.63 <NA> today we as a society are faced with many many difficult problems <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 365.63 375.14 <NA> and the solutions to these problems are not obvious <unk> they are not faster horses <unk> they will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 376.18 378.76 <NA> <unk> we need to focus <unk> yes we need to concentrate <unk> 
HenryLin_2013Y 1 HenryLin_2013Y 378.77 393.12 <NA> but we also need to remember that innovation ingenuity <unk> inspiration these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out <unk> and i can 't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us
