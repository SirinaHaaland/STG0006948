AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 378.01 389.3 <NA> that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level 
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 389.77 397.07 <NA> it 's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches 
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 397.24 399.84 <NA> let me tell you that there 's not too many people interested in

AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 421.97 424.99 <NA> two thousand and six we 'd run through all
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 426.51 439.6 <NA> <unk> run through all the money i had and essentially we had no money left <unk> and we 'd convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies <unk> whatnot to delay their billing until december 
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 439.29 443.66 <NA> so we 'd racked up at this stage about six hundred thousand dollars worth of
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 443.43 452.9 <NA> debt <unk> so if movember two thousand and six didn 't happen the four founders <unk> well <unk> we would 've been broke <unk> we would 've been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches

AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 521.91 529.91 <NA> but he said we will partner with you <unk> but we 're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 529.92 540.5 <NA> so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country the u s and the u k and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely <unk>
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 540.4 550.17 <NA> <unk> more money globally than we could just in australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure and we 're not about finding an australian cure or a canadian
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 550.85 552.99 <NA> <unk> about finding the cure <unk> 
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 553.37 561.21 <NA> so in two thousand and seven <unk> we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 561.17 567.02 <NA> for the campaign it wasn 't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung ho with our success in australia
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 567.02 573.76 <NA> and new zealand at that stage <unk> so that year really taught us the importance of being patient
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 573.53 578.68 <NA> and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 580.11 590.92 <NA> <unk> but what i 'm really pleased to say is in two thousand and ten movember became a truly global movement canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world <unk> 
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 590.91 597.68 <NA> last year we had four hundred and fifty thousand mo bros spread across the world and together we raised

AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 775.85 783.79 <NA> <unk> now we always focus naturally on how much we raise because it 's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 783.58 790.3 <NA> is more important than the funds we raise because i know that is changing and saving lives today and it 's probably best exampled
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 790.3 799.42 <NA> by a young guy that i met at south by southwest in austin texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember

AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 851.18 854.07 <NA> <unk> so those conversations getting men engaged in this at
AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 853.87 860.67 <NA> whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise

AdamGarone_2011X 1 AdamGarone_2011X 900.04 907.28 <NA> <unk> so what we did was we created a global action plan and we 're taking ten percent of what 's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund and
