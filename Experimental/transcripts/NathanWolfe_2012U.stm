NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 34.97 45.51 <NA> and when i was in beloit wisconsin i gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students <unk> and i 'm here to tell you if there 's anything more intimidating than talking here at ted <unk>

NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 53.34 64.9 <NA> at the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions but there was one that 's really stuck with me since then there was a young girl who stood up and she asked the question where should we explore 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 64.67 70.33 <NA> i think there 's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on earth is over 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 70.33 78.04 <NA> that for the next generation they 're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 77.73 79.85 <NA> but is that really the case
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 79.9 84.41 <NA> is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on earth it
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 84.19 92.58 <NA> sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology this is an explorer of the unseen world martinus beijerinck <unk> 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 92.58 100.14 <NA> so beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease what he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 100 103.66 <NA> plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 103.66 111.88 <NA> and he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 111.67 119.19 <NA> bacteria at the time he came up with a name for his mystery agent he called it the virus

NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 121.04 129.88 <NA> and in uncovering viruses beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us we now know that viruses make up the majority of the
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 129.81 135.4 <NA> <unk> genetic information on our planet more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined <unk> 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 134.91 142.03 <NA> and obviously there 's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world things like the eradication of smallpox

NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 148.95 153.29 <NA> and beijerinck 's discovery this was not something that occurred five hundred years ago
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 154.87 165.77 <NA> <unk> over one hundred years ago that beijerinck discovered viruses <unk> so basically we had automobiles but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet <unk> 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 165.73 179.97 <NA> we now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world things like deep sequencing which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species <unk> but to look at entire

NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 194.78 199.56 <NA> in my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify

NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 200 206.41 <NA> causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them <unk> and just to give you a sense of how this works <unk> 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 206.04 213.7 <NA> imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you and this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 213.33 218.47 <NA> the first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information <unk> 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 218.47 225.14 <NA> and if we started looking into that genetic information we 'd see a number of usual suspects out there of course a lot of human genetic information
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 225.31 234.2 <NA> <unk> but also bacterial and viral information mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose <unk> but we 'd also see something very very surprising 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 233.83 246.69 <NA> as we started to look at this information we would see that about twenty percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn 't match anything that we 've ever seen before no plant animal fungus virus or bacteria <unk> 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 246.69 250.25 <NA> basically we have no clue what this is 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 250.09 254.91 <NA> and for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data a few of us
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 254.96 257.99 <NA> <unk> actually begun to call this information
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 257.99 266.4 <NA> biological dark matter we know it 's not anything that we 've seen before it 's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 265.97 270.33 <NA> right within our own genetic information <unk> and there 's a lot of it 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 270.33 279.97 <NA> if you think twenty percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter if we looked at your gut up to forty or fifty percent of that information is biological dark
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 280.66 290.53 <NA> and even in the relatively sterile blood around one to two percent of this information is dark matter can 't be classified can 't be typed or matched with anything we 've seen before 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 290.94 299.24 <NA> at first we thought that perhaps this was artifact these deep sequencing tools are relatively new but as they become more and more accurate we 've
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 299.06 304.94 <NA> determined that this information is a form of life or at least some of it is a form of life and
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 304.9 314.9 <NA> <unk> while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy there 's a very very exciting possibility that exists 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 314.5 316.56 <NA> that buried in this life
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 317.53 325.05 <NA> <unk> in this genetic information are signatures of as of yet unidentified life that as we explore these strings of
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 325.64 335.94 <NA> <unk> c 's and g 's we may uncover a completely new class of life that like beijerinck will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology that perhaps <unk>
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 335.84 345.87 <NA> <unk> will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren 't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology i
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 352.11 358.09 <NA> <unk> 're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life

NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 379.62 386.28 <NA> and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there but that doesn 't mean that there 's nothing left to explore on earth 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 386.28 395.39 <NA> beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers people like that young girl from beloit wisconsin <unk> 
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 395.23 404.97 <NA> and i think if we phrase that lesson it 's something like this don 't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story <unk> go after the dark matter
NathanWolfe_2012U 1 NathanWolfe_2012U 405.34 412.3 <NA> in whatever field you choose to explore there are unknowns all around us and they 're just waiting to be discovered
