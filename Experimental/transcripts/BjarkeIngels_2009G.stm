BjarkeIngels_2009G 1 BjarkeIngels_2009G 28.27 29.97 <NA> recently we asked ourselves
BjarkeIngels_2009G 1 BjarkeIngels_2009G 29.96 39.72 <NA> <unk> if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of

BjarkeIngels_2009G 1 BjarkeIngels_2009G 409.67 417.75 <NA> so that means that all one point three billion chinese have grown up with the emperor 's new clothes the matchstick girl and the little mermaid 
BjarkeIngels_2009G 1 BjarkeIngels_2009G 417.59 427.18 <NA> it 's almost like a fragment of danish culture integrated into chinese culture <unk> the biggest tourist attraction in china is the great wall the great wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon

BjarkeIngels_2009G 1 BjarkeIngels_2009G 467.14 475.02 <NA> we donate one thousand bikes to shanghai <unk> so if you come to the expo go straight to the danish pavilion get a danish bike and then continue

BjarkeIngels_2009G 1 BjarkeIngels_2009G 490.19 498.36 <NA> so we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda images statements but no real experience 
BjarkeIngels_2009G 1 BjarkeIngels_2009G 498.36 501.64 <NA> so just like with a bike we don 't talk about it you can try it

BjarkeIngels_2009G 1 BjarkeIngels_2009G 625.54 629.94 <NA> but to conclude if you want to see the mermaid from may to december next year
