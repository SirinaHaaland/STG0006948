MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 476.27 477.4 <NA> <unk> get shot down 
MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 477.22 484.6 <NA> so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds and the norden bombsight doesn 't work as well under those conditions <unk> 
MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 484.42 493.9 <NA> but most of all the norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target <unk> but of course what happens in real life 
MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 493.9 495.63 <NA> there are clouds 
MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 495.62 503.77 <NA> right it needs cloudless sky to be really accurate well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above central europe between

MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 508.59 519.16 <NA> and then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the norden bombsight was there was a famous case in one thousand nine hundred and forty four where the allies bombed a chemical plant in leuna germany <unk> and the chemical <unk>

MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 567.25 574.87 <NA> that carl norden as a proper swiss was very enamored of german engineers <unk> so in the 1930s he hired a whole bunch of them 
MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 578.04 587.65 <NA> <unk> gave a complete set of the plans for the norden bombsight to the nazis so they had their own norden bombsight throughout the entire war which also by the way didn 't work very well 
MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 589.41 592.39 <NA> so why do we talk about the norden bombsight <unk> 
MalcolmGladwell_2011G 1 MalcolmGladwell_2011G 592.38 598.21 <NA> well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of norden bombsights
