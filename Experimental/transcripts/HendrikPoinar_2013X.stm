HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 94.93 101.52 <NA> <unk> by deep time because elephants like us share their origins in africa some seven million years ago <unk> 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 104.84 110.16 <NA> <unk> actually like the elephants migrated out into europe and asia <unk> 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 109.82 119.88 <NA> so the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis which was standing four meters tall weighing about ten tons and was a woodland adapted species <unk>

HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 192.44 199.89 <NA> <unk> off of siberia and alaska until about three thousand years ago <unk> so egyptians are building pyramids and woollies are still living on islands <unk>

HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 208.52 218.38 <NA> dense forests that are migrating north and also as the late great paul martin once put it probably pleistocene overkill so the large game hunters that took them down 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 217.89 226.52 <NA> fortunately we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in siberia and alaska and we can actually go up there
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 226.36 229.97 <NA> and actually take them out and the preservation is again like
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 229.96 232.43 <NA> <unk> those insects in [ amber ] phenomenal <unk> 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 231.94 241.4 <NA> so you have teeth bones with blood which look like blood you have hair and you have intact carcasses or heads which still have brains in them <unk> 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 241.72 254.97 <NA> so the preservation and the survival of dna depends on many factors and i have to admit most of which we still don 't quite understand but depending upon when an organism dies and how quickly he 's buried the depth of that burial
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 255.34 264.01 <NA> the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment will ultimately dictate how long dna will survive over geologically meaningful time frames and it
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 264.01 275.04 <NA> 's probably surprising to many of you sitting in this room that it 's not the time that matters it 's not the length of preservation it 's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 274.67 279.97 <NA> so if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 280.79 291.11 <NA> the dna which was once intact tightly wrapped around histone proteins is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 291.06 299.96 <NA> <unk> so those bacteria along with the environmental bacteria <unk> free water and oxygen actually break apart the dna into smaller and smaller and smaller dna
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 300.46 307.76 <NA> <unk> until all you have are fragments that range from ten base pairs to in the best case scenarios a few hundred base pairs in length 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 307.42 312.99 <NA> so most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 312.99 320.63 <NA> but a few of them actually have dna fragments that survive for thousands <unk> even a few millions of years in time

HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 325.85 335.88 <NA> <unk> away from all the rest of the gunk in there and it 's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if i take a mammoth bone or a tooth and i extract its dna that i 'll get mammoth dna 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 335.42 346.98 <NA> but i 'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth and more complicated i 'll get all the dna that survived in that environment with it so the bacteria the fungi and so on and so forth 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 346.88 354.97 <NA> not surprising then again that a mammoth preserved in the permafrost will have something on the order of fifty percent of its dna being mammoth whereas something like
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 354.96 362.65 <NA> <unk> the columbian mammoth living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment over its laying in will only have three to ten percent endogenous <unk> 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 362.73 374.45 <NA> but we 've come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate <unk> capture and discriminate the mammoth from the non mammoth dna and with the advances in high throughput sequencing we can actually pull out and
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 376.48 380.39 <NA> <unk> all these small mammoth fragments and place them onto a backbone
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 380.22 388.93 <NA> of an asian or african elephant chromosome <unk> and so by doing that we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an asian elephant 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 388.94 395.24 <NA> and what do we know then about a mammoth well <unk> the mammoth genome is almost at full completion <unk> 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 394.84 404.97 <NA> and we know that it 's actually really big it 's mammoth <unk> so a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs but an elephant and mammoth genome is about two billion base pairs larger
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 404.99 413.01 <NA> <unk> and most of that is composed of small repetitive dnas that make it very difficult to actually re jig the entire structure of the genome 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 412.64 422.01 <NA> so having this information allows us to answer one of the interesting relationship questions between mammoths and their living relatives the african and the asian elephant 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 421.55 429.94 <NA> all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago <unk> but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share a most recent common ancestor with asian elephants about
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 429.93 433.39 <NA> <unk> six million years ago so slightly closer to the asian elephant 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 433.16 445.33 <NA> with advances in ancient dna technology we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that i mentioned and i just wanted to talk about two of them the woolly and the columbian mammoth 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 445.33 449.36 <NA> both of which were living very close to each other
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 450.4 464.93 <NA> <unk> so when the glaciers were massive in north america <unk> the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones and came into contact with the relatives living to the south <unk> and there they shared refugia <unk> and a little bit more than the refugia it turns out it looks like they were interbreeding 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 464.8 475.08 <NA> and that this is not an uncommon feature in proboscideans because it turns out that large savanna male elephants will outcompete the smaller forest elephants for their females 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 476 482.01 <NA> <unk> hairless columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies it reminds me a bit of high school unfortunately 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 483.56 497.91 <NA> so this is not trivial given the idea that we want to revive extinct species because it turns out that an african and an asian elephant can actually interbreed and have live young and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo in chester u k in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 497.78 500.17 <NA> so that means that we can actually take asian
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 500.13 508.61 <NA> <unk> elephant chromosomes modify them into all those positions we 've actually now been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome we can put that into an enucleated cell 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 508.43 518.74 <NA> differentiate that into a stem cell subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm artificially inseminate an asian elephant egg <unk> and over a long and arduous procedure <unk>
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 518.69 524.9 <NA> actually bring back something that looks like this now this wouldn 't be an exact replica because the short
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 525 532.91 <NA> dna fragments that i told you about will prevent us from building the exact structure but it would make something that looked and felt very much like a woolly mammoth did 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 533.77 535.74 <NA> now when i bring up this
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 535.41 539.08 <NA> with my friends we often talk about well where would you put it where are
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 538.92 549.32 <NA> you going to house a mammoth there 's no climates or habitats suitable well that 's not actually the case it turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of siberia and yukon <unk>
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 549.22 554.97 <NA> <unk> that actually could house a mammoth remember this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 555.13 559.58 <NA> <unk> so this landscape would be easily able to house it and i have to admit
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 559.36 567.47 <NA> that there [ is ] a part of the child in me the boy in me that would love to see these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost of the north once again <unk> 
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 567.47 571.33 <NA> but i do have to admit that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 571.09 574.12 <NA> whether or not we should <unk> thank you very much
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 581.46 590.34 <NA> <unk> you 've left us with a question i 'm sure everyone is asking this when you say should we it feels like you 're reticent there and yet you 've
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 590.35 596.56 <NA> given us a vision of it being so possible what 's your reticence hendrik poinar i don 't think it 's reticence i think it 's just that
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 596.85 604.67 <NA> we have to think very deeply about the implications ramifications of our actions <unk> and so as long as we have good deep discussion like we 're having now
HendrikPoinar_2013X 1 HendrikPoinar_2013X 605.02 611.58 <NA> <unk> think we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it but i just want to make sure that we spend time thinking about why we 're doing it first
