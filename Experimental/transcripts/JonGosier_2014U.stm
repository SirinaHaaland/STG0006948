JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 13.69 20.48 <NA> <unk> as a software developer and technologist i 've worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years <unk> 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 20.26 29.97 <NA> civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good using technology to solve humanitarian problems this is in two thousand and ten in uganda working

JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 51.33 55.96 <NA> <unk> but over the years as i have thought about these technologies and the things that i work on 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 55.62 59.05 <NA> a question kind of nags in the back of my mind which is 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 58.71 67.42 <NA> what if we 're wrong about the virtues of technology and if it sometimes actively hurts the communities that we 're intending to help 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 67.11 71.87 <NA> the tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 71.69 79.49 <NA> if we build great things it will positively affect everyone <unk> eventually these innovations will get out and find everyone
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 80.26 85.88 <NA> <unk> but that 's not always the case i like to call this this blind championing of technology
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 87.42 89.09 <NA> to borrow a phrase 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 89.26 98.93 <NA> laughter we tend to think that if we design things for the select few eventually those technologies will reach everyone <unk> and that 's not always the case technology and innovation
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 98.53 104.22 <NA> behaves a lot like wealth and capital they tend to consolidate in the hands of the few
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 104.81 111.66 <NA> <unk> sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many <unk> and so most of you aren 't tackling
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 111.23 119.5 <NA> oppressive regimes on the weekends so i wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable in the world of wearables and smartphones
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 119.5 121.99 <NA> and apps 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 121.76 129.25 <NA> there 's a big movement to track people 's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you 're sitting
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 130.13 131.4 <NA> <unk> 're sitting too much or
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 131.18 132.94 <NA> walking enough 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 132.99 139.75 <NA> these technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 139.68 143.69 <NA> <unk> and in turn these medical facilities are starting to expect
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 143.51 146.89 <NA> these types of efficiencies as these digital
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 146.85 150.14 <NA> tools find their way into medical rooms and they become digitally
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 150.55 152.99 <NA> <unk> what happens to the digitally invisible 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 152.59 161.9 <NA> what does the medical experience look like for someone who doesn 't have the $ four hundred phone or watch tracking their every movement do they now become a burden
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 161.62 165.17 <NA> on the medical system is their experience changed 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 165.82 172.31 <NA> in the world of finance bitcoin and crypto currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 172 178.44 <NA> but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high right you need access to the same
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 178.26 179.67 <NA> phones devices
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 179.6 188.31 <NA> <unk> connectivity <unk> and even where you don 't where you can find a proxy agent usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate <unk> 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 188.6 197.91 <NA> and so the question that i ask myself is what happens to the last community using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency <unk> 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 199.82 204.85 <NA> another example from my hometown in philadelphia <unk> i recently went to the public library
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 204.81 212.23 <NA> <unk> there and they are facing an existential crisis public funding is dwindling they have to reduce their footprint to stay
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 212.03 220.12 <NA> open and stay relevant <unk> and so one of the ways they 're going about this is digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 220.44 229.91 <NA> this is great for most kids right you can check out books from home you can research on the way to school or from school but these are really two big assumptions that one
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 229.9 233.52 <NA> <unk> you have access at home and two that you have access to a mobile phone 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 233.52 240.83 <NA> and in philadelphia <unk> many kids do not so what does their education experience look like in the wake of
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 240.52 248 <NA> a completely <unk> cloud based library what used to be considered such a basic part of education how do they stay competitive 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 248.98 254.97 <NA> a final example from across the world in east africa there 's been a huge
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 254.9 258.6 <NA> <unk> movement to digitize land ownership rights
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 258.14 271.33 <NA> for a number of reasons migrant communities <unk> older generations dying off and ultimately poor record keeping have led to conflicts over who owns what <unk> and so there was a big movement to
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 271.12 279.82 <NA> put all this information online to track all the ownership of of these plots of land put them in the cloud and give them to the communities
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 279.86 284.27 <NA> but actually the unintended consequence of this has been that
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 284.27 291.74 <NA> venture capitalists <unk> investors <unk> real estate developers have swooped in and they 've begun buying up these plots of land right out from under
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 291.51 294.92 <NA> these communities because they have access to the technologies
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 294.68 304.37 <NA> and the connectivity that makes that possible so that 's the common thread that connects these examples the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 304.96 311 <NA> <unk> as engineers as technologists we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 311 315.86 <NA> we think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 315.64 325.02 <NA> this needs to change we have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live in the late
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 325.76 335.73 <NA> <unk> a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking i think in two thousand and fourteen we 're long overdue for a similar movement in the area of tech
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 335.42 337.83 <NA> and technology <unk> 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 337.85 345.57 <NA> so i just encourage you as you are all thinking about the next big thing as entrepreneurs as ceos <unk> as
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 345.2 353.61 <NA> engineers as makers that you think about the unintended consequences of the things that you 're building <unk> 
JonGosier_2014U 1 JonGosier_2014U 353.18 357.7 <NA> because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone <unk> thank you
