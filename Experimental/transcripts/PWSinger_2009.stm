PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 917.65 920.54 <NA> and do not believe that that isn 't coming 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 920.11 925.49 <NA> during my research i came across four different pentagon projects on different aspects of that <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 925.39 929.82 <NA> and so you have this question what does this lead to issues like war crimes
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 930.08 938.46 <NA> <unk> robots are emotionless so they don 't get upset if their buddy is killed <unk> they don 't commit crimes of rage and revenge <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 938.36 941.82 <NA> but robots are emotionless 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 941.69 948.81 <NA> they see an 80 year old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a t 80 tank <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 948.32 952.38 <NA> they 're both just a series of zeroes and ones <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 952.13 954.94 <NA> and so we have this question to figure out
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 954.98 964.96 <NA> how do we catch up our 20th century laws of war <unk> that are so old right now that they could qualify for medicare to these 21st century technologies <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 965.55 967.82 <NA> and so in conclusion 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 967.82 977.48 <NA> i 've talked about what seems the future of war <unk> but notice that i 've only used real world examples and you 've only seen real world pictures and videos <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 977.26 979.76 <NA> and so this sets a great challenge for all of us
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 979.93 989.93 <NA> <unk> that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your roomba sucking the life away from you are we going to let the fact that what 's unveiling itself right now in war
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 989.77 994.46 <NA> sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 994.39 1004 <NA> are we going to face the reality of 21st century war is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1003.6 1004.91 <NA> and not deal
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1004.99 1008.9 <NA> <unk> the issues that surround it until pandora 's box is already opened up 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1009.19 1017.99 <NA> now <unk> i could be wrong on this and one pentagon robot scientist told me that i was he said there 's no real social ethical <unk> moral issues when it comes to robots 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1018.01 1023.36 <NA> that is he added unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1025.58 1028.47 <NA> <unk> then it 's just a product recall issue 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1029.15 1035.19 <NA> and so the ending point for this is that actually <unk> we can turn to hollywood 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1035.33 1044.85 <NA> a few years ago hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top one hundred heroes and top one hundred villains of all of hollywood history 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1044.48 1049.02 <NA> the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1048.83 1052.71 <NA> only one character made it onto both lists <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1053.24 1054.49 <NA> the terminator
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1054.93 1056.71 <NA> <unk> a robot killing machine <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1056.25 1065.68 <NA> and so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil <unk> but for me it points to the fact that there 's a duality of humans as well <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1066.18 1077.65 <NA> this week is a celebration of our creativity our creativity has taken our species to the stars our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love <unk> 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1077.52 1080 <NA> and now we 're using our creativity
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1080.08 1088.97 <NA> <unk> in a certain direction to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities <unk> maybe even one day an entirely new species 
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1089.62 1092.93 <NA> but one of the main reasons that we 're doing that
PWSinger_2009 1 PWSinger_2009 1092.47 1101.85 <NA> is because of our drive to destroy each other <unk> and so the question we all should ask is it our machines or is it us that 's wired for war
