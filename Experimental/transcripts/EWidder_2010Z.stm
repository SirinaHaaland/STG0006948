EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 28.61 35.84 <NA> my addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called wasp that 's not an acronym just somebody thought it looked like the insect
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 35.84 41.97 <NA> it was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of two thousand feet
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 41.6 50.43 <NA> right after i completed my ph d i was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that were using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 50.06 54.94 <NA> we trained in a tank in port hueneme and then my first open ocean dive
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 55.08 57.13 <NA> <unk> was in santa barbara channel
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 56.79 62.96 <NA> it was an evening dive i went down to a depth of eight hundred and eighty feet and turned out the lights
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 62.96 70.03 <NA> and the reason i turned out the lights is because i knew i would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 69.57 75.97 <NA> but i was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 75.96 79.91 <NA> i saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 79.87 87.35 <NA> <unk> longer than this room pumping out so much light that i could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 92.26 103.58 <NA> and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire but these were icy blue embers it was breathtaking
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 103.18 104.97 <NA> now usually if people are familiar with
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 104.93 112.72 <NA> <unk> bioluminescence at all it 's these guys it 's fireflies and there are a few other land dwellers that can make light some insects earthworms fungi
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 112.72 115.92 <NA> but in general on land it 's really rare
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 115.55 119.46 <NA> in the ocean it 's the rule rather than the exception
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 119.09 126.51 <NA> if i go out in the open ocean environment virtually anywhere in the world and i drag a net from three thousand to the surface

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 134.22 138.04 <NA> this makes for some pretty spectacular light shows
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 137.58 147.11 <NA> now i want to share with you a little video that i shot from a submersible i first developed this technique working from a little single person submersible called deep rover
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 147.11 150.11 <NA> and then adapted it for use on the johnson sea link which you see

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 150.63 165.54 <NA> so mounted in front of the observation sphere there 's a a three foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it and inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that 's about as sensitive as a fully dark adapted human eye albeit a little fuzzy
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 165.54 179.91 <NA> so you turn on the camera turn out the lights that sparkle you 're seeing is not luminescence that 's just electronic noise on these intensified cameras you don 't see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water but as it does animals bumping into the screen are
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 179.87 181.83 <NA> <unk> stimulated to bioluminesc
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 181.52 195.88 <NA> now when i was first doing this all i was trying to do was count the number of sources i knew my forward speed i knew the area so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter but i started to realize that i could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 195.88 205 <NA> and so here in the gulf of maine at seven hundred and forty feet i can name pretty much everything you 're seeing there to the species level like those big explosions
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 205.28 214.51 <NA> sparks are from a little comb jelly and there 's krill and other kinds of crustaceans and jellyfish there was one of those comb jellies
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 214.08 219.1 <NA> and so i 've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 219.09 225.2 <NA> recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the x y z coordinate of the initial impact

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 231.01 242.95 <NA> but you don 't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this you can actually see it in surface waters this is a video shot by doctor mike latz at scripps institution of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 242.95 253.34 <NA> and this isn 't someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in puerto rico this was actually shot in san diego harbor and sometimes you can see it even closer than that because
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 252.97 254.85 <NA> the heads on ships that 's

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 271.19 279.73 <NA> so how does a living creature make light well that was the question nineteenth century french physiologist raphael dubois asked about this bioluminescent clam
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 279.99 287.17 <NA> <unk> he ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals one the enzyme he called luciferase the substrate he called luciferin

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 296 304.97 <NA> in fact most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 335.3 348.66 <NA> another thing all these molecules are telling us is apparently bioluminescence has evolved at least forty times maybe as many as fifty separate times in evolutionary history which is a clear indication of how
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 348.23 354.76 <NA> spectacularly important this trait is for survival so what is it about bioluminescence that 's so
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 355.14 356.77 <NA> <unk> to so many animals
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 356.34 360.68 <NA> well for animals that are trying to avoid predators by
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 360.47 367.46 <NA> staying in the darkness light can still be very useful for the three basic things animals have to do to survive
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 367.28 371.78 <NA> and that 's find food attract a mate and avoid being eaten
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 371.78 379.97 <NA> so for example this fish has a built in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate and then when it 's not
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 379.99 384.86 <NA> <unk> using it it actually can roll it down in its head just like the headlights on your lamborghini

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 387.91 395.27 <NA> and this fish which is one of my favorites has three headlights on each side of its head now this one is blue
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 395.27 405 <NA> and that 's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication so most animals
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 405.16 413.79 <NA> make blue light and most animals can only see blue light but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 413.79 422.11 <NA> and i have no idea why there 's two and that 's something i want to solve some day so not only can it see blue light but it can see red light
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 421.88 429.91 <NA> so it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper 's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and will be able to see

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 431.52 442.42 <NA> it 's also got a little chin barble here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off and a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 442.29 445.7 <NA> this is another one of my favorite fish this is a viperfish
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 445.7 453.04 <NA> and it 's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 452.64 454.97 <NA> the teeth on this fish are so long
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 455.22 460.43 <NA> that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish it would actually impale its own brain
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 460 464.04 <NA> so instead it slides in grooves on the outside of the head
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 463.86 473.99 <NA> this is a christmas tree of a fish everything on this fish lights up it 's not just that lure it 's got built in flashlight it 's got these jewel like <unk>
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 473.89 479.07 <NA> <unk> light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 494.93 505 <NA> and we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to pixar and i 'm very grateful to pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people i do wish with their budget that they might
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 505.02 514.9 <NA> <unk> have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor starving graduate student who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that 's been preserved in formalin
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 514.65 517.48 <NA> these are the eyes of a living angler fish
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 517.28 526.45 <NA> so she 's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 526.45 529.88 <NA> and this one has a lure with all kinds of
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 530.02 536.99 <NA> <unk> interesting threads coming off it now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 536.99 543.05 <NA> but then stomach content analysis on these fish done by scientists or more likely their graduate students
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 542.77 546.38 <NA> have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 546.37 555 <NA> so now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the angler fish world because many of these males are what are known

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 610.48 615.99 <NA> so they can use it for finding food for attracting mates they use it a lot for defense many different ways
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 615.99 624.96 <NA> a lot of them can release their luciferin their luferase in the water just like a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud this shrimp is actually spewing light out
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 625 636.66 <NA> <unk> its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness and there 's a lot of different animals that can do this there 's jellyfish there 's squid

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 638.79 653.38 <NA> there 's even fish that can do this this fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light and i was luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of africa for blue planet
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 654.93 658.9 <NA> <unk> for the deep portion of blue planet and we were using a special trawling net that
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 658.44 667.21 <NA> we were able to bring these animals up alive so we captured one of these and i brought it into the lab so i 'm holding it and i 'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 666.9 670.45 <NA> and when i do you 'll see bioluminescence coming out
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 671.25 679.97 <NA> but to me what 's shocking is not just the amount of light but the fact that it 's not just luciferin and luciferates for this fish it 's actually whole cells

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 767 774.96 <NA> the primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships and i defy you to name any other branch of

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 777.77 785.4 <NA> the other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote operated vehicles i 've made hundreds of dives in submersibles

EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 916.29 929.07 <NA> and so the place that we took it to was this place called a brine pool which is in the northern part of the gulf of mexico it 's a magical place and i know this footage isn 't going to look like anything to you we had a crummy camera at the time
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 928.83 929.88 <NA> but i was
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 929.81 940.17 <NA> <unk> ecstatic we 're at the edge of the brine pool there 's a fish that 's swimming towards the camera it 's clearly undisturbed by us and i had my window into the deep <unk>
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 940.07 947.19 <NA> <unk> see i for the first time could see what animals were doing down there when we weren 't down there disturbing them in some way
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 954.72 959.53 <NA> <unk> seconds after it went into its pinwheel display we recorded this
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 959.73 967.99 <NA> this is a squid over six feet long that is so new to science it cannot be placed in any known scientific family
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 967.77 978.2 <NA> i could not have asked for a better proof of concept and based on this i went back to the national science foundation and said this is what we will discover and they gave me enough money to do it right
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 978.2 980 <NA> which has involved developing
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 980.02 987.81 <NA> <unk> the world 's first deep sea webcam which has been installed in the monterey canyon for the past year and now more recently a
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 987.81 991.52 <NA> modular form of this system a much more mobile form
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 991.21 1005 <NA> that 's a lot easier to launch and recover that i hope can be used on sylvia 's hope spots to help explore and protect these areas and for me learn more about the bioluminescence in these hope spots
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 1005.19 1009.5 <NA> so one of these take home messages here is
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 1009.01 1017.99 <NA> there is still a lot to explore in the oceans and sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what 's in them and she 's right
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 1017.86 1022.52 <NA> so if you ever ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible
EWidder_2010Z 1 EWidder_2010Z 1022.52 1028.02 <NA> say yes a thousand times yes and please turn out the lights i promise you
