LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 41.9 50.02 <NA> and the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing or 3d printing
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 51.72 53.65 <NA> <unk> this is a 3d printer <unk> 
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 53.16 59.81 <NA> they have been around for almost thirty years now which is quite amazing to think of but

LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 63.78 73.09 <NA> and typically you would take data like the data of a pen here <unk> which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3d 
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 72.6 79.88 <NA> and we would pass that data with material into a machine and a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 79.81 88.4 <NA> <unk> product would be built <unk> and we can take out the physical product and ready to use or to perhaps assemble into something else <unk> 
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 88.51 93.3 <NA> but if these machines have been around for almost thirty years why don 't we know about them
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 93.13 95.24 <NA> because typically they 've been
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 95.11 104.37 <NA> too inefficient <unk> inaccessible they 've not been fast enough they 've been quite expensive but today
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 104.92 117.36 <NA> becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful many barriers are breaking down that means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines if not this minute
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 118.22 126.99 <NA> and it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and most certainly our lives our businesses and the lives of our children <unk> 
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 126.77 128.44 <NA> so how does it work
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 130.29 141.84 <NA> <unk> it typically reads cad data <unk> which is a product design data created on professional product design programs and here you can see an engineer it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 141.84 150.02 <NA> create a product in 3d and this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into

LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 152.34 155.78 <NA> all the way through almost like slicing it like salami 
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 156.01 168.08 <NA> and that data layer by layer gets passed through the machine starting at the base of the product and depositing material layer upon layer infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 168.04 174.99 <NA> in an additive process <unk> and this material that 's deposited either starts as a liquid

LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 177.92 191.4 <NA> and the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting in this case we can see a laser sintering machine developed by eos it 's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer 
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 191.12 199.65 <NA> and over time quite rapidly actually in a number of hours we can build a physical product ready to take out of the machine and use <unk> 
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 199.4 204.97 <NA> and this is quite an extraordinary idea <unk> but it is reality today
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 205.25 214.79 <NA> <unk> so all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way <unk> they were all 3d printed <unk> and
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 214.61 222.55 <NA> you can see they 're ranging from shoes <unk> rings that were made out of stainless steal <unk> phone covers out of plastic

LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 294.57 304.52 <NA> created depositing layers of about four microns <unk> so really the resolution is quite incredible the detail that you can get today
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 304.81 312.8 <NA> <unk> is quite amazing so who 's using it typically because we can create products very rapidly
LisaHarouni_2011S 1 LisaHarouni_2011S 312.64 317.88 <NA> it 's been used by product designers or anyone who wanted to prototype a product
