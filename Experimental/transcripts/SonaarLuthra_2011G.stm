SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 16.12 26.04 <NA> <unk> cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over fifty years last october there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 26.04 28.23 <NA> and how bad the situation would get
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 29.99 31.89 <NA> <unk> knowing where help was needed
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 31.46 37.29 <NA> always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 37.34 45.19 <NA> we 've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 45.19 47.79 <NA> but we still can 't do that with water 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 47.42 54.55 <NA> and here 's why right now if you want to test water in the field you need a trained technician expensive equipment like this
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 54.9 64 <NA> <unk> and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results <unk> it 's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 63.8 73.21 <NA> before they change too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing and it ignores the fact that in the meanwhile people still need to drink water 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 73.23 77.42 <NA> most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 77.26 79.85 <NA> didn 't come from testing water <unk> it came from
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 79.78 84.2 <NA> <unk> forms like this which documented all the people we failed to help 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 84.94 92.39 <NA> countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they 're safe 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 92.16 98.63 <NA> i 've been inspired by that simplicity as i 've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people i 've ever known 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 98.63 104.61 <NA> we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 105.22 109.11 <NA> 's in its early stages <unk> but this is what it looks like right now <unk> 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 109.79 118.32 <NA> we call it the water canary it 's a fast <unk> cheap device that answers an important question is this water contaminated 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 118.34 124.99 <NA> it doesn 't require any special training and instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place <unk>
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 127.05 133.28 <NA> <unk> that means there 's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place no need to use reagents that can run out
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 133.1 136.96 <NA> and no need to be an expert to get actionable information 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 137.01 147.07 <NA> to test water <unk> you simply insert a sample and within seconds it either displays a red light <unk> indicating contaminated water <unk> or a green light indicating the sample is safe 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 146.88 151.24 <NA> this will make it possible for anyone to collect life saving information
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 150.75 153.77 <NA> and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 155.17 162.33 <NA> <unk> we 're also on top of that integrating wireless networking into an affordable device
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 162.12 170.3 <NA> with gps and gsm what that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 170.02 174.72 <NA> with enough users maps like this will make it possible to take preventive
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 175.76 180.81 <NA> <unk> containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 180.5 187.23 <NA> and then instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most it can happen automatically <unk> 
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 187.1 190.96 <NA> we 've seen how distributed networks big data
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 190.48 199.69 <NA> and information can transform society <unk> i think it 's time for us to apply them to water <unk> our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field
SonaarLuthra_2011G 1 SonaarLuthra_2011G 199.69 206.62 <NA> and to open source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation so we can tackle this problem together <unk> thank you
