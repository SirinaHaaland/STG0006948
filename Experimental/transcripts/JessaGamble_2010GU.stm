JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 18.4 29.94 <NA> life evolved under conditions of light and darkness light and then darkness and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in

JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 38.27 46.98 <NA> 'll give you an example if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach and you fly it all the way across the continent and you drop it into a sloped cage
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 46.98 55 <NA> it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores and it 'll skitter down again right as the

JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 63.12 73.9 <NA> and it 's incredible to watch but there 's nothing psychic or paranormal going on it 's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond usually with what 's going on around it
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 74.91 79.94 <NA> so we have this ability as well and in humans we call it the body clock
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 80.44 88.19 <NA> you can see this most clearly when you take away someone 's watch and you shut them into a bunker deep underground for a couple of months
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 88.06 94.23 <NA> people actually volunteer for this and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 94.23 99.87 <NA> so no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be they all show the same thing they get up just a

JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 107.34 113.97 <NA> and so in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks rather than somehow sensing the day outside
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 113.87 121.29 <NA> so fine we have a body clock and it turns out that it 's incredibly important in our lives it 's a huge driver for culture
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 121.28 125.46 <NA> and i think that it 's the most underrated force on our behavior
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 127.13 129.85 <NA> we evolved as a species near the
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 129.75 135.08 <NA> <unk> equator and so we 're very well equipped to deal with twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of darkness
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 134.9 145.18 <NA> but of course we 've spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada where i live we have perpetual daylight in summer and twenty four hours of darkness in winter so the culture <unk>

JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 170.05 179.97 <NA> well it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all they sleep twice every night they go to bed around
JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 180.07 181.8 <NA> eight zero pm

JessaGamble_2010GU 1 JessaGamble_2010GU 187.36 192.63 <NA> and in between they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed
