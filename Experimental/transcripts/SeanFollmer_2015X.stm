SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 27.26 31.2 <NA> <unk> over the years tools have become more and more specialized 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 30.77 44.67 <NA> these sculpting tools have evolved through their use <unk> and each one has a different form which matches its function <unk> and they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 44.84 49.72 <NA> but as tools have become more and more complex we need more complex
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 52.68 65.35 <NA> <unk> and so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you 're attending to other things such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 65.4 72.37 <NA> but the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 72.37 79.97 <NA> so it can do a million different things and run a million different applications <unk> however computers have the same static physical
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 80.08 90.41 <NA> <unk> form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well <unk> and i believe that this is fundamentally a problem because it doesn 't really allow us to interact <unk>
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 90.36 95.39 <NA> with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 104.81 113.55 <NA> <unk> physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways <unk> and so that 's what i 've been doing at the mit media lab and now at stanford <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 113.42 118.78 <NA> so with my colleagues <unk> daniel leithinger and hiroshi ishii we created inform 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 118.78 123.72 <NA> where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 123.23 129.94 <NA> or you can visualize 3d information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 135.36 142.87 <NA> or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 145.95 154.76 <NA> or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand and the idea is that for each individual application the physical form
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 155.02 156.98 <NA> <unk> matched to the application <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 156.78 162.95 <NA> and i believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information by making it physical 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 162.75 165.6 <NA> so the question is how can we use this
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 165.6 179.97 <NA> traditionally urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them <unk> so with tony tang at the media lab <unk> we created an interface built on inform to allow urban planners to design and view
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 180.13 189.41 <NA> entire cities and now you can walk around it <unk> but it 's dynamic it 's physical <unk> and you can also interact directly or you can look at different views <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 189.42 194.07 <NA> such as population or traffic information <unk> but it 's made physical <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 194.48 199.75 <NA> we also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 200 212.98 <NA> <unk> remotely collaborate with people so when we 're working together in person i 'm not only looking at your face but i 'm also gesturing and manipulating objects and that 's really hard to do when you 're using tools like skype
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 213.24 226.67 <NA> <unk> and so using inform you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance <unk> so we used the pins of the display to represent people 's hands <unk> allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 230.47 240.71 <NA> <unk> and you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3d data sets as well so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them and that allows people to collaborate on <unk>
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 240.61 246.95 <NA> <unk> these new types of 3d information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 250.58 261.36 <NA> <unk> and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other or you can have an object that 's linked between two places so as i move a ball on one side the ball moves on the other as well <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 261.74 268.71 <NA> and so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth sensing camera like a microsoft kinect 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 268.25 275.47 <NA> now you might be wondering how does this all work and essentially what it is is nine hundred linear actuators
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 275.31 279.97 <NA> that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 280.17 287.32 <NA> <unk> in these pins above <unk> so it 's not that complex compared to what 's going on at cern <unk> but it did take a long time for us to build it 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 287.32 291.55 <NA> and so we started with a single motor a single linear actuator <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 291.3 304.97 <NA> and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them and then we had to make a lot of them and so the problem with having nine hundred of something is that you have to do every step nine hundred times <unk> and so that meant that we
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 304.93 307.26 <NA> <unk> had a lot of work to do so we sort of set up a
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 308.61 314.06 <NA> the media lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do research laughter
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 314.32 321.05 <NA> and had late nights watching movies eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws you know research 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 321.85 329.88 <NA> laughter but anyway <unk> i think that we were really excited by the things that inform allowed us to do increasingly we 're using mobile devices
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 329.96 334.24 <NA> <unk> we interact on the go <unk> but mobile devices just like computers 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 334.03 344.49 <NA> are used for so many different applications so you use them to talk on the phone to surf the web to play games to take pictures or even a million different things <unk> but again they have <unk>
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 344.39 350.08 <NA> <unk> the same static physical form for each of these applications <unk> and so we wanted to know how
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 350 359.82 <NA> we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inform and bring them to mobile devices <unk> so at stanford we created this haptic edge display <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 359.82 369.05 <NA> which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape so you can feel in your hand where you are as you 're reading a book <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 368.81 379.34 <NA> or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 380.8 385.58 <NA> or you can play games and have actual buttons <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 385.27 396.53 <NA> and so we were able to do this by embedding forty small tiny linear actuators inside the device and that allow you not only to touch them but also back drive them as well <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 396.37 404.97 <NA> but we 've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change so we 've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 405.02 411 <NA> <unk> from something that looks a lot like a phone to a wristband on the go <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 411.23 415.45 <NA> and so together with ken nakagaki at the media lab we created this new
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 430.41 444.79 <NA> <unk> we 're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use <unk> so you can make something like a game controller <unk> and then the system will understand what shape it 's in and change to that mode 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 445.53 450.02 <NA> so where does this point how do we move forward from here i think
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 450.61 462.47 <NA> <unk> where we are today is in this new age of the internet of things where we have computers everywhere they 're in our pockets they 're in our walls <unk> they 're in almost every device that you 'll buy in the next five years <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 462.01 472.7 <NA> but what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments <unk> and so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart <unk>
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 472.65 479.58 <NA> environments or cities that can adapt to us physically and allow us to do new new ways of
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 480.26 487.74 <NA> <unk> with people and doing new types of tasks so for the milan design week <unk> we created transform which is an interactive <unk>
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 488.93 498.33 <NA> <unk> table scale version of these shape displays which can move physical objects on the surface for example reminding you to take your keys <unk> but it can also transform
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 497.93 499.96 <NA> to fit different ways of
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 500.58 509.8 <NA> <unk> so if you want to work then it can change to sort of set up your work system and so as you bring a device over it creates all the affordances you need
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 509.64 514.93 <NA> and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 516.66 525.1 <NA> so in conclusion i really think that we need to think about a new fundamentally different way of interacting with computers 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 525.03 529.97 <NA> we need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 529.9 531.11 <NA> <unk> use them
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 530.62 540.38 <NA> and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical <unk> 
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 540.16 550.37 <NA> but looking forward i think we need to go beyond this beyond devices to really think about new ways that we can bring people together and bring our information into <unk>
SeanFollmer_2015X 1 SeanFollmer_2015X 550.27 557.52 <NA> <unk> the world and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically <unk> so with that i will leave you thank you very much
