DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 12.79 19.28 <NA> <unk> i 'm a neuroscientist <unk> and in neuroscience we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 18.88 24.93 <NA> but i want to start with the easiest question and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 25 32.85 <NA> <unk> a fundamental question if we want to understand brain function <unk> and that is why do we and other animals have brains 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 32.6 39.51 <NA> not all species on our planet have brains so if we want to know what the brain is for let 's think about why we evolved one 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 39.11 45.48 <NA> now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think <unk> and that 's completely wrong 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 45.02 54.97 <NA> if you think about this question for any length of time it 's blindingly obvious why we have a brain we have a brain for one reason and one reason only <unk> and that 's to produce adaptable
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 55.08 58.9 <NA> <unk> and complex movements there is no other reason to have a brain 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 58.44 59.99 <NA> think about it 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 59.99 69.13 <NA> movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you now that 's not quite true there 's one other way <unk> and that 's through sweating <unk> but apart from that 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 68.73 79.73 <NA> everything else goes through contractions of muscles so think about communication speech <unk> gestures writing sign language they 're all mediated through contractions of your muscles
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 80.05 85.38 <NA> <unk> so it 's really important to remember that sensory memory and cognitive processes are all important 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 85.38 95.55 <NA> but they 're only important to either drive or suppress future movements there can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 95.37 99.96 <NA> if it doesn 't affect the way you 're going to move later in life <unk> now for those who don 't believe
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 100.46 106.29 <NA> <unk> we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain <unk> but the clinching evidence is this animal here the humble sea squirt <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 106.09 114.73 <NA> rudimentary animal has a nervous system swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life <unk> and at some point of its life it implants on a rock <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 114.73 122.88 <NA> and the first thing it does in implanting on that rock <unk> which it never leaves is to digest its own brain and nervous system for food <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 123.29 129.4 <NA> so once you don 't need to move you don 't need the luxury of that brain and this animal is often
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 129.96 135.07 <NA> <unk> often taken as an analogy to what happens at universities when professors get tenure <unk> but that 's a different subject

DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 139.16 153.68 <NA> i am a movement chauvinist <unk> i believe movement is the most important function of the brain don 't let anyone tell you that it 's not true <unk> now if movement is so important how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement and the answer is we 're doing extremely poorly it 's a very hard problem <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 153.68 154.91 <NA> but we can look at how well

DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 168.99 177.5 <NA> well the answer is ibm 's deep blue will occasionally win and i think if ibm 's deep blue played anyone in this room it would win every time that problem is solved 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 180.02 184.12 <NA> <unk> picking up a chess piece dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board if
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 184.12 193.05 <NA> you put a five <unk> year old child 's dexterity against the best robots of today the answer is simple the child wins easily there 's no competition at all 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 192.62 200.05 <NA> now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard one reason is a very smart five year old could tell you the
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 200.13 208.86 <NA> <unk> algorithm for that top problem look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win so it 's a very simple algorithm <unk> now of course there are other moves <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 208.7 212.89 <NA> but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 212.89 221.99 <NA> when it comes to being dexterous it 's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous and we 'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world which has a lot of problems <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 221.78 225.02 <NA> but let me show you cutting edge robotics now a lot of robotics is very
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 225.61 239.69 <NA> <unk> but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages <unk> so this is the end of a ph d project from one of the best robotics institutes <unk> and the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass it 's a hard problem because the water sloshes about but it can do it <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 239.47 248.96 <NA> but it doesn 't do it with anything like the agility of a human now if you want this robot to do a different task that 's another three year ph d program <unk> there is
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 248.62 254.82 <NA> no generalization at all from one task to another in robotics <unk> now we can compare this to

DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 260.83 269.65 <NA> now the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking it 's a high school sport where you have twelve cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 269.46 272.59 <NA> and this is her getting the world record in real time
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 289.68 295.78 <NA> <unk> and she 's pretty happy <unk> we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that and that 's what we 'd like to know 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 295.29 299.78 <NA> so in my group what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement <unk>
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 300.28 309.78 <NA> <unk> and it sounds like an easy problem you send a command down it causes muscles to contract your arm or body moves and you get sensory feedback from vision from skin from muscles and so on 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 309.78 321.45 <NA> the trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be so one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is for example sensory feedback is extremely noisy <unk> now by noise <unk> i do not mean sound <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 321.22 328.98 <NA> we use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal <unk> so the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 329.84 331.86 <NA> <unk> station you wanted to hear that was the noise 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 331.86 343.29 <NA> but more generally this noise is something that corrupts the signal <unk> so for example if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 342.83 354.55 <NA> similarly when you put motor output on movement output it 's extremely noisy forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in darts just aim for the same spot over and over again you have a huge spread due to movement variability
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 354.96 361.94 <NA> <unk> and more than that the outside world or task is both ambiguous and variable <unk> the teapot could be full it could be empty it changes over time <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 361.76 372.22 <NA> so we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise <unk> now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce <unk>
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 372.12 379.49 <NA> <unk> the consequences of noise <unk> so if you 're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 379.93 383.48 <NA> <unk> society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 383.98 392.84 <NA> <unk> now what i want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 392.35 404.7 <NA> and to do that i 'm going to tell you about a framework which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last fifty years called bayesian decision theory <unk> and it 's more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 405.11 410.7 <NA> <unk> and the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions <unk> so let 's think about the inference 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 410.24 418.5 <NA> you want to generate beliefs about the world so what are beliefs beliefs could be where are my arms in space am i looking at a cat or a fox <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 418.5 424.9 <NA> but we 're going to represent beliefs with probabilities so we 're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 425 431.41 <NA> <unk> zero meaning i don 't believe it at all one means i 'm absolutely certain and numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 431.1 438.37 <NA> and the key idea to bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference you have data 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 438.17 444.13 <NA> and data in neuroscience is sensory input <unk> so i have sensory input which i can take in to make beliefs <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 444.13 449.99 <NA> but there 's another source of information <unk> and that 's effectively prior knowledge you accumulate knowledge throughout your life in
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 451 464.5 <NA> <unk> and the point about bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs <unk> and i 've put the formula up there i 'm not going to explain what that formula is but it 's very beautiful <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 464.51 473.22 <NA> and it has real beauty and real explanatory power <unk> and what it really says and what you want to estimate is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 473.04 474.87 <NA> so let me give you an intuitive example <unk>
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 477.32 478.37 <NA> <unk> play tennis
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 478.09 482.46 <NA> and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 481.97 485.69 <NA> there are two sources of information bayes <unk> ' rule tells you there
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 485.7 492.91 <NA> 's sensory evidence you can use visual information auditory information <unk> and that might tell you it 's going to land in that red spot <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 492.43 495.24 <NA> but you know that your senses are not perfect 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 495.24 502.98 <NA> and therefore there 's some variability of where it 's going to land shown by that cloud of red representing numbers between zero point five and maybe zero point one 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 502.76 504.97 <NA> that information is available in the current
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 505.67 517.01 <NA> but there 's another source of information not available on the current shot <unk> but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis and that 's that the ball doesn 't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 516.77 525.02 <NA> if you 're playing against a very good opponent they may distribute it in that green area which is the prior distribution making it hard for you to return <unk> now both these
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 525.25 536.49 <NA> <unk> of information carry important information <unk> and what bayes ' rule says is that i should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow which have the ellipses <unk> and that 's my belief 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 536.49 546.18 <NA> so it 's the optimal way of combining information now i wouldn 't tell you all this if it wasn 't that a few years ago we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills and
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 545.97 550.17 <NA> what it means is we really are bayesian inference machines as we go around
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 550.46 560.88 <NA> <unk> we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down <unk> but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is and then combine those in a real bayesian way <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 561.02 564.43 <NA> now a key part to the bayesian is this part of the formula <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 564.43 572.29 <NA> and what this part really says is i have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 572.05 575.37 <NA> so that really means i have to make predictions of the future <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 574.88 578.86 <NA> and i want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 580.08 583.6 <NA> <unk> it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 583.38 590 <NA> and to do that i 'll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input <unk> so you send a command out 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 590 597.43 <NA> you get sensory feedback back and that transformation is governed by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 597.09 600.02 <NA> but you can imagine looking inside the brain and here 's inside the
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 600.82 613.03 <NA> <unk> you might have a little predictor a neural simulator of the physics of your body and your senses <unk> so as you send a movement command down you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 612.87 623.39 <NA> the sensory consequences of your actions so as i shake this ketchup bottle <unk> i get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row <unk> and if i 've got a good predictor <unk> it predicts the same thing 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 623.38 625.05 <NA> well why would i bother doing that
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 625 634.2 <NA> i 'm going to get the same feedback anyway <unk> well there 's good reasons <unk> imagine as i shake the ketchup bottle someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 634.42 638.49 <NA> now i get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 638.26 648.43 <NA> so i get two sources i get you tapping on it <unk> and i get me shaking it but from my senses ' point of view that is combined together into one source of information <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 648.43 653.77 <NA> now there 's good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 653.61 654.94 <NA> because external events
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 654.96 659.23 <NA> <unk> actually much more behaviorally relevant than feeling everything that 's going on inside my body <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 658.77 668.83 <NA> so one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction which is only based on your movement commands with the reality any discrepancy <unk>
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 668.78 677.33 <NA> should hopefully be external so as i go around the world <unk> i 'm making predictions of what i should get subtracting them off everything left over is external to me 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 679.87 681.02 <NA> <unk> clear example
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 680.85 689.18 <NA> where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person and so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling it
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 688.87 693.09 <NA> 's been known for a long time you can 't tickle yourself as well as other people can 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 693.09 699.99 <NA> but it hasn 't really been shown it 's because you have a neural simulator <unk> simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 700.19 705.76 <NA> <unk> so we can bring the experiments of the 21st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 705.76 711.24 <NA> and in effect what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot and they 're going to move that back and forward 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 710.84 717.3 <NA> and then we 're going to track that with a computer and use it to control another robot which is going to tickle their palm with another stick <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 716.87 722.82 <NA> and then we 're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things including ticklishness i 'll show you just one part of our study 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 722.82 729.94 <NA> and here i 've taken away the robots but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward <unk> and we replay that to the other hand
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 730.01 736.33 <NA> with a time delay <unk> either no time delay in which case light would just tickle your palm or with a time <unk>
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 739.47 749.72 <NA> so the important point here is the right hand always does the same things sinusoidal movement the left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle all we 're playing with is a tempo causality <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 749.67 754.88 <NA> <unk> and as we go from naught to zero point one second it becomes more ticklish as you go from zero point
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 754.84 763.58 <NA> <unk> one to zero point two it becomes more ticklish at the end and by zero point two of a second <unk> it 's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 763.09 776.51 <NA> so whatever is responsible for this cancellation is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality <unk> and based on this illustration we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain 's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 776.11 779.52 <NA> now i have to admit these are the worst studies my lab has ever run
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 779.81 791.43 <NA> <unk> because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant <unk> so we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena <unk> and in the intervening years i had two daughters 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 791.43 800.05 <NA> and one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys they get into fights which started with one of them doing something to the other the other retaliating it quickly
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 800.94 808.59 <NA> <unk> and children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force now when i screamed at my children to stop <unk> sometimes they would both say to me
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 808.43 810.88 <NA> the other person hit them harder <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 810.72 819.46 <NA> now i happen to know my children don 't lie <unk> so i thought as a neuroscientist it was important how i could explain how they were telling inconsistent truths <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 819.15 822.02 <NA> and we hypothesize based on the tickling study
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 821.86 824.93 <NA> that when one child hits another they generate the movement
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 825.31 832.1 <NA> <unk> they predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off so they actually think they 've hit the person less hard than they have rather like the tickling 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 831.64 840.71 <NA> whereas the passive recipient doesn 't make the prediction feels the full blow <unk> so if they retaliate with the same force the first person will think it 's been escalated <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 840.43 843.74 <NA> so we decided to test this in the lab now
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 844.81 852.12 <NA> we don 't work with children we don 't work with hitting but the concept is identical <unk> we bring in two adults we tell them they 're going to play a game 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 852.12 854.31 <NA> and so here 's player one and player two sitting opposite
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 854.9 856.19 <NA> <unk> and the game is very simple 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 855.97 865.33 <NA> we started with a motor with a little lever a little force transfuser and we use this motor to apply force down to player one 's fingers for three seconds and then it stops <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 865.33 868.87 <NA> and that player 's been told remember the experience of that force
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 868.7 875.08 <NA> and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject 's finger through a force transfuser and they do
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 875.7 881.21 <NA> <unk> player two 's been told remember the experience of that force use your other hand to apply the force back down <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 881 885.74 <NA> and so they take it in turns to apply the force they 've just experienced back and forward <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 885.53 892.75 <NA> but critically they 're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms <unk> so they don 't know the rules the other person 's playing by <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 892.75 904.79 <NA> and what we 've measured is the force as a function of terms and if we look at what we start with a quarter of a newton there a number of turns perfect would be that red line <unk> and what we see in all pairs of subjects is this
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 904.96 909.08 <NA> a seventy percent escalation in force on each go <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 908.71 917.9 <NA> so it really suggests when you 're doing this based on this study and others we 've done that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it 's producing <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 917.9 922.46 <NA> so it re shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 922.27 924.87 <NA> so we 've made inferences we 've done
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 925.49 927.46 <NA> <unk> now we have to generate actions <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 927.22 933.28 <NA> and what bayes ' rule says is given my beliefs <unk> the action should in some sense be optimal but we 've got a problem <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 933.07 943.77 <NA> tasks are symbolic i want to drink i want to dance but the movement system has to contract six hundred muscles in a particular sequence and there 's a big gap between the task and the movement <unk>
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 943.67 949.99 <NA> <unk> system <unk> so it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways so think about just a point to point movement i could choose these two
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 951.09 957.92 <NA> <unk> infinite number of paths having chosen a particular path <unk> i can hold my hand on that path as infinitely many different joint configurations <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 957.92 962.51 <NA> and i can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 962.32 971.29 <NA> so i have a huge amount of choice to make now it turns out we are extremely stereotypical <unk> we all move the same way pretty much <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 970.8 979.97 <NA> and so it turns out we 're so stereotypical our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping <unk> so if i take some dots and
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 979.96 985.86 <NA> <unk> set them in motion with biological motion your brain 's circuitry would understand instantly what 's going on 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 985.86 998.16 <NA> now this is a bunch of dots moving you will know what this person is doing whether happy sad old young a huge amount of information if these dots were cars going on a racing circuit you would have absolutely no idea what 's going on 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 997.94 1001.64 <NA> so why is it that we move the particular ways we do
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1004.84 1019.04 <NA> <unk> maybe we don 't all quite move the same way maybe there 's variation in the population and maybe those who move better than others have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation <unk> so in evolutionary scales movements get better and perhaps in life movements get better through learning <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1018.82 1024.78 <NA> so what is it about a movement which is good or bad imagine i want to intercept this ball here are two possible
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1026.87 1032.2 <NA> <unk> if i choose the left hand path <unk> i can work out the forces required in one of my muscles as a function of time <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1032.2 1045.94 <NA> but there 's noise added to this so what i actually get based on this lovely smooth desired force is a very noisy version <unk> so if i pick the same command through many times i will get a different noisy version each time because noise changes each time <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1045.75 1049.99 <NA> so what i can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if i choose that
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1050.97 1064.36 <NA> <unk> if i choose a different way of moving on the right for example then i 'll have a different command different noise playing through a noisy system very complicated all we can be sure of is the variability will be different if i move in this particular way <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1064.47 1074.92 <NA> i end up with a smaller variability across many movements so if i have to choose between those two i would choose the right one because it 's less variable <unk> and the fundamental idea is you want to plan <unk>
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1074.82 1079.91 <NA> <unk> your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise and one intuition to get is
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1079.87 1087.59 <NA> <unk> actually the amount of noise or variability i show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger so you want to avoid big forces as one principle <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1087.19 1097.58 <NA> so we 've shown that using this we can explain a huge amount of data that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1097.24 1104.94 <NA> so i hope i 've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement and it 's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1104.92 1111 <NA> it 's also relevant for disease and rehabilitation there are many diseases which effect movement <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1111 1115.41 <NA> and hopefully if we understand how we control movement we can apply that to robotic technology 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1114.98 1125.14 <NA> and finally i want to remind you when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks <unk> the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic <unk> thank you very much
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1139.62 1148.76 <NA> <unk> that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about the the dreaming the yearning the falling in love and all these things are a kind of side show an accident
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1154.6 1163.89 <NA> <unk> sensation or memory without realizing why you 're laying down memories of childhood <unk> the fact that we forget most of our childhood for example is probably fine because it doesn 't effect our movements later in life <unk> 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1163.89 1167.66 <NA> you only need to store things which are really going to effect movement ca 
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1167.17 1175.02 <NA> so you think that people thinking about the brain and consciousness generally could get real insight by saying <unk> where does movement play in this game dw so people have
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1175 1179.37 <NA> found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision
DanielWolpert_2011G 1 DanielWolpert_2011G 1178.97 1186.04 <NA> is a mistake you have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision <unk> and it uses it very differently once you think about
