HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 365.67 370.55 <NA> so you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano

HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 386.05 391.72 <NA> now of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys

HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 460.42 469.05 <NA> so what we did was for the past fifteen years was to dissect out the neocortex systematically <unk> it 's a bit
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 468.57 472.79 <NA> like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest

HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 479.93 490.29 <NA> <unk> than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication the rules of connectivity because the neurons don 't just like to connect with any neuron <unk>
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 490.24 499.92 <NA> they choose very carefully who they connect with it 's also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three dimensional digital models of them <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 504.99 512.17 <NA> <unk> neurons we came across and once you have that you can actually begin to build the neocortical column

HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 526.53 529.91 <NA> they can form a synapse and a synapse is

HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 547.21 553.17 <NA> and when you think of the fabric of the brain the structure how is it built what is the pattern of the carpet
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 554.66 560.13 <NA> <unk> realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 559.7 568.98 <NA> and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 568.76 573.54 <NA> the reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 573.71 574.93 <NA> every neuron is
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 575.76 583.22 <NA> <unk> it 's the same in the forest every pine tree is different you may have many different types of trees but every pine tree is different and in the brain it 's the same 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 583.22 588.73 <NA> so there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 588.78 596.53 <NA> and your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way <unk> and you may have more or less neurons <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 596.04 604.88 <NA> so it 's very unlikely that you got the same fabric the same circuitry so how could we possibly create a reality that we can

HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 606.88 613.35 <NA> well we don 't have to speculate we can look at all ten million synapses now we can look at the fabric <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 613.35 622.91 <NA> and we can change neurons we can use different neurons with different variations we can position them in different places <unk> orient them in different places we can use less or more of them <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 622.69 624.92 <NA> and when we do that
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 624.49 627.87 <NA> what we discovered is that the circuitry does change
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 629.98 633.66 <NA> of how the circuitry is designed does not 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 634.25 643.39 <NA> so the fabric of the brain <unk> even though your brain may be smaller bigger <unk> it may have different types of neurons different
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 643.16 646.92 <NA> morphologies of neurons we actually do share
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 646.64 650.11 <NA> the same fabric <unk> and we think this is
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 651.3 660.16 <NA> <unk> which means that that could explain why we can 't communicate across species <unk> so let 's switch it on but to do it what you have to do is you have to make this come alive <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 659.91 664.33 <NA> we make it come alive with equations a lot of mathematics 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 664.33 671.2 <NA> and in fact the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two cambridge nobel laureates <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 670.71 679.03 <NA> so we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive <unk> we also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 679.93 689.87 <NA> <unk> how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other <unk> and when they get to the synapse what they do is they effectively literally shock
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 689.67 696.35 <NA> the synapse it 's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 696.35 702.65 <NA> and we 've got the mathematics to describe this process so we can describe the communication between the neurons <unk>
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 702.37 704.67 <NA> there literally are only a
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 704.63 705.87 <NA> <unk> handful
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 705.67 710.4 <NA> of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 709.97 717.58 <NA> but what you do need is a very big computer <unk> and in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 717.58 725.14 <NA> so you need ten thousand laptops so where do you go you go to ibm and you get a supercomputer because they know how to take ten thousand
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 725.04 728.17 <NA> <unk> laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator <unk> 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 727.86 736.9 <NA> so now we have this blue gene supercomputer <unk> we can load up all the neurons each one on to its processor <unk> and fire it up 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 736.9 741.22 <NA> and see what happens take the magic carpet for a ride 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 741.18 749.87 <NA> here we activate it <unk> and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation it 's the first
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 751.42 756.2 <NA> <unk> when you look at that the first time you think my god how is reality coming out of that 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 757.78 759.74 <NA> but in fact 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 759.73 769.71 <NA> you can start even though we haven 't trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality <unk> but we can ask where
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 769.47 774.75 <NA> is the rose we can ask where is it inside if we stimulate it with a
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 775.88 781.62 <NA> <unk> where is it inside the neocortex ultimately it 's got to be there if we stimulated it with it 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 781.88 792.99 <NA> so the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons ignore the synapses and look just at the raw electrical activity because that is what it 's creating it 's creating electrical patterns 
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 792.86 797.77 <NA> so when we did this we indeed for the first time <unk> saw these
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 804.81 812.09 <NA> <unk> neocortical column and it 's these electrical objects that are holding all the information about
HenryMarkram_2009G 1 HenryMarkram_2009G 812.09 819.53 <NA> whatever stimulated it and then when we zoomed into this <unk> it 's like a veritable universe
