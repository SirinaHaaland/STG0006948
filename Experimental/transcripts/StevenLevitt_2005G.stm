StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 34.54 41.94 <NA> it was certainly better than what they had before <unk> and one of the good things about this this cure was that
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 41.57 49.96 <NA> it was free <unk> virtually free <unk> and was very easy to use but the worst thing about it was that you couldn 't use it on the youngest children on

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 61.68 71.53 <NA> came up with a second a second cure <unk> and the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 73.24 75.11 <NA> the problem with this cure was
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 75.16 81.41 <NA> <unk> it was very expensive and it was very complicated to use and although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 85.63 91.93 <NA> <unk> but what they did of course since it was so complicated and expensive they only used it on the <unk> zero year olds and the one year olds 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 91.93 96.14 <NA> and they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two year olds and up and
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 95.98 104.79 <NA> this went on for quite some time people were happy they had their two cures until a particular mother whose child had just turned two died of this disease
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 105.92 113.67 <NA> and she thought to herself my child just turned two and until the child turned two i had always used
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 113.75 118.74 <NA> this complicated expensive cure you know this treatment 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 118.74 124.84 <NA> and then the child turned two and i started using the cheap and easy treatment and i wonder and she wondered like all parents who lose children

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 132.92 141.1 <NA> and she said how could it possibly be that something that 's cheap and simple works as well as something that 's complicated and expensive

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 144.93 150.14 <NA> to switch and use the cheap and simple solution and the government they heard her story
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 150.04 152.93 <NA> <unk> and the other people and they said yeah <unk> you 're right 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 152.47 159.02 <NA> we should make a law we should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 164.56 173.72 <NA> then along came a lowly economist who had children himself <unk> and he used the expensive and complicated
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 173.26 179.34 <NA> treatment but he knew about the cheap and simple one and he thought about it
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 179.87 186.42 <NA> <unk> expensive one didn 't seem that great to him so he thought i don 't know anything about science but i do know something about data <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 186.11 190.78 <NA> so maybe i should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 194.54 202.57 <NA> and lo and behold when he went through the data <unk> he found that it didn 't look like the expensive complicated solution was any better than the cheap one 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 202.57 204.79 <NA> at least for the children who were two and older the
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 205.07 209.76 <NA> the cheap one still didn 't work on the on the kids who were younger <unk> and so he went forth to the people
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 209.54 211.15 <NA> and he said 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 211.29 216.54 <NA> i 've made this wonderful finding it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 226.27 230.36 <NA> <unk> this is a terrible thing because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 230.17 241.64 <NA> and the government was very upset <unk> and in particular the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought how can we hope to compete with something that 's essentially free we would lose all of our market 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 241.63 247.61 <NA> and people were very angry and they called him horrible names <unk> and he decided that maybe he should

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 255.01 261.81 <NA> and come and try and tell the story at that place <unk> and so <unk> anyway here i am it 's not a fairy tale
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 261.32 267.78 <NA> it 's a true story about the united states today <unk> and the disease i 'm referring to is actually

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 279.9 289.15 <NA> <unk> and what i 'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why i believe this to be true <unk> that for for children two years old and up there really is no

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 315.1 321.02 <NA> <unk> enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 329.75 336.21 <NA> <unk> case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats so the united states keeps a data set of every fatal accident that 's happened since <unk>
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 337.21 344.17 <NA> so in every car crash in which at least one person dies they have information on all of the people so if you look at that data it 's right up on the
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 344.17 347.62 <NA> the national highway transportation safety administration 's website
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 347.41 354.82 <NA> you can just look at the raw data and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that 's in favor of car seats for
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 355.14 356.41 <NA> <unk> aged two and up <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 356.01 362.96 <NA> so here is the data <unk> here i have among two to <unk> six year olds anyone above six basically no one uses car seats so you can 't compare <unk>
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 362.96 366.1 <NA> twenty nine point three percent of the children
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 365.79 372.04 <NA> who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies <unk> themselves die <unk>

StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 380.02 388.45 <NA> <unk> die and interestingly wearing a lap only seatbelt <unk> sixteen point seven percent die <unk> and actually the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt 's got to be worse
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 388.29 395.1 <NA> than the lap and shoulder belt and that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 395.1 402.26 <NA> so what we do in the study is and this is just presenting the same information but turned into a
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 401.86 405 <NA> figure to make it easier so the yellow bar represents
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 404.99 414.66 <NA> <unk> car seats <unk> the orange bar lap and shoulder and the red bar lap only seatbelts and this is all relative to unrestrained the bigger the bar the better okay so this is the data i just showed 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 414.38 419.56 <NA> ok so the the highest bar is what you 're striving to beat <unk> so you can control for
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 419.32 429.22 <NA> the basic things like how hard the crash was what seat the child was sitting in etc the age of the child and that 's that middle set of bars and so you can see that the
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 430.13 436.43 <NA> seatbelts start to look worse once you do that and then finally the last set of of bars <unk> which are really
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 436.25 440.5 <NA> controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 440.04 443.25 <NA> fifty seventy five one hundred different characteristics of the crash and
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 443.25 453.11 <NA> what you find is that the car seats and the lap and shoulder belts when it comes to saving lives fatalities look exactly identical <unk> and the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 452.95 454.97 <NA> as well <unk> and it 's not
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 455.02 461.93 <NA> <unk> just overall <unk> it 's very robust to anything you want to look at one thing that 's interesting if you look at frontal impact crashes
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 461.73 465.23 <NA> when the car crashes the front hits into something
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 465.23 474.81 <NA> indeed what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better <unk> and i think this isn 't just chance in order to have the car seat approved you need to pass certain federal
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 475.25 482.97 <NA> <unk> all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash <unk> but when you look at other types of crashes <unk> like rear impact crashes <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 482.97 491.56 <NA> indeed the car seats don 't perform as well and i think that 's because they 've been optimized to pass as we always expect people to do to optimize relative to bright line rules
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 491.4 499.96 <NA> about how how affected the the car will be <unk> and the other thing you might argue is well car seats have got a lot better over time <unk> and so if we look at recent crashes
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 503.25 507.4 <NA> <unk> in the recent crashes the new car seats are far far better but indeed in recent crashes
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 507.24 514.91 <NA> the lap and shoulder seatbelts actually are doing even better than the car seats <unk> they say well that 's impossible that can 't be 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 514.91 517.49 <NA> and the line of argument if you ask parents is 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 517.25 528.26 <NA> but car seats are so expensive and complicated and they have this big tangle of of latches <unk> how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 530.02 532.46 <NA> <unk> of an interesting logic i think that people use 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 532.26 542.51 <NA> and the other logic they say well <unk> the government wouldn 't have told us [ to ] use them if they weren 't much better but what 's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very <unk>
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 542.41 548.3 <NA> <unk> much it really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 554.9 556.24 <NA> <unk> in telling your story
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 556.06 561.88 <NA> by using these abstract statistics and so i had some friends over to dinner
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 561.88 567.69 <NA> <unk> and i was asking we had a cookout i was asking them what what advice they might have for me about
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 567.35 575.05 <NA> about proving my point they said why don 't you run some crash tests and i said that 's a great idea so we actually tried to commission some crash tests and it turns
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 576.3 580.09 <NA> <unk> as we called around to the independent crash test
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 579.93 582.22 <NA> companies around the country
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 582.15 596.39 <NA> <unk> none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said <unk> some explicitly some not so explicitly all of our business comes from car seat manufacturers we can 't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats now eventually one did 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 596.39 599.93 <NA> under the conditions of anonymity they said they would be happy to do
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 600 605.69 <NA> <unk> this test for us so anonymity and one thousand five hundred dollars per seat that we crashed
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 605.29 611.03 <NA> and so we went to buffalo new york and here is the the precursor to it these are the
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 610.83 615.56 <NA> crash test dummies <unk> waiting for their chance to take the center stage <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 615.56 624.96 <NA> and then here 's how the crash test works here they don 't actually crash the entire car you know it 's not worth ruining a whole car to do it so they just have these bench seats and they strap
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 625.46 635.7 <NA> <unk> the car seat and the seatbelt onto it so i just wanted you to look at this and i think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great look at the kid in the car seat does he not look content ready to go like he could survive <unk>
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 635.6 641.11 <NA> <unk> anything and then if you look at the kid in back it looks like he 's already choking before the crash even happens <unk> it 's
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 656.76 666.43 <NA> <unk> by the way <unk> so here this is the car seat now watch two things watch how the head goes forward and basically hits the knees and this is in the car seat and watch how the car seat flies around 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 666.75 675.02 <NA> in the rebound up in the air the car seat 's moving all over the place <unk> bear in mind there are two things about this this is a car seat that was
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 675.25 682.08 <NA> <unk> installed by someone who has installed one thousand car seats who knew exactly how to do it and also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 681.87 686.3 <NA> to install car seats having a flat back makes it much easier to install them <unk> and
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 686.3 696.42 <NA> so so this is a test that 's very much rigged in favor of the car seat <unk> ok so that kid in this crash fared very well the federal standards are that you have to score below a one thousand
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 696.24 699.44 <NA> to be an approved car seat on this crash in some
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 698.95 700.05 <NA> some metric
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 700.22 709.41 <NA> <unk> of units which are not important <unk> and this this crash would have been about a four hundred and fifty so this car seat was actually an above average car seat from consumer reports and did quite well <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 709.04 714.45 <NA> so the next one now this is the kid same crash who is in the seatbelt 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 715.28 719.79 <NA> he hardly moves at all actually relative to the other child 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 719.3 727.62 <NA> the funny thing is the cam work is terrible because they 've only set it up to do the car seats and so they actually don 't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that 's on the rebound 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 727.62 729.7 <NA> anyway <unk> it turns out that those two
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 729.66 734.95 <NA> <unk> crashes <unk> that actually the three year old did slightly worse so he gets about a five hundred
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 734.55 736.09 <NA> out of you know 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 736.11 747.88 <NA> on this range relative to a four hundred and something but still if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government and said i have invented a new car seat <unk> i would like you to approve it for selling 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 747.39 749.93 <NA> then they would say this is a fantastic new car
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 750.82 756.26 <NA> <unk> only got a five hundred it could have gotten as high up as a one thousand and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 756.06 766.31 <NA> into being approved as a car seat so in some sense what this is suggesting is that it 's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong which is putting children at risk it 's just that fundamentally the car seats aren 't doing much <unk>
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 766.26 775.02 <NA> so here 's the crash <unk> so these are timed at the same time so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat at rebound it takes a lot longer but there 's just a lot less movement for
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 779.87 781.95 <NA> <unk> in a car seat and it
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 783.26 787.47 <NA> turns out that that looks terrible but that 's great that 's like a
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 787.22 795.82 <NA> four hundred ok so that kid would do fine in the crash nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all and then here 's the the six year old
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 795.82 799.84 <NA> in the seatbelt and in fact they get exactly within you know within one or two
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 802.89 806.32 <NA> <unk> the car seat did absolutely nothing
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 805.83 811.33 <NA> whatsoever that 's some more evidence <unk> so in some sense i was criticized by
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 811.1 816.41 <NA> a scientist who said you could never publish a study with an n of four meaning those four crashes <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 816.41 824.83 <NA> so i wrote him back and i said what about an n of forty five thousand and four because i had the other forty five thousand other real world crashes <unk> and i just think that it 's interesting that
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 824.46 829.94 <NA> that the idea of using real world crashes which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 829.98 838.58 <NA> something that scientists don 't actually usually think they would rather use a laboratory a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies than actually
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 838.58 841.79 <NA> thirty years of data of what we 've seen with
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 841.36 847.64 <NA> children and with car seats and so i think the answer to this puzzle
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 847.39 848.81 <NA> is
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 848.83 854.76 <NA> that there 's a much better solution out there that 's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 854.87 858.33 <NA> <unk> so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 857.84 865.18 <NA> and if you <unk> if you think from a design perspective about going back to square one and say i just want to protect kids in the back seat i
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 865.18 870.69 <NA> don 't there 's anyone in this room who 'd say well the right way to start would be let 's make a great seat belt for adults <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 870.32 874.62 <NA> and then let 's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 874.25 879.79 <NA> in this daisy chain i mean why not start who 's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids but
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 880.1 889.81 <NA> essentially do something like this which i don 't know exactly how much it would cost to do but there 's no reason i could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat it 's just actually you see this is folding up
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 889.44 897.31 <NA> it 's behind the seat you 've got a regular seat for adults <unk> and then you fold it down and the kid sits on top and it 's integrated it seems to me that this can 't be
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 896.91 904.97 <NA> a very expensive solution <unk> and it 's got to work better than what we already have <unk> so the question is is there any hope for
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 905.22 908.97 <NA> adoption of something like this which would presumably save a lot of lives <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 908.97 916.61 <NA> and i think the answer perhaps <unk> lies in a story the answer both to why has a car seat been so successful 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 916.39 917.81 <NA> and
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 917.35 922.41 <NA> why this may someday be adopted or not lies in a story that my dad told me 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 922.41 928.86 <NA> relating to when he was a doctor in the u s air force in england and this is a long time ago you were allowed to do things then you can 't do today
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 930.17 931.22 <NA> <unk> would
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 931.25 933.82 <NA> have patients come in who he thought
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 933.64 935.52 <NA> were not really sick <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 935.42 943.05 <NA> and he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them and he 'd say come back in a week if you still feel lousy ok
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 942.83 948 <NA> and most of them would not come back but some of them would come back and when they came back 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 947.75 954.76 <NA> he still convinced they were not sick had another jar of pills in this jar were huge horse pills
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 954.98 960.37 <NA> they were almost impossible to swallow and these to me are the analogy for the
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 959.91 969.73 <NA> car seats <unk> people would look at these and say man this thing is so big and so hard to swallow if this doesn 't make me feel better you know what possibly could 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 969.33 973.42 <NA> and it turned out that most people wouldn 't come back because it worked
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 973.2 976.4 <NA> <unk> but every once in a while there was still a patient
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 976.22 978.46 <NA> convinced that he
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 978.45 979.76 <NA> was sick
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 980.7 983.25 <NA> and my dad had a third jar of pills <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 983.01 989.97 <NA> and the jar of pills he had he said <unk> were the tiniest little pills he could find so small you could barely see them <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 989.76 995.85 <NA> and he would say listen i know i gave you that huge pill that complicated hard to swallow pill before <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 995.85 1000.08 <NA> but now i 've got one that 's so potent that is really tiny and small and almost
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1000.55 1002.96 <NA> <unk> almost like this thing here which you can 't even see 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1002.62 1007.28 <NA> and it turned out that never in all the times my dad gave out this pill
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1007.28 1015.44 <NA> the really tiny pill did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness <unk> so my dad always took that as evidence that
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1015.37 1021.53 <NA> this little teeny powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect <unk> and in some sense if that 's the right story 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1021.53 1026.45 <NA> i think integrated car seats you will see very quickly becoming something that everyone has 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1026.14 1029.97 <NA> the other possible conclusion is well maybe after coming to my
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1029.87 1034.87 <NA> <unk> father three times getting sent home with placebos he still felt sick he went and found another doctor
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1034.87 1041.7 <NA> and that 's completely possible and if that 's the case then i think we 're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come thank you very much audience i
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1044.24 1050.14 <NA> just wanted to ask you when we wear seatbelts we don 't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1050.1 1052.42 <NA> <unk> it 's also to prevent lots of serious injury 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1051.96 1056.41 <NA> your data looks at fatalities it doesn 't look at serious injury 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1056.41 1063.56 <NA> is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury because that would prove your case steven levitt 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1063.35 1068.74 <NA> yeah that 's a great question <unk> in my data <unk> and in another data set i 've looked at for new jersey crashes <unk> 
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1068.25 1071.66 <NA> i find very small differences
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1071.48 1079.97 <NA> in injury <unk> so in this data it 's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belts in the new jersey data which
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1079.93 1081.98 <NA> <unk> is different because it 's not just
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1082 1088.67 <NA> fatal crashes but all crashes in new jersey that are reported it turns out that there is a ten percent difference in injuries but
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1088.24 1094.07 <NA> generally they 're the minor injuries now what 's interesting i should say <unk> this as a disclaimer there is medical literature
StevenLevitt_2005G 1 StevenLevitt_2005G 1094.09 1100.05 <NA> that is very difficult to resolve with this other data <unk> which suggests that car seats are dramatically
