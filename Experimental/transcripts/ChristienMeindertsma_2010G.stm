ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 51.3 59.15 <NA> <unk> and what i was curious about because historically the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted and i was curious
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 58.97 62.08 <NA> to find out if this was actually still the case

ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 241.99 249.68 <NA> and then in paintbrushes hairs are used because apparently they 're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 250.46 258.7 <NA> <unk> i was not planning on showing you any meat because of course half the book 's meat and you probably all know what meats they are but i didn 't want you to miss out on this one because this

ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 265.27 272.86 <NA> and what it is it 's actually steak so this is sold as cow but what happens when you slaughter a cow at least in industrial
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 272.63 275.08 <NA> factory farming
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 275.04 284.48 <NA> <unk> they have all these little bits of steak left that they can 't actually sell as steak so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 284.48 289.78 <NA> then freeze the sausage <unk> cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 289.44 290.77 <NA> and

ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 296.67 299.96 <NA> so with the steak you might drink a beer in the
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 300 309.98 <NA> brewing process there 's lots of cloudy elements in the beer so to get rid of these cloudy elements what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 310.24 314.96 <NA> cloudiness this actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 316.06 327.15 <NA> there 's actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter and according to them this creates an artificial lung in the filter
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 330.07 332.43 <NA> this is actually a healthier cigarette 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 333.98 344.82 <NA> injectable collagen or since the ' 70s collagen from pigs has been used for injecting into wrinkles and the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings so the collagen is as well 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 345.74 349.75 <NA> well this must be the strangest thing i found this is
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 349.59 353.83 <NA> a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 354.99 362.74 <NA> <unk> while i was making the book i contacted all the producers of products because i wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens so
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 363.3 367.96 <NA> i sent this company an email saying hello i 'm christien i 'm doing this research and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 367.47 375.02 <NA> can you send me a bullet and well <unk> i didn 't expect them to even answer my email but they answered and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 375.73 381.11 <NA> <unk> you for your email what an interesting story are you in anyway related to the dutch government i
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 381.04 386.15 <NA> thought that was really weird as if the dutch government sends emails to anyone 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 390.16 395.19 <NA> so the most beautiful thing i found at least what i think is the most beautiful in the book is
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 395.19 400.43 <NA> this heart valve it 's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 400 404.19 <NA> the low tech bit is that it 's literally a pig 's heart valve mounted in the
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 404.99 407.43 <NA> <unk> is a memory metal casing and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 407.23 412.09 <NA> what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 411.91 416.53 <NA> and once it 's in the right spot they remove the outer shell and the heart valve <unk> 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 416.53 422.97 <NA> well it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating instantly it 's really a sort of magical moment
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 423.05 426.04 <NA> <unk> so this is actually a dutch company so
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 425.83 429.1 <NA> i called them up and i asked can i borrow a heart valve from you
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 430.02 438.88 <NA> and the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic so they were like okay we 'll put it in a jar for you with formalin and you can borrow it great
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 438.45 442.69 <NA> and then i didn 't hear from from them for weeks <unk> so
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 442.23 450.05 <NA> i called and i asked what 's going on with the heart valve and they said well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 458.2 469.7 <NA> <unk> the last product from the book that i 'm showing you is renewable energy actually to show that my first question if pigs are still used up until the last bit was still true well it is because everything that can 't be used for anything else
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 469.7 474.98 <NA> is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source <unk> 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 479.27 488.76 <NA> <unk> what they showed me is that well <unk> firstly it 's at least to say odd that we don 't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens <unk> and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 488.39 495.54 <NA> the second is that we actually don 't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of <unk> and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 495.77 504.88 <NA> you might think i 'm very fond of pigs but actually well i am a little bit but i 'm more fond of of raw materials in general and i think that
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 504.93 512.35 <NA> in order to take better care of what 's behind our products so the livestock the crops the plants 
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 512.22 516.73 <NA> the non renewable materials but also the people that produce these products
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 1 ChristienMeindertsma_2010G 516.24 520.94 <NA> the first step would actually be to know that they are there <unk> thank you
