TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 12.79 16.73 <NA> <unk> you may not realize this but there are more bacteria in your body
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 16.53 19.64 <NA> than stars in our entire galaxy 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 19.72 25.43 <NA> this fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 25.18 29.97 <NA> and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 30.07 32.28 <NA> like we program computers
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 32.45 41.76 <NA> <unk> now the diagram that you see here i know it looks like some kind of sports play <unk> but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program i developed <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 41.27 48.39 <NA> and like writing software we can print and write dna into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 48.29 49.87 <NA> what this program does is
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 50 52.7 <NA> produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 52.46 58.93 <NA> and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize as you 're seeing in this movie 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 58.98 64.15 <NA> the growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 63.87 69.65 <NA> now what you can 't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 69.65 75.14 <NA> and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 76.45 83.1 <NA> <unk> and the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale <unk> but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 83.1 89.51 <NA> in larger colonies of bacteria this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 89.2 92.9 <NA> and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 93.34 97.52 <NA> now our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 97.51 102.83 <NA> in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 103.36 104.97 <NA> you can observe quorum sensing
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 104.96 111.87 <NA> <unk> action in this movie <unk> where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density <unk>
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 111.83 117.22 <NA> our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 117.06 124.96 <NA> as the colony grows outwards this particular movie and experiment we call the supernova because it looks like an exploding star
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 126.39 130.9 <NA> <unk> besides programming these beautiful patterns i wondered <unk> what else can we get these bacteria to do <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 130.59 136.69 <NA> and i decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 137.67 143.68 <NA> one of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 143.22 149.96 <NA> this happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access <unk> and so bacteria find these tumors
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 150 153.17 <NA> <unk> and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 153.31 158.57 <NA> we started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 158.08 164.54 <NA> and found that when orally delivered to mice these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 164.47 168.72 <NA> we realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 168.72 174.72 <NA> and hence the presence of the tumors <unk> was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine <unk>
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 175.28 182.64 <NA> <unk> and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 182.69 190.77 <NA> we went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer <unk> one that is challenging to detect otherwise <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 191.51 200.11 <NA> now since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors <unk> we 've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 200 209.2 <NA> <unk> molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors and we 've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies <unk> 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 208.83 218.11 <NA> altogether <unk> imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer or even other diseases 
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 218.37 229.76 <NA> our ability to program bacteria and program life opens up new horizons in cancer research <unk> and to share this vision i worked with artist vik muniz to create the symbol of the universe
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 230.02 238.77 <NA> <unk> entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells <unk> ultimately <unk> my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe
TalDanino_2015U 1 TalDanino_2015U 238.77 243.99 <NA> can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research <unk> thank you
