TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 41.71 47.1 <NA> but eighteen months later this is this is how innovation happens eighteen months later my boss
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 46.85 49.78 <NA> said i could do it on the side as a sort of a play
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 51.3 55.21 <NA> <unk> kick the tires of a new computer we 'd got and so he gave me the time

TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 56.09 61.67 <NA> so i basically roughed out what html should look like 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 61.67 71.92 <NA> hypertext protocol http <unk> the idea of urls these names for things which started with http <unk> i wrote the code and put it out there <unk> 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 71.58 74.81 <NA> why did i do it <unk> well it was basically frustration
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 77.38 84.41 <NA> <unk> i was working as a software engineer in this huge very exciting lab lots of people coming from all over the world they
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 83.95 88.13 <NA> brought all sorts of different computers with them they had all sorts of different
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 87.96 97.97 <NA> data formats all sorts all kinds of documentation systems so that in all that diversity if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 97.97 104.82 <NA> everything i looked into i had to connect to some new machine i had to learn to run some new program
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 105.01 111.5 <NA> i would find the information i wanted in some new data format and these were all incompatible 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 111.51 116.05 <NA> it was just very frustrating the frustration was all this unlocked potential <unk> 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 115.87 119.04 <NA> in fact on all these discs there were documents
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 118.79 125.26 <NA> <unk> so if you just imagined them all being part of some big <unk> virtual documentation
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 125.22 131.11 <NA> <unk> system in the sky say on the internet then life would be so much easier 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 130.62 143.14 <NA> well once you 've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don 't read your memo actually he did <unk> it was found after he died his copy <unk> he had written vague but exciting in pencil in the corner 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 143.97 154.43 <NA> but in general it was difficult it was really difficult to explain what the web was like it 's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then but then ok <unk> when ted started
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 154.99 156.42 <NA> <unk> web so
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 156.42 166.49 <NA> things like click didn 't have the same meaning i can show somebody a piece of hypertext a page which has got links and we click on the link and bing there 'll be another hypertext page 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 166.3 174.99 <NA> not impressive you know we 've seen that we 've got things on hypertext on cd roms what was difficult was to get them to imagine 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 176.18 180.75 <NA> <unk> imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 181.43 183.97 <NA> alright that is the leap
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 183.97 190.77 <NA> that was very difficult for people to make well <unk> some people did <unk> so yeah it was difficult to explain but there was a grassroots movement
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 191 203.95 <NA> and that is what has made it most fun that has been the most exciting thing not the technology not the things people have done with it but actually the community the spirit of all these people getting together <unk> sending the emails that 's what it was like then
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 204.96 214.09 <NA> <unk> funny but right now it 's kind of like that again i asked everybody more or less to put their documents i said could you put your documents on this web thing

TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 215.13 224.96 <NA> you did <unk> thanks <unk> it 's been a blast hasn 't it i mean it has been quite interesting because we 've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away they 're much
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 225 227.24 <NA> <unk> more than we 'd originally imagined when we
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 226.87 234.29 <NA> put together the little <unk> initial website that we started off with now <unk> i want you to put your data on the web <unk> 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 233.92 244.07 <NA> turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential there is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven 't got data on the web <unk>
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 243.97 249.71 <NA> <unk> as data what do you mean data what 's the difference documents data well documents you read ok <unk>

TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 281.21 287.86 <NA> this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 287.66 294.75 <NA> the economics in the developing world he put up a slide a little bit like this it had underground all the data
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 294.75 299.93 <NA> ok data is brown and boxy and boring and that 's how we think of it isn 't it because
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 300 309.95 <NA> data you can 't naturally use by itself but in fact data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it in this case 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 309.52 314.06 <NA> hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of united nations

TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 330.5 344.53 <NA> <unk> this wonderful presentation and hans made a point of saying look it 's really important to have a lot of data and i was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying very forcibly it 's really important to have a lot of data 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 344.53 350.02 <NA> so i want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected or six like
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 350.67 361.93 <NA> <unk> i want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data <unk> the technology is linked data and it 's extremely simple if
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 361.47 365.78 <NA> you want to put something on the web there are three rules first thing is

TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 387.4 401.37 <NA> if i take one of these http names and i look it up and i do the web thing with it and i fetch the data using the http protocol from the web <unk> i will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 404.9 413.13 <NA> <unk> who 's at the event whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that so the second rule is i get important information back <unk> third rule is

TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 429.96 435.31 <NA> <unk> expresses a relationship then the other thing that it 's related to is given
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 435.12 448.09 <NA> one of those names that starts http <unk> so i can go ahead and look that thing up so i look up a person i can look up then the city where they were born then i can look up the region it 's in and the town it 's in and the population of it 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 448.09 452.27 <NA> and so on so i can browse this stuff so that 's it really

TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 481.48 490.77 <NA> they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together the more powerful it is 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 490.43 492.6 <NA> so linked data <unk> 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 492.11 494.97 <NA> the meme went out there and 
TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 494.97 504.97 <NA> pretty soon chris bizer at the freie universitat in berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up he noticed that wikipedia you know wikipedia the online encyclopedia with

TimBernersLee_2009 1 TimBernersLee_2009 579.87 586.84 <NA> <unk> unlocked potential let 's start with government data <unk> barack obama said in a speech that he
