AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 13.78 18.68 <NA> <unk> at the stars at night it 's amazing what you can see it 's beautiful <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 18.22 27.72 <NA> but what 's more amazing is what you can 't see because what we know now is that around every star or almost every star there 's a planet <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 27.72 29.16 <NA> or probably a few
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 30.11 36.18 <NA> <unk> so what this picture isn 't showing you are all the planets that we know about out there in space <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 35.78 43.65 <NA> but when we think about planets we tend to think of faraway things that are very different from our own <unk> but here we are on a planet
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 43.4 51.27 <NA> and there are so many things that are amazing about earth that we 're searching far and wide to find things that are like that 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 50.87 54.4 <NA> and when we 're searching we 're finding amazing things
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 55.07 59.11 <NA> i want to tell you about an amazing thing here on earth 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 58.62 66.88 <NA> and that is that every minute four hundred pounds of hydrogen and almost seven pounds of helium
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 66.51 72.07 <NA> escape from earth into space and this is gas
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 72.07 79.97 <NA> that is going off and never coming back <unk> so hydrogen helium and many other things make up what 's known as the earth
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 79.99 81.23 <NA> <unk> 's atmosphere 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 81.23 90.92 <NA> the atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line that 's seen here from the international space station a photograph that some astronauts took <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 90.7 101.67 <NA> and this tenuous veneer around our planet is what allows life to flourish <unk> it protects our planet from too many impacts from meteorites and the like 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 101.67 104.4 <NA> and it 's such an amazing
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 105.31 108.48 <NA> that the fact that it 's disappearing
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 108.02 115.29 <NA> should frighten you at least a little bit so this process is something that i study
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 115.06 118.05 <NA> and it 's called atmospheric escape <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 118.19 123.09 <NA> so atmospheric escape is not specific to planet earth it
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 123.09 129.91 <NA> 's part of what it means to be a planet if you ask me because planets not just here on earth but
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 129.9 137.5 <NA> <unk> throughout the universe can undergo atmospheric escape <unk> and the way it happens actually tells us
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 137.28 145.21 <NA> about planets themselves because when you think about the solar system <unk> you might think about this picture here <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 145.32 153.17 <NA> and you would say well there are eight planets maybe nine <unk> so for those of you who are stressed by this picture i will add somebody for you
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 154.99 157.64 <NA> <unk> new horizons we 're including pluto <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 157.66 168.18 <NA> and the thing here is for the purposes of this talk and atmospheric escape <unk> pluto is a planet in my mind in the same way that planets around other stars that we can 't see
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 167.7 169.74 <NA> are also planets 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 169.74 179.91 <NA> so fundamental characteristics of planets include the fact that they are bodies that are bound together by gravity so it 's a lot of material just stuck together
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 180.02 182.01 <NA> <unk> with this attractive force <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 182.01 190.5 <NA> and these bodies are so big and have so much gravity that 's why they 're round <unk> so when you look at all of these including pluto they 're round <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 190.52 200.08 <NA> so you can see that gravity is really at play here <unk> but another fundamental characteristic about planets is what you don 't see here <unk> and that 's the star
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 201.57 209.41 <NA> <unk> all of the planets in the solar system are orbiting around and that 's fundamentally driving atmospheric escape <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 209.28 216.74 <NA> the reason that fundamentally stars drive atmospheric escape from planets is because stars
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 216.58 220.55 <NA> offer planets particles and light and heat
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 220.37 229.34 <NA> that can cause the atmospheres to go away <unk> so if you think of a hot air balloon <unk> or you look at this picture of lanterns in thailand at a festival
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 229.84 242.84 <NA> <unk> see that hot air can propel gasses upward and if you have enough energy and heating which our sun does that gas which is so light and only bound by gravity <unk> it can escape into space 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 243.13 254.94 <NA> and so this is what 's actually causing atmospheric escape here on earth and also on other planets that interplay between heating from the star and overcoming the force of gravity
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 255.23 264.72 <NA> on the planet <unk> so i 've told you that it happens at the rate of four hundred pounds a minute for hydrogen and almost seven pounds for helium <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 264.53 266.5 <NA> but what does that look like 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 266.29 268.36 <NA> well even in the ' 80s 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 268.36 279.82 <NA> we took pictures of the earth in the ultraviolet using nasa 's dynamic explorer spacecraft <unk> so these two images of the earth show you what that glow of escaping hydrogen
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 280.05 281.44 <NA> <unk> like shown in red <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 281.24 291.73 <NA> and you can also see other features like oxygen and nitrogen in that white glimmer in the circle showing you the auroras and also some wisps around the tropics <unk>
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 291.68 304.28 <NA> <unk> so these are pictures that conclusively show us that our atmosphere isn 't just tightly bound to us here on earth but it 's actually reaching out far into space and at an alarming rate i might add
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 305.08 308.84 <NA> <unk> but the earth is not alone in undergoing atmospheric escape 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 308.44 316 <NA> mars our nearest neighbor <unk> is much smaller than earth <unk> so it has much less gravity with which to hold on to its atmosphere 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 315.81 327.38 <NA> and so even though mars has an atmosphere we can see it 's much thinner than the earth 's just look at the surface <unk> you see craters indicating that it didn 't have an atmosphere that could stop those impacts 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 327.38 329.82 <NA> also we see that it 's the red planet
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 329.84 334.31 <NA> and atmospheric escape plays a role in mars being red 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 334.12 342.49 <NA> that 's because we think mars used to have a wetter past and when water had enough energy it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 342.49 348.4 <NA> and hydrogen being so light <unk> it escaped into space and the oxygen that was left
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 348.17 353.92 <NA> oxidized or rusted the ground making that that familiar rusty red color that we see
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 354.9 363.32 <NA> <unk> so it 's fine to look at pictures of mars and say that atmospheric escape probably happened but nasa has a probe that 's currently at mars called the maven satellite 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 363.32 371.68 <NA> and its actual job is to study atmospheric escape <unk> it 's the mars atmosphere and volatile evolution spacecraft <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 371.19 374.99 <NA> and results from it have already shown pictures very
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 375 377.09 <NA> similar to what you 've seen here on earth <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 376.89 390.34 <NA> we 've long known that mars was losing its atmosphere but we have some stunning pictures here for example you can see in the red circle is the size of mars and in blue you can see the hydrogen escaping away from the planet <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 390.35 398.79 <NA> so it 's reaching out more than ten times the size of the planet <unk> far enough away that it 's no longer bound to that planet <unk> it 's escaping off into space 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 398.61 404.18 <NA> and this helps us confirm ideas like why mars is red from that lost hydrogen 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 405.14 413.97 <NA> <unk> isn 't the only gas that 's lost i mentioned helium on earth and some oxygen and nitrogen and from maven we can also look at the oxygen being lost from mars 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 413.97 419.43 <NA> and you can see that because oxygen is heavier <unk> it can 't get as far as the hydrogen 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 419.24 424.99 <NA> but it 's still escaping away from the planet you don 't see it all confined into that red circle
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 425.82 431.62 <NA> <unk> so the fact that we not only see atmospheric escape on our own planet but we can study it elsewhere
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 431.45 440.65 <NA> and send spacecraft allows us to learn about the past of planets but also about planets in general and earth 's future <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 440.19 446.89 <NA> so one way we actually can learn about the future is by planets so far away that we can 't see 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 446.97 449.93 <NA> and i should just note though before i go on to
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 450.46 463.25 <NA> <unk> i 'm not going to show you photos like this of pluto <unk> which might be disappointing <unk> but that 's because we don 't have them yet but the new horizons mission is currently studying atmospheric escape being lost from the planet <unk> so stay tuned and look out for that 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 463.06 474.59 <NA> but the planets that i did want to talk about are known as transiting exoplanets so any planet orbiting a star that 's not our sun is called an exoplanet or extrasolar planet <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 474.58 476.34 <NA> and these planets
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 476.12 479.97 <NA> that we call transiting have the special feature that if you look at that star in the middle
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 480.01 482.94 <NA> you 'll see that actually it 's blinking <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 482.6 496.59 <NA> and the reason that it 's blinking is because there are planets that are going past it all the time and it 's that special orientation where the planets are blocking the light from the star that allows us to see that light blinking 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 496.49 504.79 <NA> and by surveying the stars in the night sky for this blinking motion we are able to find planets this is how we 've now been able to detect
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 504.9 506.96 <NA> <unk> over five thousand planets
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 506.78 511.92 <NA> in our own milky way <unk> and we know there are many more out there like i mentioned so
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 511.76 522.19 <NA> when we look at the light from these stars what we see like i said is not the planet itself <unk> but you actually see a dimming of the light that we can record in time <unk> so the light <unk>
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 522.14 529.85 <NA> drops as the planet decreases in front of the star and that 's that blinking that you saw before so not only do we detect the planets but we can look at
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 529.96 536 <NA> <unk> light in different wavelengths <unk> so i mentioned looking at the earth and mars in ultraviolet light 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 536 550.08 <NA> if we look at transiting exoplanets with the hubble space telescope <unk> we find that in the ultraviolet you see much bigger blinking much less light from the star when the planet is passing in front <unk> and we think this is because you have an extended atmosphere
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 550 556.29 <NA> <unk> of hydrogen all around the planet that 's making it look <unk> puffier and thus blocking more of the light that you see <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 556.4 563.94 <NA> so using this technique we 've actually been able to discover a few transiting exoplanets that are undergoing atmospheric escape <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 563.6 575.07 <NA> and these planets can be called hot jupiters for some of the ones we 've found <unk> and that 's because they 're gas planets like jupiter <unk> but they 're so close to their star about a hundred times closer than jupiter <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 575.07 579.97 <NA> and because there 's all this lightweight gas that 's ready to escape and all this heating from the star
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 579.75 589.96 <NA> <unk> star you have completely catastrophic rates of atmospheric escape <unk> so unlike our four hundred pounds per minute of hydrogen being lost on earth for these planets <unk>
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 589.91 594.73 <NA> you 're losing one point three billion pounds of hydrogen every minute <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 604.96 614.4 <NA> <unk> rocky and planets further away are bigger and more gaseous could you have started with something like jupiter that was actually close to the sun and get rid of all the gas in it 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 614.19 622.65 <NA> we now think that if you start with something like a hot jupiter <unk> you actually can 't end up with mercury or the earth but if you started with something smaller 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 622.65 629.79 <NA> it 's possible that enough gas would have gotten away that it would have significantly impacted it and left you with something very different than what you
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 630.11 633.5 <NA> <unk> with so all of this sounds sort of general and
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 633.28 638.22 <NA> we might think about the solar system <unk> but what does this have to do with us here on earth <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 637.85 647.52 <NA> well in the far future the sun is going to get brighter <unk> and as that happens the heating that we find from the sun is going to become very intense <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 647.12 654.94 <NA> in the same way that you see gas streaming off from a hot jupiter gas is going to stream off from the earth and so what
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 654.99 663.19 <NA> <unk> can look forward to or at least prepare for is the fact that in the far future the earth is going to look more like mars 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 662.73 664.5 <NA> our hydrogen 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 664.5 672.88 <NA> from water that is broken down is going to escape into space more rapidly <unk> and we 're going to be left with this dry <unk> reddish planet <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 672.54 674.93 <NA> so don 't fear <unk> it 's not for a few
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 675.58 677.9 <NA> <unk> there 's some time to prepare 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 677.74 685.36 <NA> but i wanted you to be aware of what 's going on not just in the future <unk> but atmospheric escape is happening as we speak <unk> 
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 685.37 697.73 <NA> so there 's a lot of amazing science that you hear about happening in space and planets that are far away <unk> and we are studying these planets to learn about these worlds <unk> but as we learn about mars or exoplanets
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 697.3 701.99 <NA> like hot jupiters <unk> we find things like atmospheric escape
AnjaliTripathi_2015X 1 AnjaliTripathi_2015X 701.5 710.37 <NA> that tell us a lot more about our planet here on earth <unk> so consider that the next time you think that space is far away <unk> thank you
