NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 44.99 50.11 <NA> and today forty five years later we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 52.05 57.73 <NA> <unk> what we do have is improved technology today we don 't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display we can use <unk>
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 59.46 63.97 <NA> <unk> are smaller they 're cheaper they 're longer lasting they 're more efficient 
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 63.54 72.49 <NA> most importantly for this they 're faster <unk> and this speed combined with today 's <unk> high performance micro controllers allows us to actually simulate 
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 72.06 75.05 <NA> in this piece over seventeen thousand
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 78.19 86.66 <NA> <unk> and the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision but as this ring rotates at about one thousand seven hundred rpm that 's <unk> twenty eight times per second 
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 86.44 90.05 <NA> the equator 's speed is actually about sixty miles per hour
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 89.72 90.77 <NA> there are four <unk>
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 92.19 99.93 <NA> that each time this ring rotates it as it passes the rear of the display it picks up a position signal and from that 
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 101.48 103.89 <NA> <unk> can extrapolate the position of the ring
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 103.52 106.03 <NA> at all points around the revolution
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 105.85 111.45 <NA> and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations but this is really just the beginning 
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 111.56 120.69 <NA> in addition to higher resolution versions of this display <unk> my father and i are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 120.44 128.38 <NA> it achieves this by rotating leds about two axes so as you can see here this is a eleven inch diameter circuit board these blocks represent
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 129.96 134.68 <NA> <unk> you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis it will create
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 134.28 138.91 <NA> a disc of light that we can control that 's nothing new that 's a propeller clock that 's
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 138.48 145.9 <NA> the rims that you can buy for your car but what is new is that when we rotate this disc about this axis
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 145.44 150.11 <NA> this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light and so we can control
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 151.75 155.09 <NA> <unk> and create a fully volumetric three dimensional display with just two hundred and <unk>
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 156.37 160.85 <NA> now this piece is currently in process due out in may
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 160.42 168.5 <NA> but what we 've done is we 've put together a small demo just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere <unk>
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 168.1 170.7 <NA> i 've got a little video to show you but
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 170.52 174.99 <NA> keep in mind that this is with no electronic control <unk> and this is also with only four
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 175.49 180.36 <NA> <unk> this is actually only about one point five percent of what the final display will be in may so take a look <unk> 
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 182.48 187.68 <NA> and here you can see it 's rotating about the vertical axis only creating circles <unk> 
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 190.34 195.18 <NA> and then as the other axis kicks in those actually blur into a volume and
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 194.75 204.79 <NA> the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case <unk> but this piece is due out in may it 'll be on display at the interactive telecommunications spring show in
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 204.84 211.45 <NA> <unk> greenwich village in new york city that 's open to the public definitely invite you all to come and attend it 's a fantastic show there are
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 211.29 214.85 <NA> hundreds of student innovators with with fantastic projects 
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 214.85 221.77 <NA> this piece actually <unk> will be on display down in the sierra simulcast lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show so i 'd
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 221.34 225.04 <NA> love to talk to you all and invite you to come down and take a closer look it
NickSears_2007 1 NickSears_2007 224.82 226.64 <NA> 's an honor to be here thanks very much
