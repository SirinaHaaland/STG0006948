FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 13.09 20.39 <NA> <unk> i design engineering projects for middle school and high school students <unk> often using materials that are pretty unexpected 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 20.5 29.58 <NA> my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life for example one time i needed a costume to go to a comic convention
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 30.08 37.08 <NA> <unk> but i didn 't want to spend too much money <unk> so i made my own with a light up crown and skirt 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 38.18 47.1 <NA> another time i was devastated because my favorite mobile game flappy bird was being taken off the app store 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 47.78 54.22 <NA> laughter so i was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play flappy bird again
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 56.79 61.64 <NA> laughter unhappy with both options i did the only thing that made sense to me 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 61.64 66.05 <NA> i made a physical version of flappy bird that could never be taken off the app store
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 93.28 98.15 <NA> <unk> and they told me that it was just as infuriating as the original game 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 98.47 104.25 <NA> laughter so i uploaded a demo of this project online <unk> and to my surprise
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 103.97 104.97 <NA> it went viral
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 105.01 108.3 <NA> it had over two million views in just a few days 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 109.04 112.61 <NA> and what 's more interesting are people 's comments 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 112.62 124.02 <NA> a lot of people wanted to make it their own or asked me how it was made so this kind of confirmed my idea that through a creative project we can teach people about engineering
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 123.92 129.88 <NA> with the money made from the viral video <unk> we were able to let students in our classroom all make their own
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 129.84 131.44 <NA> <unk> game in a box <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 131.07 136.94 <NA> although it was pretty challenging they learned a lot of new concepts in engineering and programming <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 136.94 140.8 <NA> and they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 141.93 149.78 <NA> so before flappy bird box <unk> i had the idea of using creative engineering projects to teach
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 150.58 152.87 <NA> <unk> when i was teaching at a middle school
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 152.38 160.55 <NA> we asked our students to build a robot from a standard technology kit <unk> and i noticed that a lot of them seemed bored 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 160.38 169.52 <NA> then a few of them started taking pieces of paper and decorating their robots and then more of them got into it and they became more interested in the project <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 169.52 175.55 <NA> so i started looking for more creative ways to introduce technology to students
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 175.06 179.91 <NA> what i found was that most technology kits available in school look
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 179.93 185.28 <NA> <unk> a little intimidating they 're all made of plastic parts that you can 't customize 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 185.09 195.21 <NA> on top of that they 're all very expensive costing hundreds of dollars per kit <unk> so that 's certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 194.81 204.97 <NA> since i didn 't find anything i decided to make something on my own <unk> i started with paper and fabric <unk> after all we all played with those since we were kids
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 205.01 210.04 <NA> and they are also pretty cheap and can be found anywhere around the house <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 209.7 216.85 <NA> and i prototyped a project where students can create a light up creature using fabric and googly eyes <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 216.6 225.08 <NA> they were all helping each other in classrooms and were laughing and discussing the project <unk> and most importantly they were able to insert their own creativity into
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 226.63 233.16 <NA> <unk> so because of the success of this project i continued to create more engineering projects to challenge my students <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 233.16 241.2 <NA> and i also started to take these workshops outside of school and into the community and something really interesting happened 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 240.75 246.45 <NA> i noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 246.45 251.42 <NA> and specifically <unk> there were a lot more women and minorities
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 251.05 254.79 <NA> than i expected <unk> and that you wouldn 't usually see at a
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 254.75 256.83 <NA> <unk> traditional engineering workshop 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 256.76 263.19 <NA> now take a look at this employee report at a major technology company in two thousand and sixteen 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 262.7 271.2 <NA> women make up only nineteen percent of the technology workforce <unk> and underrepresented minorities make up only four percent 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 270.95 279.1 <NA> this statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club or a college engineering class
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 279.66 285.68 <NA> <unk> now <unk> there 's a wide variety of problems that contribute to
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 285.5 295.6 <NA> the lack of diversity in the technology force <unk> perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 295.41 304.04 <NA> i 'm not saying that this could solve everything but it could introduce technology to people who originally wouldn 't be
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 304.87 308.36 <NA> <unk> because of how it has been portrayed and taught in school 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 308.26 313.52 <NA> so how do we start to change the perception of technology 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 313.42 323.75 <NA> most students think that it 's boring or unwelcoming <unk> so i have always designed projects following three principles first is having <unk>
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 323.65 327.98 <NA> <unk> a low floor <unk> and that means this project is easy to get started 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 329.9 331.86 <NA> <unk> look at this tutorial
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 331.4 335.91 <NA> <unk> the first project we asked students to learn is to make a circuit on paper 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 335.91 341.43 <NA> as you can see it doesn 't take very long to learn and it 's pretty easy even for beginners <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 341.3 349.87 <NA> and having a low floor also means that we 're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project <unk> so with
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 350.46 357.04 <NA> <unk> copper tape lightbulb and a battery people can complete this project for under a dollar <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 356.76 362.45 <NA> so second principle is having a high ceiling this means that
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 362.06 366.58 <NA> there 's a lot of room to grow and students are constantly being challenged
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 366.9 376.25 <NA> at first it might just be a light up creature but then you can add sensors and microcontrollers and start to program the creature to interact with its environment
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 379.69 383.72 <NA> <unk> principle is customization this means that
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 383.41 393.11 <NA> we can make this project relevant to anyone that 's the beauty of using everyday materials it 's very easy to customize using paper and fabric <unk> 
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 392.65 397.89 <NA> so even if you don 't like <unk> flappy bird you can still make your own game
FawnQiu_2016S 1 FawnQiu_2016S 405.41 408.85 <NA> <unk> the object is to prevent him from getting caught by the lapd
