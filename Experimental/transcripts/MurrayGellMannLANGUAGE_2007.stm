MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 51.92 55 <NA> and i would love to see where that leads
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 54.75 58.66 <NA> <unk> leads does it really lead to a single ancestor
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 58.29 59.95 <NA> some
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 59.49 65.08 <NA> twenty twenty five thousand years ago and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 64.62 67.9 <NA> when there was presumably a competition among many
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 67.44 75.79 <NA> languages how far back does that go how far back does modern language go how many tens of thousands of years does it go back
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 75.78 79.67 <NA> do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is murray gell mann well i would guess that
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 80.04 82.22 <NA> that modern language must be older
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 82.22 93.68 <NA> than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the in the soft clay in the caves in western europe in the aurignacian period some

MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 96.55 104.85 <NA> i can 't believe they did all those things and didn 't also have a modern language so i would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 104.99 118.92 <NA> <unk> but that doesn 't mean that all or many or most of today 's attested languages couldn 't descend perhaps from one that 's much younger than that like say twenty thousand years or something of that kind it 's what we call a bottleneck
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 1 MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007 119.09 125.68 <NA> well philip anderson may have been right you may just know more about everything than anyone so it 's been an honor thank you
