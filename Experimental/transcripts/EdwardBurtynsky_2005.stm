EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1795.98 1804.94 <NA> <unk> one that i 'm trying to work with and this one is i wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1804.93 1807.7 <NA> <unk> on and invent ideas on sustainability <unk> 
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1808.05 1817.55 <NA> and one of the things that came out allison who actually nominated me <unk> said something earlier on in a brainstorming she said that recycling in canada had a fantastic entry
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1817.33 1820.93 <NA> into our psyche through
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1820.86 1825.02 <NA> kids between grade four and six and
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1828.49 1832.19 <NA> <unk> age seven is the age of reason so they 're into the age of reason <unk> and <unk>
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1833.46 1843.23 <NA> so it 's this great window where they actually are you can influence them <unk> you know what happens at puberty you know we know that from earlier presentations so my
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1843.01 1849.14 <NA> my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1849.13 1854.97 <NA> to start driving home ideas let them understand what sustainability is and that they have a vested interest in it to
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1854.96 1856.39 <NA> <unk> happen <unk> and one of the
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1856.21 1861.48 <NA> ways i thought of doing it is to use my prize so i would take
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1861.48 1872.46 <NA> thirty thousand or forty thousand dollars of the winnings and the rest is going to be to manage this project but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands <unk> but the other thing that i thought would be fantastic was to create these
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1872.3 1879.43 <NA> call them prize targets and so one could be for the best sustainable sustainable idea for an
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1880.16 1881.83 <NA> the best
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1881.52 1887.09 <NA> one for a household project <unk> or it could be the best community project for sustainability <unk> 
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1887.09 1891.89 <NA> and i also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for in my world 
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1891.7 1896.2 <NA> and what would happen it 's a scalable thing and
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1896.04 1899.87 <NA> if we can get people to put in things whether it 's equipment like a
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1901.81 1909.11 <NA> <unk> to make the prize significant enough and to open it up to all the schools that that are public schools or schools
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1908.77 1919.19 <NA> that are with kids that age and make it a wide open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them and the prize has to be a verifiable thing so it 's not about <unk>
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1919.14 1925.02 <NA> just ideas the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them but the actual things have to be
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1926.42 1929.08 <NA> <unk> that way what 's happening is that we 're motivating
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1928.9 1935.49 <NA> a certain age group to start thinking and they 're going to push that up from the bottom up into 
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1935.27 1946.2 <NA> i believe into the households and parents will be reacting to it and trying to help them with the projects <unk> and i think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1945.95 1949.99 <NA> in a very positive way and starts to teach them <unk> they know
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1950 1956.98 <NA> <unk> about recycling now <unk> but they don 't really i think get sustainability in all the things and the energy footprint and how that matters 
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1956.98 1961.01 <NA> and to teach them to me would be a fantastic
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1960.53 1965.47 <NA> wish and it would be something that i would certainly put my shoulder into 
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1965.01 1974.93 <NA> and again in in my world the competition we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it and i like the words in my world because it gives possession
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1974.74 1979.97 <NA> of the world to the person who 's doing it it is my world it 's not someone else 's i want to help
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1979.99 1983.54 <NA> <unk> it i want to do something with it so i think it has
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1983.2 1995.1 <NA> a great opportunity to engage the imaginations and great ideas i think come from kids and engage their imagination into a project and do something for schools i think all schools could use
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1995.1 1999.08 <NA> extra equipment extra cash it 's going to be an incentive for them
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1998.77 2000.2 <NA> to do that
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2000.7 2003.11 <NA> <unk> these are some of the the ideas
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2003.01 2006.05 <NA> in terms of where we could possibly
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2005.95 2009.59 <NA> put in some some promotion for in my world 
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2009.79 2018.69 <NA> and wish three is imax film <unk> <unk> so i was told i should do one for myself and i 've always wanted to actually get involved
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2018.52 2024.96 <NA> with doing something and the scale of my work and the kinds of ideas i 'm playing with when i first saw an imax film i
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2025.88 2033.75 <NA> <unk> there 's a real resonance between what i 'm trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a <unk> photographer and i think there 's a real possibility
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2033.35 2039.99 <NA> to reach new audiences if i had a chance so i 'm looking really for a mentor because i
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2039.68 2046.89 <NA> just had my birthday <unk> i 'm fifty and i don 't have time to go back to school right now i 'm too busy <unk> so i need somebody who can put me on
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2046.67 2048.3 <NA> a quick
EdwardBurtynsky_2005 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2005 2048.26 2058.15 <NA> catch up course on how to do something like that and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this that would be fantastic so those are my three wishes
