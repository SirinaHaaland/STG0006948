AnantAgarwal_2013G 1 AnantAgarwal_2013G 562.58 565.95 <NA> the second idea is self pacing 
AnantAgarwal_2013G 1 AnantAgarwal_2013G 565.85 575.11 <NA> now when i went to a lecture hall and if you were like me by the fifth minute i would lose the professor <unk> i wasn 't all that smart and i would be scrambling taking notes <unk> and then i would lose
AnantAgarwal_2013G 1 AnantAgarwal_2013G 575.97 585.58 <NA> <unk> the rest of the hour instead wouldn 't it be nice with online technologies we offer videos and interactive engagements to students <unk> they can hit the pause button <unk>
