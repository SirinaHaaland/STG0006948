RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 21.7 28.1 <NA> piercing through an apple and exposure just a millionth of a second <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 29.84 35.31 <NA> <unk> now <unk> fifty years later we can go a million times faster
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 36.11 38.19 <NA> and see the world
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 37.79 39.93 <NA> not at a million
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 39.5 47.24 <NA> or a billion but one trillion frames per second <unk> i present to you
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 47.24 49.96 <NA> a new type of photography 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 51.54 55.18 <NA> <unk> a new imaging technique so fast
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 55.8 60.91 <NA> that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 60.9 70.48 <NA> and with that we can create cameras that can look around corners <unk> beyond line of sight <unk> or see inside our body
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 70.35 79.94 <NA> without an x ray and really challenge what we mean by a camera now if i take a laser pointer
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 79.89 87.14 <NA> and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second which is several femtoseconds
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 86.68 91.61 <NA> i 'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 91.93 100.11 <NA> and that packet of photons that bullet will travel at the speed of light <unk> and again a million times faster than an ordinary
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 102.68 107.49 <NA> <unk> if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 107.15 116.26 <NA> into this bottle <unk> how will those photons shatter into this bottle <unk> how does light look in slow motion
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 146.61 154.97 <NA> <unk> now remember the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond that 's how much time it takes for light to travel but i 'm slowing
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 154.93 155.98 <NA> <unk> down
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 155.58 161.81 <NA> in this video by a factor of ten billion <unk> so you can see the light in motion 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 162.16 165.53 <NA> but coca cola did not sponsor this research 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 166.57 179.97 <NA> now there 's a lot going on in this movie so let me break this down and show you what 's going on so the pulse enters the bottle our bullet with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside some of the light leaks
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 179.75 183.7 <NA> <unk> leaks goes on the table and you start seeing these ripples of waves <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 183.52 194.19 <NA> many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions <unk> as you can see there 's a bubble of air and it 's bouncing around inside meanwhile <unk>
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 194.14 200.29 <NA> <unk> the ripples are traveling on the table and because of the reflections at the top you see at the back of the bottle <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 205.14 209.44 <NA> <unk> now if you take an ordinary bullet
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 210.18 218.5 <NA> and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of ten billion do you know how long you 'll have to sit here
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 218.28 220.78 <NA> to watch that movie 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 221.4 228.65 <NA> a day a week actually a whole year <unk> it 'll be a very boring movie
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 229.93 235.89 <NA> <unk> slow ordinary bullet in motion <unk> and what about some
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 237.18 238.46 <NA> photography 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 244.6 250.11 <NA> you can watch the ripples again <unk> washing over the table
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 250.13 255.96 <NA> <unk> the tomato and the wall in the back it 's like throwing a stone in a pond of water 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 258.92 261.43 <NA> i thought this is how nature
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 261.43 270.39 <NA> paints a photo one femto frame at a time <unk> but of course our eye sees an integral composite <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 271.46 279.97 <NA> but if you look at this tomato one more time you will notice as the light washes over the tomato <unk> it continues to glow it doesn 't become dark why is that
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 280.13 289.21 <NA> because the tomato is actually ripe and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato and it comes out after several trillionths of a second <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 289.14 291.4 <NA> so in the future <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 291.03 299.29 <NA> when this femto camera is in your camera phone you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 300.3 304.28 <NA> so how did my team at mit create this camera
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 305.41 311.73 <NA> now as photographers you know if you take a short exposure photo you get very little light <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 311.52 315.06 <NA> but we 're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure so you
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 314.85 316.92 <NA> 're going to get hardly any light <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 316.92 329.91 <NA> so what we do is we send that bullet that packet of photons millions of times and record again and again with very clever synchronization and from the gigabytes of data <unk> we computationally weave together to create
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 330.1 332.37 <NA> femto videos i showed you 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 332.75 337.71 <NA> and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 337.46 342.54 <NA> so superman can fly some other heroes can become invisible 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 342.17 349.56 <NA> but what about a new power for a future superhero to see around corners <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 349.64 354.94 <NA> the idea is that we could shine some light on the door it 's going to
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 354.9 364.6 <NA> <unk> bounce go inside the room some of that is going to reflect back on the door <unk> and then back to the camera <unk> and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 364.14 369.36 <NA> and it 's not science fiction we have actually built it on the left you see our femto camera 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 369.36 374.65 <NA> there 's a mannequin hidden behind a wall <unk> and we 're going to bounce light off the door <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 389.95 394.88 <NA> <unk> going to fire those bullets of light <unk> and they 're going to hit this wall <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 395.83 400.02 <NA> and because of the packet of the photons <unk> they will scatter in all the
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 401.06 405.81 <NA> <unk> some of them will reach our hidden mannequin which in turn will again scatter that light
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 406.37 412.11 <NA> <unk> and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 412.28 420.42 <NA> and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera <unk> but most interestingly they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 425.3 428.47 <NA> and because we have a camera that can run so fast our
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 429.93 437.44 <NA> <unk> some unique abilities <unk> it has very good time resolution <unk> and it can look at the world at the speed of light <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 437.61 440.47 <NA> and this way we know the distances 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 440.47 446.08 <NA> of course to the door but also to the hidden objects <unk> but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 450.03 454.91 <NA> by shining one laser we can record one raw photo <unk> which if you look on the screen
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 454.89 456.59 <NA> 't really make any sense 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 456.39 464.63 <NA> but then we will take a lot of such pictures <unk> dozens of such pictures <unk> put them together and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light <unk> and from that 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 464.63 469.76 <NA> can we see the hidden object can we see it in full 3d 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 469.6 471.63 <NA> so this is our reconstruction
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 484.97 494.88 <NA> <unk> we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road <unk> but in the future we could create cars that avoid collisions with what 's around the bend <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 495.11 504.97 <NA> or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows <unk> or we can build endoscopes
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 505.4 509.28 <NA> that can see deep inside the body around occluders <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 509.29 522.98 <NA> and also for cardioscopes <unk> but of course because of tissue and blood this is quite challenging <unk> so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about <unk> femto photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 536.5 541.76 <NA> <unk> all the gigabytes of data that we 're collecting every time are not just for scientific imaging <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 541.75 547.01 <NA> but we can also do a new form of computational photography <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 547.06 550.49 <NA> with time lapse and color coding <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 550.72 554.79 <NA> and we look at those ripples remember <unk> the time between each of
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 554.9 559.38 <NA> <unk> ripples is only a few trillionths of a second <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 560.18 568.29 <NA> but there 's also something funny going on here <unk> when you look at the ripples under the cap the ripples are moving away from us <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 568.43 574.45 <NA> the ripples should be moving towards us what 's going on here <unk> it turns out because we 're recording
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 574.24 576.75 <NA> nearly at the speed of light <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 578.51 579.97 <NA> we have strange effects
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 579.6 584.71 <NA> <unk> effects and einstein would have loved to see this picture 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 584.64 592.09 <NA> the order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 592.5 598.87 <NA> so by applying the corresponding space and time warp we can correct for this distortion <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 600 604.19 <NA> so whether it 's for photography around corners
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 604.99 611.36 <NA> <unk> or creating the next generation of health imaging <unk> or creating new visualizations <unk> 
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 611.47 619.32 <NA> since our invention <unk> we have open sourced all the data and details on our website and our hope
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 619.15 623.66 <NA> is that the diy the creative
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 623.23 625.61 <NA> and the research communities
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 625.21 629.97 <NA> will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels
RameshRaskar_2012G 1 RameshRaskar_2012G 630.19 639.88 <NA> in cameras and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging <unk> it 's about time <unk> thank you
