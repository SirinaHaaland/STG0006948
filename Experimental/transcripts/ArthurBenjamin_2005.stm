ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 17.59 29.97 <NA> what that means is i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call mathemagics but before i get started i have a quick question for the audience by any chance did anyone happen to bring
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 29.93 32.94 <NA> <unk> with them this morning a calculator <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 32.69 41.4 <NA> seriously if you have a calculator with you raise your hand <unk> raise your hand did your hand go up now bring bring it out bring it out anybody else
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 41.21 48 <NA> <unk> i see i see one way in the back you sir <unk> that 's three <unk> and anybody on this side here <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 47.66 54.1 <NA> ok over there on the aisle would the four of you please bring out your calculators then join me up on stage let 's give
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 54.87 56.41 <NA> <unk> nice round of applause that 's right 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 59.25 68.78 <NA> now since i haven 't had the chance to work with these calculators i need to make sure that they are all working properly would somebody get us started by giving us a
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 80.04 87.02 <NA> thirty four or the calculators are not working do all of you get one thousand and thirty four one thousand and thirty four volunteer no ab 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 86.83 91.28 <NA> five hundred and ninety four let 's give three of them a nice round of applause there 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 92.77 102.92 <NA> would you like to try a more standard calculator just in case ok great what i 'm going to try and do then i notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that 's ok i
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 102.92 104.97 <NA> 'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 105.07 107.01 <NA> even faster on the calculator 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 107.01 115.87 <NA> there is something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself for instance five squared would be audience twenty five
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 115.63 125.32 <NA> ab twenty five the way we can square on most calculators let me demonstrate with this one is by taking the number such as five <unk> hitting times and then equals
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 125.46 138.29 <NA> <unk> and on most calculators that will give you the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you 've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do the calculation even faster what i 'm going to try and do now is to square in my head
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 139.41 146.86 <NA> <unk> numbers faster than they can do on their calculators even using the shortcut method what i 'll use is the second row this time and i 'll get four of you <unk>
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 147.83 154.97 <NA> to each yell out a two digit number and if you would square the first number and if you would square the second the third
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 155.02 159.93 <NA> <unk> and the fourth i will try and race you to the answer ok so quickly a
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 187.4 200.02 <NA> <unk> let me try to take this one step further i 'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time <unk> i won 't even write these down i 'll just call them out as they 're called out to me anyone i point to call out a three digit number
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 200.22 204.14 <NA> <unk> anyone on our panel verify the answer just give some indication if it 's right a
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 243.4 246.87 <NA> <unk> 's a harder one is that five hundred and thirteen thousand two hundred
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 264.89 268.17 <NA> <unk> let me try to take this one step further 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 268.94 279.82 <NA> i 'm going to try to square a four digit number this time you can all take your time on this i will not beat you to the answer on this one <unk> but i will try to get the answer right to make this a little bit more
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 279.72 289.93 <NA> <unk> random let 's take the fourth row this time let 's say one two three four if each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine that will be the four digit number that i 'll square 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 289.83 298.1 <NA> nine <unk> seven <unk> five eight nine thousand seven hundred and fifty eight this will take me a little bit of time so bear with me
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 318.49 325.11 <NA> <unk> i would attempt to square a five digit number and i can but unfortunately most calculators
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 342.59 350.05 <NA> <unk> talk to you later in the meanwhile let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier <unk> let 's take the largest
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 352.65 367.5 <NA> <unk> would you each enter that on your calculator <unk> and instead of squaring it this time i want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want but don 't tell me what you 're multiplying by just multiply it by any random three digit number <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 367.5 372.97 <NA> so you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 372.51 374.84 <NA> how many digits do you have six or seven 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 388.78 393.02 <NA> <unk> then i shall attempt the impossible or at least the improbable <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 393.02 400.08 <NA> what i 'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits any six of them in any order
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 402.08 410.59 <NA> <unk> one digit at a time <unk> i shall try and determine the digit you 've left out starting with your seven digit number call out any six of them please
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 429.93 436.3 <NA> <unk> did you leave out the number six same as she did ok <unk> you 've got a seven digit number call out any six of them loud and clear volunteer zero seven nine zero four 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 440.04 442.69 <NA> four i think you left out the number three ab 
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 442.29 450.11 <NA> that 's three <unk> the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in ten thousand ten to the fourth power <unk> ok
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 457.96 463.77 <NA> <unk> you leave out the number seven <unk> and let 's give all four of these people a nice round of applause <unk> thank you very much

ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 742.02 749.09 <NA> add all those numbers together and with any luck arrive at the answer now let me recap
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 760.6 770.75 <NA> <unk> while i do these calculations you might hear certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is this is a phonetic <unk>
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 770.7 779.97 <NA> code a mnemonic device that i use that allows me to convert numbers into words i store them as words and later on retrieve them as numbers i know
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 779.99 785.28 <NA> <unk> sounds complicated it 's not i don 't want you to think you 're seeing something out of rain man

ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 810.45 817.25 <NA> <unk> 't tell me what the mistake is just say you 're close or something like that and i 'll try and figure out the answer which
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 830.05 837.3 <NA> <unk> so <unk> without any more stalling here we go i 'll start the problem in the middle
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 868.37 869.56 <NA> <unk> but i see a carry coming
ArthurBenjamin_2005 1 ArthurBenjamin_2005 880.8 887.39 <NA> <unk> that 's seven hundred times six hundred and sixty six plus seventeen squared is four hundred and sixty six thousand four hundred and eighty nine rev up if i need it rev up take the four
