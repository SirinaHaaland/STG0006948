MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 13.51 21.42 <NA> <unk> be talking about statistics today if that makes you immediately feel a little bit wary that 's ok <unk> that doesn 't make you some kind of crazy conspiracy theorist 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 21.42 25.11 <NA> it makes you skeptical <unk> and when it comes to numbers especially now
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 25.13 34.32 <NA> <unk> you should be skeptical <unk> but you should also be able to tell which numbers are reliable and which ones aren 't so today i want to try to give you some tools to be able to do that 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 33.89 37.96 <NA> but before i do i just want to clarify which numbers i 'm talking about here i
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 37.96 45.13 <NA> 'm not talking about claims like nine out of ten women recommend this anti aging cream i think a lot of us always roll our eyes at numbers like that 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 44.9 54.52 <NA> what 's different now is people are questioning statistics like the us unemployment rate is five percent what makes this claim different is it doesn 't come from a private company <unk> it comes from the government
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 55.19 64.6 <NA> about four out of ten americans distrust the economic data that gets reported by government among supporters of president trump it 's even higher it 's about seven out of ten
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 64.11 69.29 <NA> i don 't need to tell anyone here that there are a lot of dividing lines in our society right now 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 69.29 74.95 <NA> and a lot of them start to make sense <unk> once you understand people 's relationships with these government numbers
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 74.61 79.82 <NA> on the one hand <unk> there are those who say these statistics are crucial that we need them to make sense of
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 79.78 85.73 <NA> <unk> society as a whole in order to move beyond emotional anecdotes and measure progress in an [ objective ] way 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 85.24 94.94 <NA> and then there are the others who say that these statistics are elitist maybe even rigged <unk> they don 't make sense and they don 't really reflect what 's happening in people 's everyday lives
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 94.84 104.85 <NA> it kind of feels like that second group is winning the argument right now we 're living in a world of alternative facts where people don 't find statistics this kind of common ground this starting point for debate
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 105.08 106.69 <NA> this is a problem 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 106.48 115.09 <NA> there are actually moves in the us right now to get rid of some government statistics altogether right now there 's a bill in congress about measuring racial inequality 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 115.09 125.38 <NA> the draft law says that government money should not be used to collect data on racial segregation <unk> this is a total disaster if we don 't have this data how can we observe discrimination
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 125.46 132.85 <NA> <unk> let alone fix it in other words how can a government create fair policies if they can 't measure current levels of unfairness
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 132.45 146.17 <NA> this isn 't just about discrimination it 's everything think about it how can we legislate on health care if we don 't have good data on health or poverty how can we have public debate about immigration if we can 't at least agree on how many people are entering and leaving the country 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 145.71 150.02 <NA> statistics come from the state that 's where they got their name the point was to better
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 150 152.99 <NA> <unk> measure the population in order to better serve it
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 152.65 161.82 <NA> so we need these government numbers but we also have to move beyond either blindly accepting or blindly rejecting them we need to learn the skills to be able to spot bad statistics 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 161.82 167.06 <NA> i started to learn some of these when i was working in a statistical department that 's part of the united nations
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 166.75 174.87 <NA> our job was to find out how many iraqis had been forced from their homes as a result of the war and what they needed <unk> it was really important work but it was also
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 176.24 180.42 <NA> <unk> every single day we were making decisions that affected the accuracy of our numbers
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 180.19 185.85 <NA> decisions like which parts of the country we should go to who we should speak to which questions we should ask 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 185.66 191.22 <NA> and i started to feel really disillusioned with our work <unk> because we thought we were doing a really good job <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 191.22 198.15 <NA> but the one group of people who could really tell us were the iraqis and they rarely got the chance to find our analysis let alone question it <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 197.75 204.97 <NA> so i started to feel really determined that the one way to make numbers more accurate is to have as many people as possible be able to question them
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 205.07 210.82 <NA> <unk> so i became a data journalist my job is finding these data sets and sharing them with the public
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 210.45 220.9 <NA> anyone can do this you don 't have to be a geek or a nerd you can ignore those words they 're used by people trying to say they 're smart while pretending they 're humble absolutely anyone can do this <unk>
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 220.47 224.9 <NA> i want to give you guys three questions that will help you be able to spot some bad
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 226.21 229.36 <NA> <unk> question number one is can you see uncertainty
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 229.37 236.9 <NA> one of things that 's really changed people 's relationship with numbers and even their trust in the media <unk> has been the use of political polls
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 236.44 239.94 <NA> i personally have a lot of issues with political polls because
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 239.58 243.95 <NA> i think the role of journalists is actually to report the facts and not attempt to predict them <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 243.95 254.01 <NA> especially when those predictions can actually damage democracy by signaling to people don 't bother to vote for that guy he doesn 't have a chance let 's set that aside for now and talk about the accuracy of this endeavor
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 255.05 256.6 <NA> <unk> based on national elections
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 256.42 258.99 <NA> in the uk <unk> italy
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 258.8 262.39 <NA> <unk> israel and of course the most recent us presidential election 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 262.39 268.71 <NA> using polls to predict electoral outcomes is about as accurate as using the moon to predict hospital admissions 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 268.37 272.58 <NA> no seriously i used actual data from an academic study to draw this 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 272.58 279.97 <NA> there are a lot of reasons why polling has become so inaccurate our societies have become really diverse which makes it difficult for pollsters
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 279.9 289.27 <NA> <unk> to get a really nice representative sample of the population for their polls people are really reluctant to answer their phones to pollsters and also shockingly enough people might lie <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 288.87 291.98 <NA> but you wouldn 't necessarily know that to look at the media 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 291.98 300.2 <NA> for one thing the probability of a hillary clinton win was communicated with decimal places we don 't use decimal places to describe the temperature
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 300.37 306.17 <NA> <unk> how on earth can predicting the behavior of two hundred and thirty million voters in this country be that precise <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 306.1 308.41 <NA> and then there were those sleek charts 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 308.25 315.08 <NA> see a lot of data visualizations will overstate certainty <unk> and it works these charts can numb our brains to criticism 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 315.08 322.73 <NA> when you hear a statistic you might feel skeptical as soon as it 's buried in a chart it feels like some kind of objective science <unk> and it 's not 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 322.33 329.88 <NA> so i was trying to find ways to better communicate this to people to show people the uncertainty in our numbers what i did was i started taking
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 329.99 340.2 <NA> <unk> data sets and turning them into hand drawn visualizations so that people can see how imprecise the data is so people can see that a human did this a human found the data and visualized it
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 339.74 348.84 <NA> for example instead of finding out the probability of getting the flu in any given month <unk> you can see the rough distribution of flu season <unk> this is 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 348.44 349.96 <NA> a bad shot to show in
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 351.51 359.77 <NA> <unk> also more responsible data visualization because if you were to show the exact probabilities <unk> maybe that would encourage people to get their flu jabs at the wrong time
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 359.88 370.48 <NA> the point of these shaky lines is so that people remember these these imprecisions but also so they don 't necessarily walk away with a specific number but they can remember important facts 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 370.47 374.93 <NA> facts like injustice and inequality leave a huge mark on our lives <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 374.69 379.97 <NA> facts like black americans and native americans have shorter life expectancies than those of other
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 379.9 382.67 <NA> <unk> races <unk> and that isn 't changing anytime soon 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 382.21 390.14 <NA> facts like prisoners in the us can be kept in solitary confinement cells that are smaller than the size of an average parking space
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 389.95 400.02 <NA> the point of these visualizations is also to remind people of some really important statistical concepts <unk> concepts like averages so let 's say you hear a claim like the average
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 400 409.05 <NA> swimming pool in the us contains six point two three fecal accidents that doesn 't mean every single swimming pool in the country contains exactly six point two three turds <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 408.59 420.69 <NA> so in order to show that i went back to the original data which comes from the cdc who surveyed forty seven swimming facilities <unk> and i just spent one evening redistributing poop <unk> so you can kind of see how misleading averages can be
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 420.8 429.04 <NA> ok <unk> so the second question that you guys should be asking yourselves to spot bad numbers is can i see myself in the data
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 429.96 432.03 <NA> <unk> is also about averages in a way 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 431.81 436.01 <NA> because part of the reason why people are so frustrated with these national statistics 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 435.83 440.41 <NA> is they don 't really tell the story of who 's winning and who 's losing from national policy it
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 440.41 446.17 <NA> 's easy to understand why people are frustrated with global averages when they don 't match up with their personal experiences <unk>
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 446.07 450.02 <NA> i wanted to show people the way data relates to their everyday lives <unk>
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 450 461 <NA> i started this advice column called dear mona where people would write to me with questions and concerns and i 'd try to answer them with data people asked me anything questions like is it normal to sleep in a separate bed to my wife 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 461 462.9 <NA> do people regret their tattoos 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 462.72 465.29 <NA> what does it mean to die of natural causes 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 464.83 474.81 <NA> all of these questions are great because they make you think about ways to find and communicate these numbers if someone asks you how much pee is a lot of pee which is a question that i got asked
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 475.7 483.08 <NA> <unk> you really want to make sure that the visualization makes sense to as many people as possible these numbers aren 't unavailable <unk> sometimes they 're just
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 482.92 492.9 <NA> buried in the appendix of an academic study and they 're certainly not inscrutable if you really wanted to test these numbers on urination volume you could grab a bottle and try it for yourself 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 492.89 497.94 <NA> the point of this isn 't necessarily that every single data set has to relate specifically to you 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 497.94 504.97 <NA> i 'm interested in how many women were issued fines in france for wearing the face veil or the niqab even if i don 't live in france or wear the face veil
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 505.41 509.64 <NA> the point of asking where you fit in is to get as much context as possible so it
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 509.64 515.9 <NA> 's about zooming out from one data point like the unemployment rate is five percent and seeing how it changes over time 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 515.69 521.62 <NA> or seeing how it changes by educational status this is why your parents always wanted you to go to college
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 521.19 529.97 <NA> or seeing how it varies by gender <unk> nowadays male unemployment rate is higher than the female unemployment rate up until the early ' 80s it was the other way around
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 530.01 537.14 <NA> this is a story of one of the biggest changes that 's happened in american society and it 's all there in that chart <unk> once you look beyond the averages 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 536.68 541.4 <NA> the axes are everything <unk> once you change the scale <unk> you can change the story <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 540.97 548.63 <NA> ok so the third and final question that i want you guys to think about when you 're looking at statistics is how was the data collected
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 548.65 550.02 <NA> <unk> so far
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 550.04 561.43 <NA> <unk> only talked about the way data is communicated but the way it 's collected matters just as much i know this is tough because methodologies can be opaque and actually kind of boring but there are some simple steps you can take to check this 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 561.43 563.88 <NA> i 'll use one last example here 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 563.78 572.37 <NA> one poll found that forty one percent of muslims in this country support jihad <unk> which is obviously pretty scary and it was reported everywhere in two thousand and fifteen
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 571.88 579.97 <NA> when i want to check a number like that i 'll start off by finding the original questionnaire <unk> it turns out that journalists who reported on that statistic
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 580.19 587.14 <NA> ignored a question lower down on the survey that asked respondents how they defined jihad and most of them defined it as 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 586.65 595.24 <NA> muslims ' personal <unk> peaceful struggle to be more religious only sixteen percent defined it as violent holy war against unbelievers 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 594.81 604.97 <NA> this is the really important important point <unk> based on those numbers it 's totally possible that no one in the survey who defined it as violent holy war also said they support it those two groups
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 604.99 606.71 <NA> <unk> might not overlap at all it
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 606.58 618.21 <NA> 's also worth asking how the survey was carried out this was something called an opt in poll which means anyone could have found it on the internet and completed it there 's no way of knowing if those people even identified as muslim <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 618.21 629.28 <NA> and finally there were six hundred respondents in that poll there are roughly three million muslims in this country according to pew research center that means the poll spoke to roughly one in every five thousand muslims in this country
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 629.93 643.44 <NA> <unk> the reasons why government statistics are often better than private statistics a poll might speak to a couple hundred people <unk> maybe a thousand or if you 're l 'oreal trying to sell skin care products in two thousand and five then you spoke to forty eight women to claim that they work 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 643.43 649.99 <NA> laughter private companies don 't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right they just need the right numbers government
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 650.7 658.61 <NA> <unk> aren 't like that in theory at least they 're totally impartial not least because most of them do their jobs regardless of who 's in power they 're civil servants <unk> 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 658.43 663 <NA> and to do their jobs properly they don 't just speak to a couple hundred people 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 663.01 672.46 <NA> those unemployment numbers i keep on referencing come from the bureau of labor statistics and to make their estimates they speak to over one hundred and forty thousand businesses in this country
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 671.97 679.97 <NA> i get it it 's frustrating if you want to test a statistic that comes from a private company you can buy the face cream for you and a bunch of friends test it out if it doesn 't work
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 679.96 690.89 <NA> <unk> you can say the numbers were wrong but how do you question government statistics you just keep checking everything find out how they collected the numbers find out if you 're seeing everything on the chart you need to see 
MonaChalabi_2017S 1 MonaChalabi_2017S 690.88 699.81 <NA> but don 't give up on the numbers altogether because if you do we 'll be making public policy decisions in the dark using nothing but private interests to guide us thank you
