TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 13.21 20.39 <NA> <unk> have a big announcement to make today <unk> and i 'm really excited about this <unk> and this may be a little bit of a surprise to
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 19.93 28.08 <NA> many of you who know my research and what i 've done well <unk> i 've really tried to solve some some big problems
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 30.11 38.13 <NA> <unk> terrorism and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer <unk> but i started thinking about all these problems <unk> and
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 38.27 47.34 <NA> i realized that the really biggest problem we face what all these other problems come down to is energy is electricity the flow of electrons <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 47.34 49.54 <NA> and i decided that
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 49.33 52.57 <NA> i was going to set out to try to to solve this
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 55.58 65.53 <NA> probably is not what you 're expecting you 're probably expecting me to come up here and talk about fusion because that 's what i 've done most of my life <unk> but this is actually a talk about
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 65.1 66.7 <NA> <unk> okay 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 68.37 74.87 <NA> but this is actually a talk about fission it 's about perfecting something old and bringing something old into the
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 76.27 78.38 <NA> <unk> let 's talk a little bit about
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 78.07 80.72 <NA> how nuclear fission works 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 80.26 86.46 <NA> in a nuclear power plant you have a big pot of water that 's under high pressure and you have some fuel rods 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 86.46 92.16 <NA> and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium and they 're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 91.93 97.89 <NA> and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level <unk> and that reaction
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 97.7 99.99 <NA> heats up water the water turns to
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 100.97 110.13 <NA> <unk> steam turns the turbine <unk> and you produce electricity from it this is the same way we 've been producing electricity the steam turbine idea for one hundred years 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 110.13 119.13 <NA> and nuclear was a really big advancement in a way to heat the water but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 119.06 125.14 <NA> and i thought <unk> you know <unk> is this the best way to do it is fission kind of played
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 125.55 128.65 <NA> <unk> or is there something left to innovate here 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 128.22 136.78 <NA> and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world <unk> and
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 137.07 143.87 <NA> this is what it is this is a small modular reactor <unk> so it 's not as big as
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 143.87 149.81 <NA> the reactor you see in the diagram here this is between fifty and one hundred megawatts <unk> but that 's a ton of
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 150.49 152.12 <NA> <unk> that 's between 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 151.81 163.4 <NA> say at an average use that 's maybe twenty five thousand to one hundred thousand homes could run off that now the really interesting thing about these reactors is they 're built in a factory <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 163.4 168.21 <NA> so they 're modular reactors that are built essentially on an assembly line <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 168 172.17 <NA> and they 're trucked anywhere in the world you plop them down and they produce electricity <unk>
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 173.7 174.99 <NA> this region right here is the
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 175.76 182.76 <NA> <unk> and this is buried below ground which is really important for someone who 's done a lot of counterterrorism work <unk> i can 't
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 182.36 190.65 <NA> extol to you how great having something buried below the ground is for for proliferation and security concerns <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 190.65 192.75 <NA> and inside this reactor
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 192.26 195.81 <NA> is a molten salt <unk> so anybody who 's a fan of
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 195.5 199.23 <NA> thorium they 're going to be really excited about this 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 201.9 205.87 <NA> <unk> happen to be really good at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle <unk>
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 208.07 211.93 <NA> but i 'm not really concerned about the fuel you can run these off
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 211.62 215.14 <NA> they 're really hungry they really like
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 214.86 224.59 <NA> down blended weapons pits so that 's highly enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium that 's been down blended it 's made into a grade where it 's not usable for a nuclear weapon
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 224.34 229.97 <NA> but they love this stuff <unk> and we have a lot of it sitting around because this is
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 229.96 236.12 <NA> <unk> big problem you know in the cold war we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons <unk> and that was great and
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 235.72 249.3 <NA> we don 't need them anymore <unk> and what are we doing with all the the waste essentially what are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons well we 're securing them and it would be great if we could burn them eat them up and this reactor loves this stuff <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 249.3 254.31 <NA> so it 's a molten salt reactor it has a core <unk> and it has a heat exchanger
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 255.05 262.72 <NA> <unk> the hot salt the radioactive salt to a cold salt which isn which isn 't radioactive it 's still thermally hot but it 's not radioactive <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 262.72 268.14 <NA> and then that 's a heat exchanger to what makes this design really really interesting 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 268.04 277.98 <NA> and that 's a heat exchanger to a gas so going back to what i was saying before about all power being produced well <unk> other than photovoltaic being produced by this
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 277.97 279.97 <NA> boiling of steam and turning a turbine
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 279.75 280.75 <NA> <unk> turbine
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 280.47 291.01 <NA> <unk> that 's actually not that efficient and in fact in a nuclear power plant like this it 's only roughly thirty to thirty five percent efficient that 's how much thermal <unk>
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 290.91 300.02 <NA> <unk> energy the reactor 's putting out to how much electricity it 's producing <unk> and the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature they operate anywhere
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 301.69 304.31 <NA> <unk> two hundred to three hundred degrees celsius <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 304.09 314.12 <NA> and these reactors run at six hundred to seven hundred degrees celsius <unk> which means the higher the temperature you go to thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 313.66 319.83 <NA> and this reactor doesn 't use water it uses gas so supercritical co2 or helium <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 319.83 329.91 <NA> and that goes into a turbine <unk> and this is called the brayton cycle this is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity and this makes this almost fifty percent efficient between forty five and fifty percent
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 329.87 333.84 <NA> <unk> efficiency <unk> and i 'm really excited about this because
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 333.47 340 <NA> it 's a very compact core molten salt reactors are very compact by nature <unk> but what 's
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 339.76 352.3 <NA> what 's also great is you get a lot more electricity out for how much uranium you 're fissioning not to mention the fact that these burn up their burn up is much higher so for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor a lot more of it 's
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 352.3 353.32 <NA> being used
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 354.87 358.03 <NA> <unk> traditional nuclear power plant like this is
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 357.57 361.3 <NA> <unk> you 've got these these rods that are clad in zirconium <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 360.81 369.09 <NA> and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets well uranium dioxide 's a ceramic and ceramic doesn 't like releasing what 's inside of it <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 369.09 374.99 <NA> so you have what 's called the xenon pit and so some of these fission products love neutrons they love the neutrons that are going on and
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 375 378.98 <NA> <unk> helping this reaction take place and they eat them up <unk> which means
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 378.97 387.35 <NA> that combined with the fact that the cladding doesn 't last very long you can only run one of these reactors for roughly say eighteen months without
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 387.07 389.12 <NA> refueling it <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 388.72 393.87 <NA> so these reactors run for thirty years without refueling which is 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 393.87 399.62 <NA> in my opinion very very amazing <unk> because it means it 's a sealed system no refueling means
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 400 403.92 <NA> can seal them up and they 're not going to be a proliferation risk <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 403.46 410.25 <NA> and they 're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 410.36 411.85 <NA> but
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 411.66 425.08 <NA> let 's go back to safety because everybody after fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear and one of the things when i set out to design a power reactor was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe <unk> and i 'm really excited about this
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 426.93 428.56 <NA> <unk> essentially two reasons 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 428.4 431.36 <NA> one it doesn 't operate at high pressure <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 431.15 438.45 <NA> so traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor they 're very very hot water at very high pressures <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 438.46 445.16 <NA> and this means essentially in the event of an accident if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 444.71 451.61 <NA> pressure vessel the coolant would leave the core these reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 451.61 454.97 <NA> so there 's no inclination for the fission
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 454.93 458.15 <NA> <unk> products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 457.81 463.59 <NA> also they operate at high temperatures <unk> and the fuel is molten <unk> so they can 't melt down <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 463.59 468.11 <NA> but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 467.74 474.9 <NA> or you lost off site power in the case of something like fukushima there 's a dump tank because your fuel is
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 475.67 478.2 <NA> <unk> and it 's combined with your coolant 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 477.97 480.57 <NA> you could actually just drain the core into
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 480.37 487.93 <NA> what 's called a sub critical setting <unk> basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers <unk> and this is really important <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 487.75 498.06 <NA> because the reaction stops in this kind of reactor you can 't do that the fuel like i said is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods <unk> and in the event of an accident in one of <unk>
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 497.96 504.64 <NA> <unk> these type of reactors fukushima and three mile island looking back at three mile island we didn 't really see this for a while
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 505.1 513.37 <NA> these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods what happens is when they see high pressure water steam in an oxidizing environment they
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 513.37 524.9 <NA> 'll actually produce hydrogen and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products so the core of this reactor since it 's not under pressure and it doesn 't have this chemical reactivity 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 524.69 528.4 <NA> means that there 's no inclination for the fission products
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 528.39 529.97 <NA> to leave this reactor
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 530.01 532.61 <NA> so even in the event of an accident
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 532.48 535.89 <NA> <unk> yeah <unk> the reactor may be toast which is you
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 535.89 543.44 <NA> know sorry for the power company <unk> but we 're not going to contaminate large quantities of land so i i really think that in the 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 543.01 549.93 <NA> say twenty years it 's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality this could be the source of
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 556.55 561.81 <NA> <unk> it 's an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 561.32 570.15 <NA> but it 's an innovation it 's a way to bring power to the developing world because it 's produced in a factory and it 's cheap you can put them anywhere in the world you want to 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 570.44 574.93 <NA> and maybe something else <unk> as a kid <unk> i was
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 576.27 578.92 <NA> <unk> was obsessed with nuclear science too to a point but
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 578.92 588.01 <NA> before that i was obsessed with space <unk> and i was really excited about you know being an astronaut and designing rockets which was something that was always exciting to me <unk> but
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 587.94 593.93 <NA> i think i get to come back to this because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 593.93 599.87 <NA> that produces fifty to one hundred megawatts <unk> that is the rocket designer 's dream <unk>
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 600.16 607.94 <NA> <unk> that 's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet 's dream not only do you have fifty to one hundred megawatts to power whatever you want to
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 607.48 613.58 <NA> provide propulsion to get you there <unk> but you have power once you get there you know rocket designers
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 613.39 624.72 <NA> who use solar panels or fuel cells <unk> i mean a few watts or kilowatts wow that 's a lot of power i mean now we 're talking about one hundred megawatts that 's a ton of power that could power power a martian
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 625.58 629.52 <NA> <unk> that could power a rocket there <unk> and so i hope that
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 629.39 637.5 <NA> maybe i 'll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that i explore my nuclear passion and
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 637.34 642.45 <NA> people say oh well you 've launched this thing and it 's radioactive into space and what about accidents 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 641.99 648.18 <NA> but we launch plutonium batteries all the time everybody was really excited about curiosity and that had
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 647.69 650.08 <NA> this big plutonium battery on board
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 651.81 658.6 <NA> <unk> which actually has a higher specific activity than the low enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 658.11 667.12 <NA> which means that the effects would be negligible <unk> because you launch it cold and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor so i
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 666.81 672.34 <NA> 'm really excited i think that i 've designed this reactor here that can
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 671.91 679.97 <NA> be an innovative source of energy provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications <unk> and i 'm really prepared

TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 687.7 700.02 <NA> i graduated high school in may and i decided that i was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that i 've developed these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 701.45 708.08 <NA> <unk> i want to do this <unk> and i 've slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people i 've ever had the chance to work with <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 707.92 718.23 <NA> and i 'm really prepared to make this a reality and i think i think that looking at the technology this will be cheaper than cheaper than or the same price <unk>
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 718.13 723.61 <NA> <unk> as natural gas <unk> and you don 't have to refuel it for thirty years which is an advantage for the developing world <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 729.96 735.15 <NA> <unk> something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 734.93 748.9 <NA> because the stars are giant fusion reactors they 're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky the energy that i 'm able to talk to you today <unk> while it was converted to chemical energy in my food originally came from a nuclear reaction 
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 748.9 753.23 <NA> and so there 's something poetic about in my opinion perfecting
TaylorWilson_2013 1 TaylorWilson_2013 754.87 759.81 <NA> <unk> and using it as a future source of innovative energy <unk> so thank you guys
