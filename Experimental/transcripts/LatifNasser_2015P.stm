LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 185.78 187.15 <NA> we took

LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 201.33 207.52 <NA> <unk> it was a smell that natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 207.45 219.64 <NA> collagen collagen is what gives structure to our bones and usually after so many years it breaks down but in this case the arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 219.72 225.02 <NA> then a year or two later natalia was at a conference in bristol and she saw that
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 233.29 243.54 <NA> <unk> turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone you can compare it to those of known species and 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 243.54 246.05 <NA> who knows <unk> maybe you get a match <unk> 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 246.04 247.95 <NA> so she
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 247.76 249.33 <NA> shipped him one of the fragments
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 256.25 258.64 <NA> <unk> and he processed it and compared it to

LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 279.09 287.57 <NA> <unk> and i 'm thinking what that 's amazing if it 's true ln so they tested a bunch of the fragments and they got the same result for each one
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 305.2 310.76 <NA> <unk> yeah natalia had found a giant arctic camel 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 313.96 321.44 <NA> now <unk> when you hear the word camel what may come to mind is one of these

LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 384.34 392.66 <NA> if i put them all in a lineup would they look different nr yeah you 're going to have different body sizes you 'll have some with really long necks so they 're actually
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 392.26 399.9 <NA> functionally like giraffes ln some had snouts like crocodiles nr the really primitive early
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 416.6 429.85 <NA> <unk> and then about three to seven million years ago one branch of camels went down to south america where they became llamas and alpacas and another branch crossed over the bering land bridge into asia and africa <unk> and then

LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 435.39 436.57 <NA> so 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 436.57 449.47 <NA> scientists knew all of that already <unk> but it still doesn 't fully explain how natalia found one so far north like this is temperature wise the polar opposite of the sahara
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 449.07 454.43 <NA> <unk> now to be fair three and a half million years ago it was on average

LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 458.64 460.95 <NA> boreal forest so
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 460.74 465.53 <NA> more like the yukon or siberia today but still 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 465.31 475.89 <NA> like they would have six month long winters where the ponds would freeze over you 'd have blizzards you 'd have twenty four hours a day of straight darkness
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 479.84 486.69 <NA> <unk> it that one of these saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions

LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 491.71 497.82 <NA> think they have an answer and it 's kind of brilliant what if
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 497.57 504.7 <NA> the very features that we imagine make the camel so well suited to places like the sahara
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 504.81 508.93 <NA> actually evolved to help it get through the winter 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 508.92 517.36 <NA> what if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand but over snow like a pair of snowshoes 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 517.29 523.39 <NA> what if that hump which huge news to me <unk> does not contain water it contains fat 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 524.16 529.85 <NA> was there to help the camel get through that <unk> six month long winter when food was scarce

LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 533.34 547.34 <NA> did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment like for instance the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place like a you know fat backpack 
LatifNasser_2015P 1 LatifNasser_2015P 547 553.86 <NA> means that you don 't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body <unk> so it helps heat dissipate easier
