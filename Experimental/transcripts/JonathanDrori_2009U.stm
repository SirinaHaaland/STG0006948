JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 14.44 20.33 <NA> <unk> all life depends on plants <unk> let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 21.43 24.84 <NA> just think for a moment it doesn 't matter whether you live in a small
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 25.91 30.51 <NA> <unk> or you live in a big city <unk> everything comes back to plants in the end 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 30.17 35.42 <NA> whether it 's for the food the medicine the fuel the construction the clothing all the obvious things <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 35.43 40.11 <NA> or whether it 's for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 40.1 48.69 <NA> or whether it 's soil formation <unk> or the effect on the atmosphere <unk> or primary production <unk> damn it even the books here are made out of plants <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 48.89 54.22 <NA> all these things they come back to plants <unk> and without them we wouldn 't be here
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 55.29 63.4 <NA> <unk> now plants are under threat they 're under threat because of changing climate <unk> and they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 63.03 68.02 <NA> and people like us want to do things that destroy plants and their habitats <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 67.74 74.99 <NA> and whether that 's because of food production <unk> or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn 't be
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 76.12 85.52 <NA> <unk> or because of habitats being used for other purposes all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt <unk> or die <unk> or move 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 85.33 90.74 <NA> and plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 90.82 100.05 <NA> so if all human life depends on plants <unk> doesn 't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them i think it does <unk> and i want to tell you about a project to
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 101.21 103.44 <NA> <unk> and the way that you save plants
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 103.01 105.51 <NA> is by storing seeds 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 105.17 114.94 <NA> because seeds in all their diverse glory are plants ' futures all the genetic information for future generations of plants
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 114.75 119.31 <NA> are held in seeds <unk> so here is the building <unk> it looks
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 119 129.4 <NA> rather unassuming really but it goes down below ground many stories and it 's the largest seed bank in the world <unk> it exists not only in southern england but distributed around the world
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 130.05 135.73 <NA> <unk> to that this is a nuclear proof facility <unk> god forbid that it should have to withstand that 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 135.66 139.99 <NA> so if you 're going to build a seed bank you have to decide what you 're going to store in it right <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 139.5 146.98 <NA> and we decided that what we want to store first of all are the species that are most under threat <unk> and those are the dry land species 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 147.09 150.58 <NA> so first of all we did deals
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 150.09 154.97 <NA> with fifty different countries it means negotiating with heads of state
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 155.25 163.61 <NA> and with secretaries of state in fifty countries to sign treaties we have one hundred and twenty partner institutions all over the world in all those countries colored orange 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 163.24 173.81 <NA> people come from all over the world to learn <unk> and then they go away and plan exactly how they 're going to collect these seeds they have thousands of people all over the world tagging <unk>
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 173.71 179.94 <NA> <unk> places where those plants are said to exist they search for them they find them in flower <unk> and they go back when their
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 180.01 184.89 <NA> seeds have arrived <unk> and they collect the seeds all over the world 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 185.06 191.29 <NA> the seeds some of if is very untechnical you kind of shovel them all in to bags and
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 191.11 200.41 <NA> dry them off you label them you do some high tech things here and there some low tech things here and there and the main thing is that you have to dry them
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 200.22 204.97 <NA> very carefully at low temperature <unk> and then you have to store them
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 204.81 214.85 <NA> <unk> them at about minus twenty degrees c that 's about minus four fahrenheit i think with a very critically low moisture content and these seeds will be
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 214.61 221.11 <NA> able to germinate we believe with many of the species in thousands of years
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 221.07 230 <NA> <unk> and certainly in hundreds of years it 's no good storing the seeds if you don 't know they 're still viable so every ten years we do germination tests
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 230.19 233.03 <NA> on every sample of seeds that we have 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 232.87 237.92 <NA> and this is a distributed network so all around the world people are doing the same thing <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 237.76 248.48 <NA> and that enables us to develop germination protocols that means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 248.71 249.84 <NA> and that is very
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 251.42 263.34 <NA> <unk> and then we grow these things <unk> and we tell people back in the countries where these seeds have come from look <unk> actually we 're not just storing this to get the seeds later <unk> but we can give you this information about how to
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 263.14 268.56 <NA> germinate these difficult plants and that 's already happening so where have we got to i
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 268.16 275.07 <NA> am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed that 's three thousand millionth seed

JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 290.36 297.59 <NA> these are not not just crop plants as you might have seen stored in svalbard in norway fantastic work there this is
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 297.4 303.56 <NA> at least one hundred times bigger we have thousands of collections that have been sent out
JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 303.32 304.55 <NA> all over the world

JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 325.52 333.81 <NA> <unk> like the tall grass prairie here in the usa <unk> or in mined land in various countries restoration is already happening because of these species

JonathanDrori_2009U 1 JonathanDrori_2009U 336.14 346.65 <NA> some of these plants like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen they are down to the last few remaining members the one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck
