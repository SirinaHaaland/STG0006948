MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 834.06 840.24 <NA> are actually only seventeen different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the alhambra <unk> 
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 840.24 847.34 <NA> and they if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one <unk> it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these seventeen 
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 847.57 854.97 <NA> but these are things that we can see and the power of galois ' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 855.17 857.31 <NA> in the unseen world beyond the <unk>
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 858.73 867.9 <NA> all the way through to the four or five or infinite dimensional space <unk> and that 's where i work i create mathematical objects symmetrical objects using galois ' language 
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 867.9 874.81 <NA> in very high dimensional spaces so i think it 's a great example of things unseen which the power of mathematical language allows you to
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 876.3 886.48 <NA> <unk> like galois i stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you and i 've got a picture of it here <unk> well <unk> unfortunately it isn 't really a picture if i could have my <unk>
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 886.38 897.79 <NA> <unk> board at the side here <unk> great excellent here we are unfortunately i can 't show you a a picture of this symmetrical object <unk> but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact 
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 904.93 914.7 <NA> craters on the moon or new species of animals <unk> so i 'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn 't been named before and this thing
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 914.65 925.17 <NA> <unk> species die away and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode but this mathematical object will live forever <unk> it will make you immortal in order to win this symmetrical
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 925.85 932.04 <NA> <unk> what you have to do is to answer the question i asked you at the beginning how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 932.39 939.87 <NA> <unk> okay i 'm going to sort you out rather than you all shouting out i want you to count how many digits there are in that number <unk> okay <unk> 
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 939.64 947.67 <NA> if you 've got it as a factorial you 've got to expand the factorials <unk> okay <unk> now if you want to play <unk> i want you to stand up <unk> okay if you think
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 947.67 951.96 <NA> you 've got an estimate for how many digits right we 've already got one competitor here
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 951.47 954.28 <NA> if you all stay down he wins it automatically
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 954.95 960.37 <NA> excellent so we 've got four here <unk> five six great excellent that should get us going all right 
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 961.53 968.56 <NA> anybody with five or less digits you 've got to sit down because you 've underestimated <unk> five or less digits <unk>
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 969.62 975.44 <NA> tens of thousands you 've got to sit down <unk> sixty digits or more you 've got to sit down you 've overestimated
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 982 986.79 <NA> <unk> how many digits are there in your number two so you should have sat down earlier
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 988.21 994.58 <NA> the other ones who sat sat down during the twenty up again okay <unk> if i told you twenty or less stand up because
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 994.12 999.93 <NA> this one i think there were a few here the people who just last sat down <unk> okay how many
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1007.54 1009.44 <NA> <unk> okay good how many do you have in yours 
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1009.31 1020.18 <NA> eighteen so it goes to this lady here twenty one is the closest it actually has the number of symmetries in the rubik 's cube has twenty five digits so now i need to name this object 
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1020.18 1021.83 <NA> so what is your name
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1021.4 1024.96 <NA> <unk> i need your surname symmetrical objects generally
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1038.18 1041.2 <NA> <unk> there we go that 's your new symmetrical object you are now immortal
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1074.85 1079.58 <NA> <unk> in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting
MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1 MarcusduSautoy_2009G 1079.96 1081.99 <NA> <unk> and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth
