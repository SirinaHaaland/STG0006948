JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 29.99 38.64 <NA> <unk> who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard and they 're questions that i 've asked of science television producers of audiences of

JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 40.48 42.1 <NA> that 's science teachers

JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 186.37 197.07 <NA> and some people probably two of you will come up and argue with me afterwards and say that actually it comes out of the ground now if that was true we 'd have trucks going round the country filling people 's gardens in with soil it 'd be a fantastic <unk>
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 196.97 204.7 <NA> <unk> business <unk> but actually we don 't do that the mass of this comes out of the air <unk> now i passed all my biology exams in

JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 287.82 297.68 <NA> the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people we might as well get it right and there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 297.44 299.9 <NA> what it is that 's happening in photosynthesis for

JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 303.31 312.18 <NA> and the other half of the carbon equation as i 'm very conscious as a trustee of kew is how much things soak up and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere

JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 330.56 338.52 <NA> of course you all knew that but if you haven 't played with a battery and a bulb <unk> if you 've only seen a circuit diagram you might not be able to do that <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 338.33 340.44 <NA> and that 's one of the problems 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 340.4 346.59 <NA> so why is it hotter in summer than in winter we learn as children that you get closer to something that 's hot <unk> and it burns you it
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 346.59 349.77 <NA> 's a very powerful bit of learning and it happens pretty early on 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 350.4 358.3 <NA> <unk> by extension we think to ourselves why it 's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we 're closer to the sun i promise you that most of you will have got that oh
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 357.96 363.1 <NA> you 're all shaking your heads but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly other ones are kind of going like this all right it
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 363.75 368.71 <NA> 's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the sun are spread out more 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 368.22 375.11 <NA> right <unk> because of the tilt of the earth and if you think the tilt is tilting us closer no it isn 't the sun is
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 375.58 381.02 <NA> <unk> million miles away and we 're tilting like this right it makes no odds in fact in the northern hemisphere <unk>
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 382.44 386.81 <NA> we 're further from the sun in summer as it happens but it makes no odds the difference 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 386.98 396.92 <NA> ok now <unk> the scribble of the diagram of the solar system if you believe as most of you probably do that it 's hotter in summer than in winter because we 're closer to the sun you must have drawn an ellipse 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 396.85 404.31 <NA> right that would explain it right <unk> except in your you 're nodding now in your ellipse have you thought well what happens during the night
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 405.05 408.51 <NA> <unk> australia and here <unk> right <unk> they 've got
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 408.17 415.44 <NA> summer and we 've got winter and what does the does the earth kind of rush towards the sun at night <unk> and then rush back again i mean it 's a
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 414.95 420.69 <NA> very strange thing going on <unk> and we hold these two models in our head of what 's right and what isn 't right
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 421.01 424.59 <NA> <unk> and we do that as human beings in all sorts of fields <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 426.57 433.61 <NA> <unk> here 's copernicus ' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan that 's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper right and
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 433.4 439.69 <NA> this is nasa 's view they 're stunningly similar <unk> i hope you notice the coincidence here 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 439.2 448.33 <NA> what would you do if you knew that people had this misconception right in their heads of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 447.84 450.02 <NA> what sort of diagram would you show them
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 450.04 458.13 <NA> <unk> the solar system to show that it 's not really like that you 'd show them something like this wouldn 't you it 's a plan looking down from above but no look what i found in the textbooks <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 457.89 465.15 <NA> that 's what you show people right <unk> these are from textbooks from websites educational websites and almost anything you pick up is like that 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 465.15 472.82 <NA> and the reason it 's like that is because it 's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles whereas that 's much more exciting to look at something at that angle isn 't it 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 472.6 477.12 <NA> right <unk> and by doing it at that angle if you 've got that misconception in your head then that
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 479.9 483.3 <NA> <unk> thing will be ellipses <unk> so you 've it
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 483.29 485.79 <NA> 's crap isn 't it really as we say 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 485.75 497.29 <NA> so these mental models we look for evidence that reinforces our models we do this of course with matters of race and politics and everything else and we do it in science as well so we look just look and scientists do it constantly
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 497.06 504.01 <NA> we look for evidence that reinforces our models <unk> and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 504.96 516.52 <NA> <unk> being i 'm in the united states i 'll have a dig at the europeans these are examples of what i would say is bad practice in science teaching centers these pictures are from la villette in france and the welcome
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 516.27 524.98 <NA> wing of the science museum in london <unk> and if you look at the kind of the way these things are constructed there 's a lot of mediation by glass and it 's very blue and
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 525.39 528.5 <NA> kind of professional in that way that
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 529.93 534.53 <NA> <unk> allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in annie hall and said god that 's so professional and
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 534.49 543.5 <NA> that you don 't there 's no passion in it and it 's not hands on right and you know pun intended <unk> whereas good interpretation i 'll use an example from nearby
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 543.01 550.05 <NA> is san francisco exploratorium where all the things that that the demonstrations and so on are made out of everyday objects
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 550.04 553.9 <NA> <unk> that children can understand it 's very hands on and they can engage with and experiment with 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 553.9 561.78 <NA> and i know that if the graduates at mit and in the imperial college in london had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff and you know 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 561.5 564.85 <NA> been able to do it they would have learned
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 564.52 569.19 <NA> how how it actually works rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can 't do it 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 569.51 575.17 <NA> so good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 575.88 579.52 <NA> <unk> and things that where there isn 't an extra barrier of a piece of glass
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 579.15 583.48 <NA> or machined titanium and it all looks fantastic ok 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 583.11 592.24 <NA> and the exploratorium does that really really well and it 's amateur <unk> but amateur in the best sense in other words the root of the word being of love and passion 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 593.22 600.05 <NA> so children are not empty vessels <unk> ok <unk> so as monty python would have it this is a bit lord privy seal to say so but
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 600.61 605.9 <NA> <unk> children are not empty vessels they come with their own ideas and their own theories and unless you work with those
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 605.74 612.92 <NA> <unk> then you won 't be able to shift them right and i probably haven 't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates either <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 612.67 621.53 <NA> but this applies equally to matters of trying to sell new technology for example we are in britain we 're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology [ for television ] 
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 621.53 625.11 <NA> and it 's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 625.25 627.09 <NA> <unk> 's quite difficult to shift those
JonathanDrori_2007U 1 JonathanDrori_2007U 627.83 633.84 <NA> <unk> so we 're not empty vessels the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood
