DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 12.64 21.89 <NA> <unk> as a magician i try to create images that make people stop and think <unk> i also try to challenge myself to do things that
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 21.4 29.97 <NA> doctors say are not possible <unk> i was buried alive in new york city in a coffin buried alive
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 29.93 31.86 <NA> <unk> in a coffin in april <unk>
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 32.96 34.41 <NA> <unk> for a week 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 34.07 43.66 <NA> i lived there with nothing but water <unk> and it ended up being so much fun that i decided i could pursue
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 43.3 51.66 <NA> doing more of these things the next one is i froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in new york city 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 51.17 54.52 <NA> that one was way more difficult than i had expected
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 55.38 67.93 <NA> the one after that i stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for thirty six hours <unk> i began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 67.59 70.51 <NA> so next i went to london 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 70.08 79.88 <NA> in london i lived in a glass box for forty four days with nothing but water it was for me one of the most difficult things i 'd ever done but it was
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 79.84 86.87 <NA> <unk> also the most beautiful there was so many skeptics <unk> especially the press in london that
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 87.01 92.48 <NA> they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 92.62 101.63 <NA> so i felt very validated when the new england journal of medicine actually used the research for science 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 101.89 104.94 <NA> my next pursuit was i wanted to see how
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 104.84 110.04 <NA> <unk> long i could go without breathing like how long i could survive with nothing not even air 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 109.82 114.99 <NA> i didn 't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 116.42 118.69 <NA> as a young magician <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 118.45 123.06 <NA> i was obsessed with houdini and his underwater challenges <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 123.06 129.94 <NA> so i began early on competing against the other kids <unk> seeing how long i could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 130.01 133.27 <NA> five times while i stayed under on one breath <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 132.93 138.41 <NA> by the time i was a teenager i was able to hold my breath for three minutes and thirty seconds <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 138.41 142.33 <NA> i would later find out that was houdini 's personal record in one
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 143.61 144.64 <NA> thousand nine <unk>
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 145.73 150.17 <NA> i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 150 154.07 <NA> ice and was trapped under a river he
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 153.67 157.97 <NA> was underneath not breathing for forty five minutes <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 157.97 167.96 <NA> when the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage his core temperature had dropped to seventy seven degrees 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 167.68 174.69 <NA> as a magician i think everything is possible <unk> and i think if something is done by one person it can be done by
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 175.73 179.19 <NA> <unk> i started to think if the boy could survive
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 178.7 183.21 <NA> without breathing for that long there must be a way that i could do it
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 182.96 191.41 <NA> so i met with a top neurosurgeon and i asked him how long is it possible to go without breathing like how long could i go without air 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 191.41 196.24 <NA> and he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 196.08 202.36 <NA> of hypoxic brain damage <unk> so i took that as a challenge basically
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 205.31 214.9 <NA> <unk> i figured that i could do something similar <unk> and i created a water tank <unk> and i filled it with ice
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 214.41 222.07 <NA> and freezing cold water <unk> and i stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 222.07 229.25 <NA> and i was shivering in my first attempt to hold my breath i couldn 't even last a minute <unk> so i realized that was completely not going to work
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 230.55 233.33 <NA> i went to talk to a doctor friend
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 235.15 238.88 <NA> and i asked him how could i <unk>
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 239.89 249 <NA> <unk> i want to hold my breath for a really long time how could it be done and he said david you 're a magician <unk> create the illusion of not breathing it will be much easier
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 253.01 261.3 <NA> <unk> he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather with a co2 scrubber <unk> which was basically
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 261.44 266.79 <NA> a tube from home depot with a balloon duct taped to it <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 266.79 272.29 <NA> that he thought we could put inside of me and somehow be able to
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 272.08 274.99 <NA> circulate the air and rebreathe with this
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 276.93 282.61 <NA> <unk> this is a little hard to watch but this is that attempt 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 288.15 291.1 <NA> so that clearly wasn 't going to work 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 294.36 304.97 <NA> then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing there is a chemical that 's called perflubron <unk> and it 's so high in oxygen levels that in theory
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 304.99 306.24 <NA> <unk> you could breathe it 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 306.06 316.4 <NA> so i got my hands on that chemical filled the sink up with it and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in which was really impossible it 's <unk>
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 316.3 323.49 <NA> <unk> basically like trying to breathe as a doctor said while having an elephant standing on your chest so that idea disappeared <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 325.61 329.83 <NA> <unk> would it be possible to hook up a heart lung bypass machine
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 329.65 336.93 <NA> and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 336.77 340.62 <NA> which was another insane idea obviously 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 340.97 348.33 <NA> then i thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas to actually do it 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 348.65 354.94 <NA> to actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 357.06 362.24 <NA> so <unk> i started researching into pearl divers you know
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 362.24 368.92 <NA> because they go down for four minutes on one breath and when i was researching pearl divers i found the world of free diving 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 368.85 370.85 <NA> it was the most
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 370.64 374.99 <NA> amazing thing that i ever discovered pretty much there is
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 377.56 386.99 <NA> <unk> there is depth records where people go as deep as they can and then there is static apnea that 's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 386.53 396.15 <NA> that was the one that i studied the first thing that i learned is when you 're holding your breath <unk> you should never move at all that wastes energy <unk> and that
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 395.96 400.02 <NA> depletes oxygen and it builds up co2 in your blood so i
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 400 409.85 <NA> <unk> learned never to move and i learned how to slow my heart rate down <unk> i had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that i wasn 't in my body and just control that 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 409.86 415.89 <NA> and then i learned how to purge <unk> purging is basically hyperventilating you blow in and out breathing
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 419.42 424.93 <NA> you do that you get lightheaded you get tingling <unk> and you 're really ridding your body of
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 425.85 431.92 <NA> <unk> when you hold your breath it 's infinitely easier then i learned that you have to take a huge breath and
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 432.81 439.87 <NA> just hold and relax and never let any air out and just hold and relax through all the pain 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 439.59 447.65 <NA> every morning <unk> this is for months i would wake up and the first thing that i would do is i would hold my breath
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 447.47 448.55 <NA> for
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 450 460.28 <NA> i would hold my breath for forty four minutes <unk> so basically what that means is i would purge i 'd breathe really hard for a minute <unk> and i would hold immediately after for five and a half minutes <unk>
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 460.23 470.79 <NA> <unk> then i would breathe again for a minute <unk> purging as hard as i can then immediately after that i would hold again for five and a half minutes i would repeat this process eight times in a row 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 479.69 480.84 <NA> <unk> headaches 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 480.44 484.67 <NA> basically i 'm not the best person to talk to when i 'm doing that stuff 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 484.51 496.83 <NA> i started learning about the world record holder his name is tom sietas <unk> and this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath <unk> he 's six foot four he 's one hundred and sixty pounds 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 496.83 499.87 <NA> and his total lung capacity is twice the
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 509.07 516.13 <NA> <unk> i had to drop fifty pounds in three months <unk> so everything that i put into my body i considered
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 516.13 524.78 <NA> as medicine every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value <unk> i ate really small controlled portions throughout the
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 535.06 541.71 <NA> <unk> the thinner i was the longer i was able to hold my breath <unk> and by eating so well and training so hard 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 541.71 548.12 <NA> my resting heart rate dropped to thirty eight beats per minute <unk> which is lower than most olympic athletes 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 548.5 550.02 <NA> in four months of
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 550.43 553.83 <NA> <unk> i was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 553.79 564.09 <NA> i wanted to try holding my breath everywhere i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 566.87 574.96 <NA> i decided that i was going to break the world record live on prime time television the world record was eight minutes and
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 576.99 585.61 <NA> <unk> guy with the whale lungs i told you about i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center and
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 585.12 596.38 <NA> if i stayed there a week not eating i would get comfortable in that situation and i would slow my metabolism which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 596.16 604.97 <NA> i was completely wrong i entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date <unk> and i thought everything
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 604.9 614.42 <NA> <unk> seemed to be on track <unk> two days before my big breath hold attempt for the record <unk> the producers of my television special thought that
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 613.99 621.02 <NA> just watching somebody holding their breath <unk> and almost drowning is too boring for television 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 622.72 625.47 <NA> laughter so i had to add handcuffs
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 625.49 630.78 <NA> <unk> while holding my breath to escape from this was a critical mistake 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 630.8 639.9 <NA> because of the movement <unk> i was wasting oxygen <unk> and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 640.34 645.42 <NA> by seven eight i started to black out 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 645.5 651.85 <NA> and by seven minutes and thirty seconds <unk> they had to pull my body out and bring me back
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 656.97 659.41 <NA> <unk> i had failed on every level 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 660.72 666.37 <NA> so <unk> naturally <unk> the only way out of the slump that i could think of
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 666.06 671.38 <NA> was i decided to call oprah 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 672.57 679.94 <NA> i told her that i wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had this was a different
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 679.9 687.2 <NA> <unk> record this was a pure <unk> o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at thirteen minutes
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 687.85 696.23 <NA> so basically you breathe pure <unk> o2 first oxygenating your body flushing out co2 and you are able to hold much longer 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 697 699.6 <NA> i realized that my real
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 711.02 714.39 <NA> <unk> oprah gave me four months to prepare and train <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 713.99 724.41 <NA> so i would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night a hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at fifteen thousand feet so it 's like base camp everest 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 723.98 729.88 <NA> what that does is you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 730.02 732.67 <NA> <unk> helps you carry oxygen better 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 734.01 743.44 <NA> every morning again after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out my first attempt on pure o2 i was able to go up to fifteen <unk>
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 743.34 752.54 <NA> <unk> minutes <unk> so it was a pretty big success <unk> the neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind at fifteen minutes your brain is done
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 755.02 762.27 <NA> <unk> up and i was fine there was one person there that was definitely not impressed it was my
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 763.29 770.48 <NA> while i was breaking the record underwater for the first time she was sifting through my blackberry checking all my messages

DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 780.38 786.03 <NA> <unk> i then announced that i was going to go for sietas ' record <unk> publicly <unk> and
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 785.6 789.93 <NA> what he did in response is he went on regis and kelly 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 789.5 792.13 <NA> and broke his old record 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 792.13 799.99 <NA> then his main competitor went out and broke his record so he suddenly pushed the record up to sixteen minutes and thirty two
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 800.88 805.66 <NA> <unk> which was three minutes longer than i had prepared it was longer than the record
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 807.69 814.7 <NA> i wanted to get the science times to document this i wanted to get them to do a piece on it <unk> so <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 814.7 820.79 <NA> i did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 820.55 824.54 <NA> i walked into the new york times offices and did card tricks to everybody 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 829.12 843.14 <NA> <unk> i don 't know if it was the magic or the lure of the cayman islands but john tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath holding while he was there i tried to impress him of course and i did a dive down to one hundred and sixty feet which is
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 842.98 850.11 <NA> basically the height of a sixteen story building and as i was coming up i blacked out underwater which is really dangerous
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 851.93 858.19 <NA> <unk> kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up <unk> so <unk> i started full focus
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 857.95 867.99 <NA> i completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what i needed to do but there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it being on oprah <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 867.71 869.05 <NA> but
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 868.72 878.79 <NA> in practice i would do it face down floating on the pool but for tv they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face basically 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 878.6 879.97 <NA> the other problem
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 880.11 881.16 <NA> <unk> was
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 880.83 887.76 <NA> the the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up so i had to use my legs
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 887.6 892.45 <NA> to hold my feet into the straps that were loose which was a real problem for me 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 892.59 897.04 <NA> that made me extremely nervous <unk> raising the heart rate 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 897.03 904.79 <NA> then what they also did was which we never did before is there was a heart rate monitor <unk> and it was right next to the sphere
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 905.13 906.44 <NA> every time my heart would <unk>
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 908.1 916.07 <NA> the ticking really loud <unk> which was making me more nervous and there was no way to slow my heart rate down 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 916.69 925.05 <NA> normally i would start at thirty eight beats per minute <unk> and while holding my breath it would drop to twelve beats per minute <unk> which is pretty
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 932.42 937.77 <NA> <unk> this time it started at one hundred and twenty beats <unk> and it never went down <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 937.82 943.68 <NA> i spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down <unk> 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 943.68 953.8 <NA> i was just sitting there thinking i 've got to slow this down i 'm going to fail and i was getting more nervous and the heart rate just kept going up and up all the way up to one hundred and fifty beats
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 956.55 962.53 <NA> <unk> basically it 's the same thing that created my downfall at lincoln center it was a waste of o2 
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 962.19 971.62 <NA> when i made it to the halfway mark at eight minutes i was one hundred percent certain that i was not going to be able to make this there was no way for me to do it <unk>
DavidBlaine_2009P 1 DavidBlaine_2009P 972.96 979.91 <NA> i figured oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing if i had cracked early it would be a whole show
