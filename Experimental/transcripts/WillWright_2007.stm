WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 34.76 41.32 <NA> that 's not what i want to talk about today i want to talk about toys <unk> and the power that i see inherent in them 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 41.32 46.09 <NA> when i was a kid i attended montessori school up to sixth grade in atlanta georgia 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 45.88 53.38 <NA> and at the time i didn 't think much about it but then later i realized that that was the high point of my education from that point on everything else was pretty much downhill
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 54.93 63.28 <NA> <unk> and it wasn 't until later as i started making games that i really actually think of them more as toys people call me a game designer but i really think of these things more as toys <unk>
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 62.91 75.02 <NA> i started getting very interested in maria montessori and her methods and the way she went about things and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly and she would design these
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 75.37 82.52 <NA> <unk> where kids in playing with the toys would come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play and since they discovered this 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 82.52 89.64 <NA> it stuck with them so much more and also they would experience their own failures there was a failure based aspect to learning there it was very important <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 89.22 93.86 <NA> and so the games that i do i think of really more as modern montessori toys <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 93.86 99.9 <NA> and i really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 100.31 115 <NA> <unk> so a few years ago i started getting very interested in the seti program <unk> and that 's the way i work i get interested in different subjects i dive in research them and then try to figure out how to craft a toy around that so that other people can experience the same sense of discovery that i did as i was learning that subject 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 115 124.93 <NA> and it led me to astrobiology <unk> the study of possible life in the universe <unk> and then drake 's equation looking at the probability of life arising on planets how long it might last how many planets are out there
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 126.39 131.74 <NA> <unk> i started looking at how interesting drake 's equation was because it spanned all these different subjects

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 194.51 199.87 <NA> it helps to make it cute the players are going to play through every generation of this species

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 216.53 219.58 <NA> and then we start interacting with larger and larger organisms

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 230.74 236.22 <NA> <unk> at this point we 're leaving the water <unk> and one thing that 's kind of important about this game is that at every level 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 236.22 248.39 <NA> the player is designing their creature <unk> and that 's a fundamental aspect of this now in the evolution game here the creature scale basically you have to eat <unk> survive and then reproduce you know very darwinian 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 247.96 249.96 <NA> one thing we noticed with the sims 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 250.04 258.91 <NA> <unk> game i did earlier is that players love making stuff when they were able to make stuff in the game they had a lot of empathy in connection to it <unk> even if it wasn 't as pretty as

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 270.2 275.05 <NA> and now we might try to eat we might sneak up on this little guy over
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 296.07 298.82 <NA> <unk> play through every generation of this creature we
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 312.07 317.24 <NA> <unk> actual evolution with humans and all that because it 's almost more interesting to look at alternate
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 317.24 324.96 <NA> possibilities in evolution evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through <unk> but really it represents this huge set of possibilities <unk> now once we mate
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 325.34 328.6 <NA> <unk> click on the egg <unk> and this is where the game starts getting interesting because
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 328.42 333.15 <NA> one of the things we really focused on here was giving the players very high leverage tools <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 332.66 337.08 <NA> so that for very little effort the player can make something very cool 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 337.08 345.51 <NA> and it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side but basically this is the editor where we 're going to design the next generation <unk> so it has a little spine i can move around i
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 345.38 354.97 <NA> can extend i can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel so you sculpt it like clay we have parts here that i can put on or pull off the idea is that the player can basically design
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 354.96 363.19 <NA> <unk> anything they can think of in this editor and we 'll basically bring it to life so i might put some limbs on the character here i 'll inflate them kind of large <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 362.7 366.04 <NA> and in this case i might decide i 'm going to put i 'll

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 372.45 375.02 <NA> so pretty much players are encouraged to be very
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 377.29 384.83 <NA> <unk> give it one eye in the middle maybe scale it up a bit point it down <unk> and i 'll also give it a few legs <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 385.66 394.62 <NA> so in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player 's imagination <unk> so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 394.44 399.99 <NA> that they didn 't really think was possible before this is almost like designing something like maya that an eight year old can
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 400.64 409.92 <NA> <unk> but really the goal here was within about a minute i wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create ok now i 'll put some hands on it
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 409.73 416.04 <NA> ok <unk> so here i 've basically thrown together a little creature let me give it a little weapon on the tail here so it can fight <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 416.48 425.17 <NA> ok so that 's the complete model now we can actually go to the painting phase at this phase the program has some understanding of the topology of this creature it knows where the backbone
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 425.88 436.63 <NA> <unk> where the spine the limbs are how stripes should run how it should be shaded <unk> and so we 're procedurally generating the texture map something a texture artist would take many many days to work on and then we can test it out <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 436.26 438.37 <NA> and see how it would move around 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 438.03 444.92 <NA> and so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature <unk> it 's looking at whatever i 've designed it will actually bring it to life and i can see how it might dance

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 459.52 465.11 <NA> so then i bring this back into the game it 's born and i play the next generation of my creature through evolution 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 465.11 473.64 <NA> now again the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous when players create content in this game <unk> it 's automatically sent up to a server
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 473.46 479.85 <NA> and then redistributed to all the other players transparently so in fact as i 'm interacting in this world with other creatures
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 480.05 490.29 <NA> <unk> these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play so the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database of content <unk> and pretty much everything you 're going to see <unk>
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 490.19 495.67 <NA> <unk> in this game <unk> there 's an editor for that the player can create up through civilization this is
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 504.93 515.08 <NA> <unk> start dealing with tribes cities and civilizations of them over time i 'm going to skip way ahead to the space phase <unk> eventually they would go out into space and
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 514.71 521.03 <NA> start colonizing and exploring the universe <unk> now <unk> really in some sense i want the players to be
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 521.03 529.46 <NA> building this world in their imagination <unk> and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain so that 's kind of what these tools are about how do we make the gameplay
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 530.22 533.33 <NA> basically the player 's imagination amplifier 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 532.93 542.34 <NA> and how do we make these tools these editors something that are just as fun as the game itself <unk> so this is the planet that we 've been playing on up to this point in the game
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 542.62 549.8 <NA> so far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here at this point we 're actually dealing with a very little toy planet
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 550.52 558.48 <NA> <unk> like the montessori toy idea what happens if you give somebody a toy planet and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it <unk> what could they discover what might they learn on this 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 558.08 567.76 <NA> this world was actually extracted from the player 's imagination so this is the planet that the player evolved on things like the buildings the vehicles the architecture civilizations
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 567.58 574.87 <NA> were all designed by the player up to this point <unk> so here 's a little city with some of our guys walking around in it and most games put the player in the role
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 576.42 578.44 <NA> <unk> this protagonist playing through this story
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 577.98 590.02 <NA> this is more about putting the player in the role of george lucas i want them after they 've played this game to have extracted an entire world that they 're now interacting with as we pull down here we still have a whole set of creatures
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 589.8 603.01 <NA> living on the surface of the planet all these different dynamics going on here i can look over here and this is a little simplified food web that 's going on with the creatures i can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface you get some sense of the diversity of creatures
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 602.58 604.25 <NA> that were brought in
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 604.99 612.23 <NA> <unk> were created by the player others by other players automatically sent over here <unk> but there 's a very simple calculation of what 's required how many
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 611.8 618.09 <NA> plants are required for the herbivores to live how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat etc that you have to balance actively
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 618.09 629.67 <NA> also with this phase <unk> we 're getting more and more god like powers for the player and you can experiment with this planet as a toy <unk> so i can come in and i can do things and just treat this planet as a lump of clay we have very simple weather systems
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 629.92 633.64 <NA> simple geology for instance i could open one of my tools here
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 633.46 639.9 <NA> and then carve out rivers so this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay a sculpture <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 639.41 647.73 <NA> i can also play with the dynamics in this world over time <unk> so one of the things i can do is start pumping more co2 gases into the atmosphere <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 647.27 653.86 <NA> and so that 's what i 'm doing here there 's actually a little readout down there of our planetary atmosphere pressure and temperature
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 655.02 663.13 <NA> <unk> as i start pumping in more atmosphere we 're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you 'll start noticing we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 663.48 672.04 <NA> and our cities are going to be at risk too because a lot of these are coastal cities you can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities i 'll start losing cities here <unk> 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 672.81 678.53 <NA> so basically i want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space <unk> so there goes one city
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 680.5 687.32 <NA> <unk> now over time this is going to heat up the planet so at first what we 're going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet <unk> but then over time <unk> i can speed it up <unk>
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 688.69 695.61 <NA> <unk> see the heat impact of that as well not only will it get hotter but at some point it 's going to get so hot the oceans will evaporate
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 705.08 709.59 <NA> <unk> that actually brings up an interesting point about games now here our entire oceans are
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 709.4 718.62 <NA> evaporating off the surface and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet is going to melt down here it goes so we 're not only simulating

WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 723.25 729.28 <NA> and what 's interesting to me about games is that i think we can take a lot of long term dynamics and compress them into very
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 730.13 743.71 <NA> short term experiences <unk> because it 's so hard for people to think fifty or one hundred years out <unk> but when you can give them a toy and they can experience these long term dynamics in just a few minutes <unk> i think it 's an entirely different point of view where we 're actually <unk> using the game to remap our intuition 
WillWright_2007 1 WillWright_2007 743.51 752.89 <NA> it 's almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight i think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time <unk>
