DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 13.78 17.72 <NA> <unk> because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 17.72 24.87 <NA> how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be <unk> and i thought that since i was among friends here
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 25.46 33.72 <NA> <unk> i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 34.04 35.64 <NA> with these
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 35.54 37.65 <NA> amazing
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 37.31 47.01 <NA> jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can we can barely keep on top of it <unk> so i 'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 46.55 48.18 <NA> and then <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 47.87 49.99 <NA> so if you can just turn on the
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 53.46 57.71 <NA> <unk> this is just a random slide that i i picked out of my file <unk>
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 57.71 65.27 <NA> what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide but the general form of it this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 64.82 66.07 <NA> about
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 65.84 71.08 <NA> the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 70.8 79.97 <NA> and the interesting thing about it is that this slide like so many technology slides that we 're used to is a sort of a straight
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 80.05 82.73 <NA> <unk> line on a semi log curve <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 82.66 88.28 <NA> in other words every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 88.12 92.99 <NA> and this is a new thing that we talk about technology <unk>
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 94.21 99.96 <NA> something really weird is going on here <unk> and that 's basically what i 'm going to be talking about so if you could bring up the
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 105.2 108.42 <NA> <unk> bring up the lights higher because i 'm just going to use a piece of paper here
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 108.14 116.22 <NA> <unk> now why do we draw technology curves in semi log curves well the answer is if i drew it on a normal curve
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 115.82 123.45 <NA> where let 's say this is years this is time of some sort <unk> and this is whatever measure of the technology
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 123.14 124.78 <NA> that that i 'm trying to
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 127.2 131.05 <NA> <unk> the graphs look sort of silly <unk> they sort of go like this and
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 132.6 136.31 <NA> they don 't tell us much <unk> now
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 136.1 141.14 <NA> if i graph for instance <unk> some other technology say transportation technology 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 140.9 145 <NA> on a semi log curve it would look very stupid it would look like a flat line but
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 144.99 153.53 <NA> when something like this happens things are qualitatively changing <unk> so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 154.98 160.64 <NA> the day after tomorrow i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in thirty seconds 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 160.33 171.26 <NA> it 's not moving like that and there 's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 171.4 174.71 <NA> now the question that i 'd like to ask
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 175.04 183.77 <NA> <unk> if you look at these these exponential curves <unk> they don 't go on forever things just can 't possibly keep changing
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 183.61 191.58 <NA> as fast as they are one of two things is going to happen either it 's going to turn into a sort of classical <unk> <unk> s curve
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 191.48 198.93 <NA> like this <unk> until something totally different comes along or maybe it 's going to do this 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 201.21 206.14 <NA> <unk> now i 'm an optimist so i sort of think it 's probably going to do something like that 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 205.68 212.39 <NA> if so that means that what we 're in the middle of right now is a transition we 're sort of on this line
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 212.06 217.21 <NA> in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 217.23 224.93 <NA> and so what i 'm trying to ask what i 've been asking myself is what 's this new way that the world is what 's that new state that the world is
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 226.51 234.26 <NA> <unk> the transition seems very very confusing when we 're right in the middle of it now when i was a kid growing up 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 234.55 240.59 <NA> the future was kind of the year two thousand and people used to talk about what would happen in the year two thousand
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 241.15 249.75 <NA> <unk> now here 's a conference in which people talk about the future <unk> and you notice that the future is still at about the year two thousand it 's about as far as we go
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 250.67 255 <NA> <unk> so in other words the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 256.52 261.99 <NA> for my whole lifetime now i think that the reason
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 261.56 267.76 <NA> is because we all feel that something 's happening there that transition is happening we can all sense it 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 267.76 274.38 <NA> and we know that it just doesn 't make too much sense to think out thirty fifty years because everything 's going to be so different
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 273.95 275.02 <NA> that a simple
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 276.27 285.52 <NA> <unk> doing just doesn 't make any sense at all so what i would like to talk about is what that could be what that transition could be that we 're going through <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 286.05 293.71 <NA> now in order to do that i 'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 293.52 298.57 <NA> technology and computers because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 298.56 304.94 <NA> and take a long time scale look at things so the time scale that i would like to look at this on
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 305.11 308.75 <NA> <unk> the time scale of of life on earth so
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 310.06 311.35 <NA> i think this
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 311.19 315.53 <NA> this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 316.15 325.05 <NA> so if you go back about two and a half billion years <unk> the earth was this big sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 327.65 333.87 <NA> <unk> if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 334.04 341.31 <NA> and i think that there 's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna but i 'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 341.09 349.11 <NA> which is that at that time there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 349.22 354.04 <NA> and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 353.83 354.97 <NA> which caused them
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 354.9 359.2 <NA> <unk> to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 359.04 368.11 <NA> and those that were like that started to split and divide <unk> and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense those little drops of oil <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 368.04 375.08 <NA> but now those drops of oil weren 't really alive as we say it now because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 378.88 379.93 <NA> <unk> sort of
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 379.81 385.25 <NA> unequal division of the chemicals within them and so every drop was a little bit different 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 384.88 391.34 <NA> in fact the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 391.18 398.48 <NA> grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more <unk> so those tended to live longer get expressed more <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 398.92 400.35 <NA> now
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 400.11 401.57 <NA> that 's sort of
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 401.59 404.67 <NA> just a very simple chemical form of life
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 404.96 406.77 <NA> <unk> things got interesting
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 406.88 413.55 <NA> was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction <unk> somehow
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 413.55 422.85 <NA> by ways that we don 't quite understand these little drops learned to write down information they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 422.51 425.05 <NA> onto a particular kind of chemical
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 426.51 431.44 <NA> <unk> so in other words they worked out in this mindless sort of evolutionary way 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 431.44 437.83 <NA> a form of writing that let them write down what they were so that that way of writing it down could get copied <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 437.7 450.08 <NA> the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago <unk> in fact the recipe for us our genes is exactly that same code and that same way of writing <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 450.08 453.23 <NA> in fact every living creature is written
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 453.04 454.97 <NA> in exactly the same set of letters and
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 454.99 463.46 <NA> <unk> same code <unk> in fact one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code and i 've got here a little one
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 463.66 466.7 <NA> hundred micrograms of white powder
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 467.11 468.65 <NA> <unk> which i
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 468.4 474.96 <NA> try not to let the security people see at airports but this has in it
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 475 477.12 <NA> what i did is i took this code
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 476.78 483.54 <NA> the code has standard letters that that we use for symbolizing it <unk> and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 483.11 486.36 <NA> and amplified it ten to the twenty two times <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 486.05 494.89 <NA> so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card i have plenty for everyone in the room and in fact everyone in the world <unk> and it 's right here
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 505.05 508.6 <NA> <unk> i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 515.67 520.48 <NA> so what was the next step writing down the dna was an interesting step <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 520.38 529.88 <NA> and that caused these cells that kept them happy for another billion years <unk> but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different which is these
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 529.78 538.94 <NA> <unk> cells started exchanging and communicating information so that they began to get communities of cells <unk> i don 't know if you know this but bacteria can actually exchange dna now
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 538.69 545.13 <NA> that 's why for instance antibiotic resistance has evolved some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 545.13 549.21 <NA> and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 549 554.79 <NA> other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 555.32 560.19 <NA> now what this communication allowed was communities to form
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 559.76 563.52 <NA> that in some sense were in the same boat together they were synergistic 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 563.24 572.16 <NA> so they survived or they failed together which means that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 572.03 575.08 <NA> were repeated more and they were favored by
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 576.84 586.34 <NA> <unk> now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that in fact they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 586.16 588.52 <NA> on one string of dna 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 588.42 592.88 <NA> and so the next stage that 's interesting in life took about another billion years and
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 592.88 600.11 <NA> at that stage we have multi cellular communities communities of lots of different types of cells <unk> working together
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 604.12 605.39 <NA> <unk> lots of cells
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 605.19 611.3 <NA> that are not out for themselves anymore your skin cell is really useless without
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 611.13 614.63 <NA> a heart cell muscle cell a brain cell and so on 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 614.35 621.74 <NA> so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 621.74 624.41 <NA> but a community which we call an organism <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 625.12 627.93 <NA> now the next step that happened
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 627.72 629.64 <NA> is within these communities
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 629.96 639.6 <NA> <unk> communities of cells <unk> again began to abstract information and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 639.14 647.22 <NA> and those are the neural structures so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up and
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 646.91 651.58 <NA> in fact they began to get specialists in the community and special structures
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 651.42 653.59 <NA> that were responsible for recording
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 654.83 658.88 <NA> understanding learning information and that was the brains and the nervous system
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 658.64 665.2 <NA> of those communities <unk> and that gave them an evolutionary advantage because at that point 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 665.82 668.02 <NA> an individual
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 667.59 676.22 <NA> learning could happen within the time span of a single organism <unk> instead of over this evolutionary time span <unk> so
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 676.03 679.97 <NA> an organism could for instance learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 679.96 682.82 <NA> <unk> it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 682.45 690.15 <NA> it that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism <unk> whereas before they 'd built these special information processing structures 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 690.15 694.1 <NA> that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 693.61 703.32 <NA> hundreds of thousands of years by by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit <unk> so that nervous system the fact that they built these special information structures
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 704.87 712.29 <NA> <unk> up the whole process of evolution because evolution could now happen within an individual it could happen in learning time scales but
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 712.64 717.96 <NA> then what happened was the individuals worked out of course tricks of communicating <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 718.25 727.87 <NA> and for example the most sophisticated version that we 're aware of is human language it 's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it here i have a very
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 727.7 729.25 <NA> complicated messy
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 729.84 739.75 <NA> <unk> idea in my head i 'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically <unk> and hopefully constructing a similar messy confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 739.47 747.55 <NA> but we 're taking something very complicated turning it into sound <unk> sequences of sounds and producing something very complicated in your brain <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 747.63 749.23 <NA> so
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 748.92 754.1 <NA> this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 755.47 758.25 <NA> <unk> and so in fact <unk> what we 've done
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 758.04 766.18 <NA> is we humanity have started abstracting out we 're going through the same levels that multi cellular organisms have gone through
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 766.18 774.93 <NA> abstracting out our methods of recording <unk> presenting <unk> processing information <unk> so for example the invention of language was a tiny step in that
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 780.47 787.95 <NA> <unk> so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we 've now built within our society for handling that information <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 787.64 790.8 <NA> and it all connects us together
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 790.46 799.9 <NA> into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than than what we were before <unk>
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 800.37 809.08 <NA> <unk> so now evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds and you saw ty 's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 808.88 811.72 <NA> on the convolution program right before your eyes <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 811.49 818.29 <NA> so now we 've speeded up the time scales once again so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 818.28 825.08 <NA> and the next steps like nervous systems and brains took a few hundred million years <unk> then the next
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 825.34 833.12 <NA> <unk> like language and so on took less than a million years <unk> and these next steps like electronics seem to be taking only a few decades
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 832.95 836.42 <NA> the process is feeding on itself and becoming
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 835.93 844.34 <NA> <unk> i guess <unk> autocatalytic is the word for it when something reinforces its rate of change the more it changes the faster it changes and
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 843.91 849.72 <NA> i think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve we 're seeing this process feeding back on itself <unk>

DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 860.28 867.69 <NA> without recent advances in computers so right now what i do is i design objects at such complexity
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 867.35 875.26 <NA> that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense i don 't know what every transistor in the connection machine does <unk> there are billions
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 877.53 886.9 <NA> <unk> i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 886.67 895.63 <NA> beyond what we could ever do much farther and faster than we could ever do <unk> and in fact sometimes it takes it by methods that we don 't quite even understand 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 895.59 897.44 <NA> one method
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 897.21 904.97 <NA> that 's particularly interesting that that i 've been using a lot lately is evolution itself <unk> so what we do is we put
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 905.07 907.58 <NA> inside the machine
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 907.09 911.78 <NA> a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 911.5 917.78 <NA> so for example in the most extreme cases <unk> we can actually evolve a program
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 917.41 924.99 <NA> by starting out with random sequences of instructions <unk> say computer would you please make a hundred million random sequences of
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 926.39 934.41 <NA> <unk> now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions run all of those programs and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 934.52 939.78 <NA> so in other words i define what i wanted let 's say i want to sort numbers as a simple example i 've done it with 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 939.71 943.89 <NA> so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 943.52 952.32 <NA> so of course random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers <unk> so none of them will really do it but one of them by luck may
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 951.86 954.07 <NA> put two numbers in the right order
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 954.99 956.59 <NA> <unk> say computer 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 956.7 963.64 <NA> would you please now take the ten percent of those random sequences that did the best job <unk> save those kill off the rest <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 963.41 968.05 <NA> and now let 's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 968.04 979.94 <NA> and let 's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 979.9 981.08 <NA> <unk> two programs <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 980.68 993.47 <NA> so i 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job <unk> say please repeat that process score them again <unk> introduce some mutations perhaps <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 993.47 996.33 <NA> and try that again and do that for another generation 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 996.15 1000.2 <NA> well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 999.97 1004.16 <NA> so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1003.97 1004.97 <NA> within the computer
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1005.34 1008.87 <NA> in a few minutes or in the complicated cases in a few hours 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1008.64 1013.74 <NA> at the end of that i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1013.74 1019.01 <NA> in fact they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1018.67 1027.11 <NA> now if i look at those programs i can 't tell you how they work i 've tried looking at them and telling you how they work they 're obscure weird programs <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1026.83 1029.97 <NA> but they do the job <unk> and in fact i know
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1029.98 1038.67 <NA> 'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job <unk> in fact their life depended on doing the job 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1044.3 1049.84 <NA> laughter i was riding in a seven hundred and forty seven with marvin minsky once and he pulls out this card and says oh look
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1050.61 1057.91 <NA> <unk> look at this it says ' this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight '
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1057.9 1060.37 <NA> doesn 't that make you feel confident 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1061.89 1066.67 <NA> in fact we know that the engineering process doesn 't work very well when it gets complicated 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1066.81 1072.26 <NA> so we 're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that 's very different
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1072.02 1079.85 <NA> than engineering and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce <unk> and yet we don 't
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1079.84 1083.78 <NA> <unk> quite understand the options of it so in a sense it 's getting ahead of us 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1083.41 1093.05 <NA> we 're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we 'll be able to run this process much faster so it 's feeding back on itself the
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1092.89 1100.29 <NA> thing is becoming faster and that 's why i think it seems so confusing because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1100.79 1102.13 <NA> <unk> we 're taking off 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1101.92 1110.13 <NA> and what we are is we 're at a point in time which is analogous to when single celled organisms were turning into multi celled organisms so we
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1110.13 1117.09 <NA> 're the amoebas and we can 't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we 're creating we 're right at that point of transition <unk> 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1117.02 1125.02 <NA> but i think that there really is something coming along after us i think it 's very haughty of us to think that we 're the end product of evolution
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1125.43 1131.08 <NA> <unk> i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is 
DannyHillis_1994 1 DannyHillis_1994 1131.1 1137.69 <NA> so lunch is coming along <unk> and i think i will stop at that point before i get selected out
