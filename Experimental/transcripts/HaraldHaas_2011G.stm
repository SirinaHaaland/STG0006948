HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 61.95 65.63 <NA> it 's this importance why i decided
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 65.3 73.36 <NA> to look into the issues that this technology has because it 's so fundamental to our lives <unk> and one of the issues is capacity

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 98.53 99.75 <NA> there 's another
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 100.61 107.34 <NA> <unk> that is efficiency these one point four million cellular radio masts or base stations consume a lot of energy 
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 107.36 114.15 <NA> and mind you most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves <unk> it is used to cool the base stations <unk> 
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 113.93 118.32 <NA> then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent <unk>

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 122.24 129.85 <NA> then there 's another issue that you 're all aware of you have to switch off your mobile phone during flights in hospitals
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 129.99 133.01 <NA> <unk> are security issues and
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 132.77 135.06 <NA> security is another issue

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 166.09 174.74 <NA> then there 's ultraviolet light it 's good for a nice suntan but otherwise dangerous for the human body <unk> infrared
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 174.25 179.31 <NA> due to eye safety regulations can be only used with low power <unk> and then we have the radio waves
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 179.99 187.1 <NA> <unk> mentioned <unk> and in the middle there we have this visible light spectrum <unk> it 's light <unk> and light has been around

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 197.24 204.4 <NA> to use and wouldn 't it be great to use that for wireless communications not only that i compared
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 204.87 212.15 <NA> <unk> spectrum i compared the radio waves spectrum the size of it with the size of the visible light spectrum <unk> and guess what

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 218.61 224.62 <NA> so not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum <unk> let 's compare that with a number i 've just mentioned 
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 224.19 229.85 <NA> we have one point four million expensively deployed inefficient radio cellular base stations

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 238.58 247.43 <NA> so we have the infrastructure there look at the ceiling you see all these light bulbs go to the main floor <unk> you see these light bulbs can we use them for communications <unk>
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 251.99 253.33 <NA> <unk> one thing we need to do is
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 253.12 263.25 <NA> we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs <unk> florescent lights with this new technology of led led light bulbs <unk>

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 407.39 411.54 <NA> as you would expect it 's a light a desk lamp
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 411.32 418.23 <NA> put your book beneath it and you can read it 's illuminating the space <unk> but at the same time you see this

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 441.09 445.27 <NA> once again still don 't believe 
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 447.39 450.23 <NA> it is this light that transmits

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 469.9 474.96 <NA> we are able to transmit this data and you see even light from the ceiling comes down
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 490.64 500.23 <NA> <unk> do i have to have the light on all the time to have this working and the answer is yes but you can dim down the light
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 500.49 503.38 <NA> <unk> level that it appears to be off <unk> and you are still able to transmit data
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 503.18 504.64 <NA> that 's possible so
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 505.59 509.47 <NA> i 've mentioned to you the four challenges capacity <unk> 
HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 510.42 516.52 <NA> we have ten thousand times more spectrum ten thousand times more leds installed already in the infrastructure there <unk>

HaraldHaas_2011G 1 HaraldHaas_2011G 591.6 599.15 <NA> turn it away so the data goes in that direction not there anymore now we can in fact see where the data is going to
