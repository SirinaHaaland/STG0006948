EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 13.09 15.2 <NA> <unk> journey thirty years ago <unk> 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 14.71 23.19 <NA> and i worked in mines <unk> and i realized that this was a world unseen <unk> and i wanted through color and large format cameras and very large prints 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 23.19 27.41 <NA> to make a body of work that somehow became symbols
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 26.92 29.7 <NA> of our use of the
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 29.66 33.82 <NA> <unk> landscape how we use the land and to me this was
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 33.58 39.92 <NA> a key component that somehow through this medium of photography which allows us to contemplate these landscapes 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 39.92 44.91 <NA> that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work <unk> 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 44.42 50.92 <NA> and after seventeen years of photographing large industrial landscapes it occurred to me that
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 50.74 53.92 <NA> oil is underpinning the scale and speed because that
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 54.99 63.85 <NA> <unk> is the speed at which we 're taking all our resources <unk> and so then i went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil and
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 63.57 71.93 <NA> what i want to do is is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction where we 're taking it from the ground refinement and that 's one chapter 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 71.93 79.97 <NA> the other chapter that i wanted to look at was how we use it our cities our cars our motorcultures where people gather
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 80.08 83.54 <NA> <unk> around the vehicle as a celebration <unk> 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 83.26 92.9 <NA> and then the third one is this idea of the end of oil this entropic end where all of our parts of cars our tires oil filters 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 92.9 98.19 <NA> helicopters planes where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 97.96 104.7 <NA> and to me <unk> again photography was a way in which i could explore and research the world and find those places
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 104.93 109.02 <NA> and another idea that i had as well that was brought forward
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 109.37 118.86 <NA> by an ecologist he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of of gas and said well how much carbon it would take and how much
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 118.86 124.99 <NA> organic material it was twenty three metric tons for one liter so whenever i fill up my gas i
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 125 131.8 <NA> i think of that liter and how much carbon and i know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton but he did the calculations
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 131.79 142.57 <NA> for our earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy from the photosynthetic growth it would take five hundred years of that growth to produce what we use the thirty billion
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 142.26 150.26 <NA> barrels we use per year <unk> and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 151.21 152.64 <NA> <unk> looking at
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 152.4 159.5 <NA> thirty billion per year we look at our two largest suppliers saudi arabia and now canada with its dirty oil 
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 159.5 164.91 <NA> and together they only form about fifteen years of supply the whole world at one point two trillion
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 164.73 171.12 <NA> estimated reserves only gives us about forty five years so it 's not a question of if but a question of when
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 170.91 179.94 <NA> peak oil will come upon us so to me using photography and i feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 1 EdwardBurtynsky_2009G 180.11 189.91 <NA> our ways of thinking to begin to deal with what i think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time how to deal with our energy crisis
