SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 12.79 25.17 <NA> <unk> i study how the brain processes information that is how it takes information in from the outside world and converts it into patterns of electrical activity <unk> and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things to see hear
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 25.16 26.76 <NA> <unk> to reach for an object <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 26.54 32.59 <NA> so i 'm really a basic scientist not a clinician <unk> but in the last year and a half i 've started to switch over 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 32.59 37.41 <NA> to use what we 've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 37.1 39.6 <NA> and what i wanted to do today is
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 39.2 47.28 <NA> show you an example of this it 's really our first foray into this it 's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness <unk>
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 46.91 49.71 <NA> so let me start in on that problem 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 49.46 54.94 <NA> there are ten million people in the u s and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 54.9 58.66 <NA> <unk> due to diseases of the retina <unk> diseases like macular degeneration 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 58.17 60.61 <NA> and there 's little that can be done for them 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 60.12 64.79 <NA> there are some drug treatments but they 're only effective on a small fraction of the population
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 64.79 70.81 <NA> <unk> and so for the vast majority of patients their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 70.5 72.35 <NA> the problem is that
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 72.17 79.49 <NA> current prosthetics don 't work very well <unk> they 're still very limited in the vision that they can provide <unk> and so you know for example with these devices
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 79.9 88.79 <NA> <unk> can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges <unk> not very much more <unk> so nothing nothing close to normal vision has been possible 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 88.54 98.84 <NA> so what i 'm going to tell you about today is a device that we 've been working on that that i think has the potential to to make a difference to be much more effective <unk> and what i wanted to do is show you how it works <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 98.59 104.85 <NA> okay so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve here you have a
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 104.78 108.48 <NA> <unk> retina so you have an image a retina and a brain 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 108.14 116.88 <NA> so when you look at something like this image of this baby 's face <unk> it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina on the front end cells here <unk> the photoreceptors 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 116.81 124.9 <NA> then what happens is the retinal circuitry the middle part goes to work on it and what it does is it it performs operations on it it extracts information from
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 125.37 128.59 <NA> <unk> and it converts that information into a code <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 128.4 136.61 <NA> and the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain <unk> and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 136.28 144.16 <NA> into a code <unk> and when i say code i do literally mean code <unk> like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby 's face 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 143.96 149.56 <NA> and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses it knows that what was out there was a baby 's face <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 149.56 154.91 <NA> and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was say a dog or another pattern would be a house
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 154.95 156.98 <NA> anyway you get the idea 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 156.97 161.81 <NA> and of course in real life it 's all dynamic <unk> meaning that it 's changing all the time <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 161.81 167.51 <NA> so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you 're looking at is is changing all the time too
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 167.11 174.93 <NA> <unk> so you know it 's sort of a complicated thing you have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you 're
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 176.12 185.67 <NA> <unk> so what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration what happens is is that the front end cells die <unk> the photoreceptors die <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 185.42 190.71 <NA> and over time all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them they die too <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 190.4 200.22 <NA> until the only things that you have left are these cells here the output cells the ones that send the signals to the brain <unk> but because of all that degeneration they aren 't sending any signals anymore 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 200.63 204.79 <NA> they aren 't getting any input so the person 's brain no longer gets any visual information
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 205.14 207.76 <NA> <unk> that is he or she is blind 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 208.74 220.75 <NA> so a solution to the problem then would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front end circuitry and send signals to the retina 's output cells and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 220.83 229.79 <NA> so this is what we 've been working on and this is what our prosthetic does so it consists of two parts what we call an encoder and a transducer
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 229.9 243.8 <NA> and so the encoder does just what i was saying it mimics the actions of the front end circuitry so it takes images in and converts them into the retina 's code <unk> and then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain and the result is
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 243.91 247.94 <NA> a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 248.44 254.61 <NA> so a completely blind retina even one with no front end circuitry at all no photoreceptors can now
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 254.96 264.69 <NA> <unk> send out normal signals signals that the brain can understand <unk> so no other device has been able to do this <unk> okay so i just want to take
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 264.29 268.23 <NA> a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it 's doing because
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 267.77 274.93 <NA> it 's really the key part and it 's sort of interesting and kind of cool i 'm not sure cool is really the right word but you know what i mean
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 276.51 282.14 <NA> <unk> what it 's doing is it 's replacing the retinal circuitry really the guts of the retinal circuitry with
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 281.9 288.31 <NA> a set of equations a set of equations that we can implement on a chip <unk> so it 's just math 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 288.03 298.73 <NA> in other words we 're not literally replacing the components of the retina it 's not like we 're making a little mini device for each of the different cell types we 've just abstracted what the what the retina 's doing
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 298.55 304.94 <NA> with a set of equations <unk> and so in a way the equations are serving as sort of a codebook an image comes
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 304.9 312.32 <NA> <unk> in goes through the set of equations <unk> and out comes streams of electrical pulses just like a normal retina would produce <unk>
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 312.97 320.69 <NA> now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output <unk> and what the what the implications of this are
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 321.16 328.92 <NA> here are three sets of firing patterns the top one is from a normal animal <unk> the middle one is from a blind animal that 's been treated with
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 329.9 337.24 <NA> <unk> device and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic so the bottom one is the state of the art device that 's out there
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 337.06 345.21 <NA> right now which is basically made up of light detectors <unk> but no encoder <unk> so what we did was we presented movies of everyday things people babies 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 345.2 347.91 <NA> park benches you know regular things happening
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 347.45 354.16 <NA> and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals now just to orient you
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 354.81 362.14 <NA> <unk> box is showing the firing patterns of several cells and just as in the previous slides <unk> each row is a different cell <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 361.92 367.63 <NA> and i just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so i could show you a long stretch of data
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 367.68 372.31 <NA> <unk> so as you can see the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the <unk>
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 373.77 379.94 <NA> really do very closely match the normal firing patterns and it 's not perfect but it 's pretty
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 380.34 385.25 <NA> and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic the responses really don 't 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 384.91 393.08 <NA> and so with the standard method <unk> the cells do fire they just don 't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don 't have the right code <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 392.86 396.05 <NA> how important is is this 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 396.43 401.73 <NA> what 's the potential impact on a patient 's ability to see so i 'm just going to show you one
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 404.87 413.71 <NA> <unk> and of course i 've got a lot of other data so if you 're interested i 'm happy to show to show more <unk> so the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment <unk> so what we did is we took
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 413.47 422.26 <NA> a moment in time from these recordings and asked what was the retina seeing at that moment can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 422.26 424.95 <NA> from the responses from the firing patterns 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 426.72 429.4 <NA> <unk> when we did this for responses from
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 429.42 433.42 <NA> the standard method and from from our encoder and transducer <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 433.32 437.08 <NA> so let me show you and i 'm going to start with the standard method first
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 436.65 444.81 <NA> so you can see that it 's pretty limited and because the firing patterns aren 't in the right code <unk> they 're very limited in what they can tell you about what 's out there 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 444.81 447.11 <NA> so you can see that there 's something there but it
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 446.9 449.41 <NA> 's not so clear what that something is 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 448.98 453.83 <NA> and this just sort of circles back to what i was saying in the beginning that with the standard method patients can see
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 455.08 459.29 <NA> <unk> edges they can see light <unk> but it it doesn 't easily go further than that <unk>
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 459.4 463.82 <NA> so what was the image <unk> it was a baby 's face
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 463.81 466.59 <NA> <unk> so what about with our approach 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 466.59 474.74 <NA> adding the code <unk> and you can see that it 's much better not only can you tell that it 's a baby 's face but you can tell that it 's this baby 's face which is a really challenging task <unk>
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 475.03 479.85 <NA> so on the left is the encoder alone <unk> and on the right is from an actual blind retina
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 480.07 488.49 <NA> so the encoder and the transducer <unk> but the key one really is the encoder alone because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer <unk> this is just actually the first one that we tried 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 488.12 491.25 <NA> i just wanted to say something about the standard method
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 490.85 498.75 <NA> when this first came out it was just a really exciting thing <unk> the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 498.38 500.05 <NA> but there was
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 500.52 508.84 <NA> <unk> this limiting factor the issue of the code <unk> and how to make the cells respond better produce normal responses <unk> and so this this was our contribution <unk>
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 509.4 513.97 <NA> <unk> now i just want to wrap up and
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 513.48 518.59 <NA> as i was mentioning earlier of course i have a lot of other data if you 're interested but i just wanted to give this sort of basic <unk>
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 519.87 524.93 <NA> <unk> idea of being able to communicate with the brain in in
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 525 532.32 <NA> <unk> its language and the potential power of being able to do that so it 's different from the motor prosthetics where you 're communicating from the brain to
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 532.08 540.29 <NA> to a device here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood <unk> and be understood by the brain <unk> 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 540.13 543.89 <NA> and then the last thing i wanted to say really is
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 544 550.02 <NA> to emphasize that the idea generalizes <unk> so the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 552.17 561.24 <NA> <unk> for example the auditory system and the motor system so for treating deafness and for and for motor disorders so just the same way that we were able to jump over the
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 561.26 564.63 <NA> the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina 's output cells 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 564.63 574.86 <NA> we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve or jump over damaged areas in the cortex in the motor cortex to bridge the gap
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 577.68 579.97 <NA> <unk> i just want to end with a simple message that
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 579.51 589.6 <NA> understanding the code is really really important <unk> and if we can understand the code <unk> the language of the brain things become possible that that didn 't seem obviously possible before 
SheilaNirenberg_2011P 1 SheilaNirenberg_2011P 589.2 590.24 <NA> thank you
