EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 14.65 24.14 <NA> <unk> when you 're faced with a complex problem well i hope to change that in less than three minutes <unk> so i hope to convince you that complex doesn 't always equal complicated <unk> 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 26.39 33.45 <NA> <unk> fresh out of the oven is complex but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 33.56 40.38 <NA> i 'm an ecologist and i study complexity i love complexity and i study that in the natural world the interconnectedness of species 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 40.38 46.89 <NA> so here 's a food web or a map of feeding links between species that live in alpine lakes in the mountains of california <unk> 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 46.4 49.96 <NA> and this is what happens to that food web when it 's stocked with
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 50.34 55.32 <NA> <unk> fish that never lived there before all the grayed out species disappear some are actually on the brink of extinction <unk> 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 55.33 62.32 <NA> and lakes with fish have more mosquitos <unk> even though they eat them these effects were all unanticipated and yet we 're discovering they 're predictable 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 61.86 68.98 <NA> so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we 're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 69.48 77.12 <NA> first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn 't think of before 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 77.12 79.51 <NA> for example you could plot the
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 79.87 83.42 <NA> <unk> carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem or
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 83.22 88.4 <NA> the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 88.36 98.54 <NA> the next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another if you focus only on that link and then you black box the rest <unk> it 's actually less predictable than <unk>
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 98.44 104.94 <NA> <unk> if you step back <unk> consider the entire system all the species all the links and from that place hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 104.81 110.73 <NA> <unk> most and we 're discovering with our research that 's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees <unk> 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 110.42 118.89 <NA> so the more you step back embrace complexity <unk> the better chance you have of finding simple answers and it 's often different than the simple answer that you started with 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 118.64 124.65 <NA> so let 's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the u s government 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 125.1 130.81 <NA> <unk> this is a diagram of the <unk> u s counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 130.64 141.13 <NA> instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated <unk> and the stated goal was to increase popular support for the afghan government <unk> clearly a complex problem <unk>
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 141.08 149.2 <NA> <unk> but is it complicated <unk> well when i saw this in the front page of the times i thought great finally something i can relate to i can sink my teeth into this 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 154.93 162.86 <NA> <unk> network the circled node is the one we 're trying to influence popular support for the government and so now we can look one degrees two degrees <unk> three degrees away from that node
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 162.66 167.49 <NA> and eliminate three quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence within that sphere 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 167.49 174.05 <NA> most of those nodes are not actionable like the harshness of the terrain and a very small minority are actual military actions
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 173.59 174.9 <NA> <unk> most are
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 175.04 177.96 <NA> <unk> and they fall into two broad categories 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 177.74 185.31 <NA> active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair <unk> transparent economic development and provisioning of services
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 184.82 194.8 <NA> <unk> i don 't know about this but this is what i can decipher from this diagram in twenty four seconds when you see a diagram like this <unk> i don 't want you to be afraid i want you to be excited i want you to be relieved <unk> 
EricBerlow_2010G 1 EricBerlow_2010G 194.59 208.45 <NA> because simple answers may emerge <unk> we 're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity so for any problem the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most
