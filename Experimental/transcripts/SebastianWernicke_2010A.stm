SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 30.43 41.92 <NA> and it got me wondering if you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis <unk> could you reverse engineer a tedtalk could you create the ultimate tedtalk 
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 41.73 42.81 <NA> and
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 43.61 49.8 <NA> also <unk> could you create the worst possible tedtalk that they would still let you get away with 
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 49.79 54.94 <NA> to find this out i looked at three things i looked at the topic that you should choose i

SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 58.52 69.26 <NA> now with the topic there 's a whole range of topics you can choose but you should choose wisely because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk 
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 69.26 74.99 <NA> now to make this more concrete let 's look at the list of top ten words that

SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 104.93 108.08 <NA> <unk> generalize this the most favorite tedtalks are those
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 107.92 118.26 <NA> that feature topics we can connect with both easily and deeply such as happiness our own body food emotions <unk> and the more technical <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 118.21 124.51 <NA> topics such as architecture <unk> materials and strangely enough men those are not good topics to talk about
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 125.55 127.09 <NA> <unk> how should you deliver your talk 
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 127.09 138.37 <NA> ted is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock <unk> so they 're going to hate me for revealing this because actually you should talk as long as they will let you because the
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 138.09 144.22 <NA> most favorite tedtalks are on average over fifty percent longer than the least favorite ones <unk>

SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 166.18 179.79 <NA> <unk> while you 're pushing the clock there 's a few rules to obey <unk> i found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite tedtalks as opposed to the least favorite tedtalks <unk> i 'll give you three examples
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 180.02 186.82 <NA> <unk> of all i must as a speaker provide a service to the audience and talk about what i will give you instead of saying what i can 't have 
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 186.82 191.46 <NA> secondly it 's imperative that you do not cite the new york times 
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 192.62 200.17 <NA> and finally it 's okay for the speaker that 's the good news to fake intellectual capacity if i don 't understand something i can just say
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 209.34 215.11 <NA> now let 's go to the visuals the most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker and analysis <unk>

SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 268.07 274.99 <NA> good judgment so now it 's time to put it all together and design the ultimate tedtalk now <unk> since
SebastianWernicke_2010A 1 SebastianWernicke_2010A 276.69 289.84 <NA> <unk> i learned from my analysis that i should actually give you something i will not impose the ultimate or worst tedtalk on you but rather give you a tool to create your own <unk> and i call this tool the tedpad and
