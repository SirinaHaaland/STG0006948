PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 815.76 823.45 <NA> i don 't think so i don 't think it 's going to get to that extreme but when we are going about hacking the human code 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 822.96 828.82 <NA> i think all bets are off in terms of what might come of that there would still be dangers 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 829.93 839.57 <NA> <unk> can look in the past to other elements of transformative science and see how they can basically go out of control and permeate society 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 839.08 843.77 <NA> so i 'll just give you one example and that is in vitro fertilization
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 844 849.99 <NA> almost exactly forty years ago <unk> test tube baby number one louise
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 850 853.95 <NA> brown was born <unk> and that 's a great thing and i think
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 853.75 862.2 <NA> since then five million ivf babies have been born <unk> bringing immeasurable happiness a lot of parents now can love
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 862 871.23 <NA> those kids <unk> but if you think about it in four decades five million babies being born from a new technology is pretty remarkable <unk> 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 870.89 873.7 <NA> and the same kind of thing could happen
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 873.49 879.97 <NA> with human genetic modification and designer babies <unk> so depending on the decisions we make in the next few
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 879.93 889.6 <NA> <unk> months the next year or so if designer baby number one is born within a few decades there could well be millions of genetically modified humans <unk> 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 889.32 892.6 <NA> and there 's a difference there too because if we 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 892.37 896.99 <NA> you in the audience or i if we decide to have a designer baby 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 896.99 903.98 <NA> then their children will also be genetically modified and so on because it 's heritable so that 's a big difference
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 905.53 909.5 <NA> <unk> so with all of this in mind what should we do 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 909.64 914.7 <NA> there 's actually going to be a meeting a month from tomorrow in washington d c 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 914.7 919.4 <NA> by the us national academy of sciences to tackle that exact question 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 918.94 923.6 <NA> what is the right path forward with human genetic modification <unk> 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 923.53 926.27 <NA> i believe at this time
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 925.93 929.97 <NA> we need a moratorium we have to ban this we should not
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 930.02 936.81 <NA> <unk> allow creating genetically modified people because it 's just too dangerous and too unpredictable <unk> 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 936.86 939.09 <NA> but there 's a lot of people thanks 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 947.39 950.06 <NA> and let me say just as a scientist 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 950.06 953.79 <NA> it 's a little bit scary for me to say that in public because
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 953.3 954.97 <NA> science generally
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 956.85 958.42 <NA> <unk> and things like that 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 958.8 972.77 <NA> so i think we need to put a hold on this <unk> but there are many people who not only disagree with me they feel the exact opposite they 're like step on the gas <unk> full speed ahead let 's make designer babies <unk> and so
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 972.54 979.91 <NA> in the meeting in december and other meetings that are likely to follow in the next few months <unk> it 's very possible there may be no
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 979.81 984.14 <NA> <unk> moratorium <unk> and i think part of the problem that we have
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 984.14 993.69 <NA> is that all of this trend this revolution in genetic modification applying to humans the public hasn 't known about it nobody has been
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 993.45 995.69 <NA> saying <unk> look <unk> this
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 995.38 1000.05 <NA> is a big deal this is a revolution <unk> and this could affect you in very personal
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1000.46 1009.3 <NA> <unk> and so part of my goal is actually to change that and to educate and engage with the public and get you guys talking about this <unk> 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1009.3 1016.31 <NA> and so i hope at these meetings that there will be a role for for the public to bring their voice to bear as well <unk> 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1017.2 1024.87 <NA> so if we kind of circle back now to two thousand and thirty again that imagined story <unk> and depending on the decisions we
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1026.24 1033.18 <NA> <unk> literally we don 't have a lot of time in the next few months the next year or so because this technology is spreading like wildfire 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1033.08 1039.46 <NA> let 's pretend we 're back in that reality we 're at a park and
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1039.01 1041.91 <NA> our kid is swinging on the swing <unk>
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1042.11 1048.66 <NA> is that kid a regular old kid or did we decide to have a designer baby <unk> 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1048.2 1054.97 <NA> and let 's say we we went the sort of traditional route <unk> and there 's our kid swinging on the swing and
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1055.04 1060.04 <NA> frankly <unk> they 're kind of a mess <unk> their hair is all over the place like mine 
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1059.85 1064.93 <NA> they have a stuffy nose <unk> they 're not the best student in the world
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1064.62 1070.82 <NA> <unk> they 're adorable you love them <unk> but there on the swing next to them their best friend
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1070.64 1075.05 <NA> is a gm kid <unk> and the two of them are kind of swinging like this and you can
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1075 1084.62 <NA> <unk> help but compare them right and the gm kid is swinging higher they look better they 're a better student <unk> they don 't have that stuffy nose you need to wipe
PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1 PaulKnoepfler_2015X 1084.28 1089.61 <NA> how is that going to make you feel and what decision might you make next time
