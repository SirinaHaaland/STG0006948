FransDeWaal_2011X 1 FransDeWaal_2011X 591.75 604.85 <NA> we also study more complex expressions this is consolation this is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he 's screaming and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him and calms him down that 's consolation it 's very similar to human consolation

FransDeWaal_2011X 1 FransDeWaal_2011X 617.82 622.32 <NA> and so it is related to empathy and that 's the kind of expressions we look at 
FransDeWaal_2011X 1 FransDeWaal_2011X 622.13 624.96 <NA> we also recently published an experiment you may have heard about

FransDeWaal_2011X 1 FransDeWaal_2011X 681.49 691.35 <NA> needs to give it to us <unk> we pick it up <unk> we put it on a table where there 's two food rewards but in this case only the one on the right gets food the one on the left walks away because
