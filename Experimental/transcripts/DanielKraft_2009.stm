DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 12.97 16.01 <NA> <unk> i am a pediatric cancer doctor
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 15.61 24.87 <NA> and stem cell researcher at stanford university where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation <unk> now <unk> inspired by jill bolte taylor last year i didn 't bring a
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 25.94 29.1 <NA> <unk> but i did bring a liter of bone marrow 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 28.61 39.03 <NA> and bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases <unk> 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 38.99 43.54 <NA> so a few years ago i 'm doing my transplant fellowship at stanford i 'm
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 43.54 50.08 <NA> in the operating room <unk> we have bob here who is a volunteer donor we 're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 51.54 57.38 <NA> <unk> so actually how do we harvest this bone marrow well we have a whole o r team general anesthesia nurses <unk> and
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 57.38 64.87 <NA> another doctor across from me bob 's on the table and we take this sort of small needle you know not too big <unk> and the way we do this is we basically
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 65.01 71.89 <NA> place this through the soft tissue and kind of punch it into the hard bone into the tuchus that 's a technical term and
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 71.7 75.11 <NA> aspirate about ten mls of bone marrow out
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 75.28 77.19 <NA> <unk> each time with a syringe <unk> 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 76.95 83.58 <NA> and hand it off to the nurse she squirts it into a tin hands it back to me <unk> and we do that again and again 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 83.37 92.65 <NA> about two hundred times usually <unk> and by the end of this my arm is sore i 've got a callus on my hand let alone bob whose rear end looks something more like this like swiss cheese 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 92.65 104.37 <NA> so i 'm thinking you know this procedure hasn 't changed in about forty years <unk> and there is probably a better way to do this so i thought of a minimally invasive approach and a new device that we call the marrow miner
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 105.89 115.56 <NA> and the marrow miner the way it works is shown here our standard see through patient instead of entering the bone dozens of times we enter just once into the front of the hip or the back of the hip <unk> 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 115.56 129.07 <NA> and we have a flexible powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip as it moves around so it enables you to very rapidly aspirate or suck out rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 128.88 130 <NA> we can do multiple passes
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 130.11 139.54 <NA> <unk> through that same entry no robots required and <unk> so very quickly bob can just get one puncture local anesthesia <unk> and do this harvest as an outpatient <unk> 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 139.26 144.44 <NA> so i did a few prototypes <unk> i got a small little grant at stanford and
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 144.27 148.18 <NA> played around with this a little bit and our team members developed this technology and
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 147.9 149.9 <NA> eventually we got two large animals and
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 150.7 158.49 <NA> <unk> and we found to our surprise that we not only got bone marrow out but we got ten times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the marrow miner compared to the normal device 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 158.49 167.09 <NA> this device was just fda approved in the last year here is a live patient you can see it following the flexible curves around there will be two passes here in the same patient from the same hole
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 166.63 174.78 <NA> this was done under local anesthesia as an outpatient <unk> and we got again about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient <unk> 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 174.78 179.97 <NA> so why should you care bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells you all know about embryonic
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 179.9 191.43 <NA> <unk> stem cells they 've got great potential but haven 't yet entered clinical trials adult stem cells are throughout our body including the blood forming stem cells in our bone marrow <unk> which we 've been using as a form of stem cell therapy for over forty years 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 191.12 203.11 <NA> in the last decade there 's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient 's other diseases such as heart disease <unk> vascular disease <unk> orthopedics tissue engineering even in neurology to treat parkinson 's
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 202.95 204.46 <NA> and diabetes
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 204.99 215.41 <NA> <unk> we 've just come out we 're commercializing this year <unk> generation two point zero of the marrow miner the hope is that this gets more stem cells out <unk> which translates to better outcomes it may encourage more people to sign up to be potential <unk>
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 215.36 223.81 <NA> live saving bone marrow donors it may even even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells when you 're younger and healthier to use in the future should you need it 
DanielKraft_2009 1 DanielKraft_2009 230.01 234.54 <NA> hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future thanks
