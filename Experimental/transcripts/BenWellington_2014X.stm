BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 12.88 19.47 <NA> <unk> six thousand miles of road six hundred miles of subway track four hundred miles of bike lanes
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 19.47 24.81 <NA> and a half a mile of tram track if you 've ever been to roosevelt island these are the numbers that make up the
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 25.46 38.4 <NA> <unk> of new york city these are the statistics of our infrastructure they 're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies for example the department of transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain the mta will boast how many miles of subway track there are 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 38.4 45.78 <NA> most city agencies give us statistics this is from a report this year from the taxi and limousine commission where we learn that there 's about thirteen <unk>
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 46.78 53.92 <NA> taxis here in new york city <unk> pretty interesting right <unk> but did you ever think about where these numbers came from because for these numbers to exist
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 54.84 57.61 <NA> <unk> city agency had to stop and say hmm 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 57.12 61.1 <NA> here 's a number that somebody might want want to know here 's a number that our citizens want to know 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 61.1 68.83 <NA> so they go back to their raw data <unk> they count they add they calculate <unk> and then they put out reports and those reports will have numbers like this 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 68.58 77.2 <NA> the problem is how do they know all of our questions we have lots of questions <unk> in fact <unk> in some ways there 's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 77.2 79.76 <NA> the agencies can never keep up so the
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 79.69 82.05 <NA> <unk> paradigm isn 't exactly working and i think
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 81.84 91.76 <NA> our policymakers realize that because in two thousand and twelve <unk> mayor bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 91.48 97.76 <NA> in a lot of ways he 's right <unk> in the last two years the city has released one thousand datasets on our open data portal <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 97.76 104.88 <NA> and it 's pretty awesome <unk> so you go and look at data like this and instead of just counting the number of cabs we can start to ask different questions
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 104.92 106.59 <NA> so i had a question <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 106.13 110.77 <NA> when 's rush hour in new york city it can be pretty bothersome when is rush hour exactly <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 110.59 117.86 <NA> and i thought to myself these cabs aren 't just numbers these are gps recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 117.86 129.37 <NA> there 's data there <unk> and i looked at that data and i made a plot of the average speed of taxis in new york city throughout the day you can see that from about midnight to around five eighteen in the morning <unk> speed increases and at that point
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 129.96 131.32 <NA> <unk> things turn around and
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 130.98 141.32 <NA> they get slower and slower and slower until about eight thirty five in the morning when they end up at around eleven and a half miles per hour the average taxi is going eleven and a half miles per hour on our city streets <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 141.32 143.47 <NA> and it turns out it stays that way
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 143.55 152.81 <NA> for the entire day so i said to myself i guess there 's no rush hour in new york city there 's just a rush day
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 155.13 157.67 <NA> for a couple of reasons if you 're a transportation planner 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 157.44 167.63 <NA> this might be pretty interesting to know <unk> but if you want to get somewhere quickly you now know to set your alarm for four forty five in the morning and you 're all set new york right <unk> but there 's a story behind this data this data wasn <unk>
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 167.53 172.95 <NA> <unk> 't just available it turns out it actually came from something called a freedom of information law request <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 179.99 183.86 <NA> <unk> fill it out <unk> and they will notify you and a guy named chris whong
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 183.87 192.93 <NA> did exactly that chris went down <unk> and they told him just bring a brand new hard drive down to our office leave it here for five hours we 'll copy the data and you take it back 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 192.47 195.09 <NA> and that 's where this data came from 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 194.72 201.51 <NA> now chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public and so it ended up online for all to use and that 's where this graph came from and
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 201.51 204.97 <NA> the fact that it exists is amazing these gps recorders really cool
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 205.31 218.86 <NA> <unk> but the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives picking up data from city agencies to make it public it was already kind of public you could get to it but it was public it wasn 't public <unk> and we can do better than that as a city we don 't need our citizens walking around with hard drives 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 218.67 219.92 <NA> now 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 219.92 228.55 <NA> not every dataset is behind a foil request <unk> here is a map i made with the most dangerous intersections in new york city based on cyclist accidents <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 228.33 229.97 <NA> so the red areas are more
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 229.93 235.79 <NA> <unk> dangerous and what it shows is first the east side of manhattan especially in the lower lower area of manhattan
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 235.33 249.5 <NA> has more cyclist accidents that might make sense because there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there <unk> but there 's other hotspots worth studying there 's williamsburg there 's roosevelt avenue in queens <unk> and this is exactly the kind of data we need for vision zero this is exactly what we 're looking for
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 250.61 255.72 <NA> <unk> story behind this data as well this data didn 't just appear how many of you guys know this logo <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 255.95 261.25 <NA> yeah i see some shakes have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a pdf and make sense of it 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 261.01 262.75 <NA> i see more shakes 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 262.57 265.36 <NA> more of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo i like that
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 265.36 275.17 <NA> so what happened is the data that you just saw was actually on a pdf <unk> in fact hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of pdf put out by our very own nypd 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 274.93 279.97 <NA> and in order to access it you would either have to copy and paste for hundreds and hundreds of hours <unk> or you could be john
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 280.05 286.7 <NA> <unk> krauss <unk> john krauss was like i 'm not going to copy and paste this data i 'm going to write a program it 's called the nypd crash data
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 287.75 300.08 <NA> and it goes to the nypd 's website and it would download pdfs every day it would search <unk> if it found a pdf it would download it and then it would run some pdf scraping program and out would come the text and it would go on the internet <unk> and then people could make maps like
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 301.57 311.18 <NA> <unk> the fact that the data 's here the fact that we have access to it every accident by the way is a row in this table you can imagine how many pdfs that is the fact that we have access to that is great <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 310.81 325.02 <NA> but let 's not release it in pdf form <unk> because then we 're having our citizens write pdf scrapers it 's not the best use of our citizens ' time and we as a city can do better than that now the good news is that the de blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 325.61 337.05 <NA> <unk> and so now we can actually have access to it but there 's a lot of data still entombed in pdf for example our crime data is still only available in pdf and not just our crime data our own city budget
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 336.77 347.01 <NA> our city budget is only readable right now in pdf form <unk> and it 's not just us that can 't analyze it our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in <unk>
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 346.91 354.82 <NA> <unk> pdf <unk> so our legislators cannot analyze the budget that they are voting for and i think as a city we can do a little better than that as well
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 354.96 364.27 <NA> 's a lot of data that 's not hidden in pdfs this is an example of a map i made <unk> and this is the dirtiest waterways in new york city <unk> now how do i measure dirty well it 's
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 364.08 368.38 <NA> kind of a little weird but i looked at the level of fecal coliform
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 367.98 374.62 <NA> which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways <unk> the larger the circle <unk> the dirtier the water <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 374.25 379.61 <NA> so the large circles are dirty water the small circles are cleaner what you see is inland waterways
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 379.75 382.86 <NA> <unk> all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 382.65 386.81 <NA> and inland waterways are in general dirtier that makes sense right <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 386.81 393.2 <NA> and the bigger circles are dirty and i learned a few things from this number one never swim in anything that ends in creek or canal 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 393.88 400.11 <NA> but number two i also found the dirtiest waterway in new york city by this measure <unk> one measure <unk> in coney
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 400.73 410.68 <NA> <unk> which is not the coney island you swim in luckily it 's on the other side <unk> but coney island creek ninety four percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 410.5 413.85 <NA> that it would be against state law to swim in the water <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 413.63 423.76 <NA> and this is not the kind of fact that you 're going to see boasted in a city report right it 's not going to be the front page on nyc gov you 're not going to see it there <unk> but the fact that we can get to that data is awesome <unk>
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 423.76 429.85 <NA> but once again it wasn 't super easy because this data was not on the open data portal <unk> if you were to go to the open data portal you 'd see just a snippet of it
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 429.84 438.79 <NA> <unk> year or a few months it was actually on the department of environmental protection 's website and each one of these links is an excel sheet <unk> and each excel sheet is different <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 438.75 449.96 <NA> every heading is different you copy paste reorganize when you do you can make maps and that 's great but once again we can do better than that as a city we can normalize things <unk> and we 're getting there because there 's this website that socrata makes called
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 452.44 456.72 <NA> <unk> hundred data sets that don 't suffer from the things i just told you live and that number is growing <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 456.72 464.81 <NA> and that 's great you can download data in any format be it csv or pdf <unk> <unk> or excel document whatever you want you can download the data that way <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 464.77 468.15 <NA> the problem is once you do you will find
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 467.97 474.99 <NA> that each agency codes their addresses differently <unk> so one is street name intersection street street borough address building building address
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 475.37 485.15 <NA> <unk> so once again you 're spending time <unk> even when we have this portal <unk> you 're spending time normalizing our address fields <unk> and that 's not the best use of our citizens ' time <unk> we can do better than that as a city 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 484.99 493.22 <NA> we can standardize our addresses <unk> and if we do <unk> we can get more maps like this this is a map of fire hydrants in new york city <unk> but not just any fire hydrants 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 493.22 498 <NA> these are the top two hundred and fifty grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 499.43 504.97 <NA> laughter so i learned a few things from this map and i really like this map number one just don 't park on the
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 504.9 509.44 <NA> <unk> upper east side just don 't it doesn 't matter where you park you will get a hydrant ticket 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 509.01 520.18 <NA> number two i found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of new york city and they 're on the lower east side <unk> and they were bringing in over fifty five thousand dollars a year a year in parking tickets <unk> 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 520.17 526.04 <NA> and that seemed a little strange to me when i noticed it so i did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 525.86 529.73 <NA> and then something called a curb extension <unk> which is like a seven foot space to walk on
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 529.93 541.79 <NA> <unk> and then a parking spot <unk> and so these cars came along and the hydrant it 's all the way over there i 'm fine and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them <unk> they would park there <unk> and the nypd disagreed with this designation and would ticket them
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 541.79 546.41 <NA> <unk> and it wasn 't just me who found a parking ticket <unk> this is the google street view car driving by
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 546.01 549.9 <NA> finding the same parking ticket <unk> so i wrote about

BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 562.49 571.71 <NA> i thought to myself <unk> typical government response all right moved on with my life but then a few weeks later something incredible happened 
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 571.64 579.97 <NA> they repainted the spot and for a second i thought i saw the future of open data because think about what happened here for five years
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 580.05 588.47 <NA> <unk> for five years <unk> this spot was being ticketed and it was confusing and then a citizen found something they told the city and within a few weeks
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 588.26 598.81 <NA> the problem was fixed <unk> it 's amazing and a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog it 's not it 's about being a partner <unk> we can empower our citizens to be better partners for government and it 's not <unk>
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 598.76 604.61 <NA> that hard all we need are a few changes <unk> if you 're foiling data if you 're seeing your data being foiled over and over again

BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 607.23 616.5 <NA> and if you 're a government agency releasing a pdf let 's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data because that data is coming from somewhere i don 't know where
BenWellington_2014X 1 BenWellington_2014X 616.5 629.97 <NA> but it 's coming from somewhere and you can release it with the pdf and let 's adopt and share some open data standards let 's start with our addresses here in new york city let 's just start normalizing our addresses because new york is a leader in open data despite all this we are absolutely a
