SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 891.9 894.17 <NA> but we need new models
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 893.99 901.75 <NA> to think about medicine in the future <unk> that 's what 's at stake <unk> you know there 's a popular trope
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 901.44 904.97 <NA> out there that the reason we haven 't had the transformative
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 905.8 913.34 <NA> impact on the treatment of illness is because we don 't have powerful enough drugs <unk> and that 's partly true <unk> 
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 913.66 919.07 <NA> but perhaps the real reason is that we don 't have powerful enough ways of thinking about medicines <unk> 
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 920.05 924.35 <NA> it 's certainly true that it would be lovely
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 923.98 925.02 <NA> to have
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 926.69 934.05 <NA> <unk> but perhaps what 's really at stake are three more intangible m 's mechanisms models <unk> 
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 933.65 935.09 <NA> metaphors <unk> 
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 935.09 936.21 <NA> thank you 
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 945.23 949.05 <NA> chris anderson i really like this metaphor
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 949.04 952.23 <NA> how does it link in there 's a lot of talk
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 952.11 953.11 <NA> in
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 955.31 963.97 <NA> of medicine that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically your genome your current context
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 963.51 967.18 <NA> <unk> does that apply to this model you 've got here <unk>
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 969.47 974.26 <NA> we 've thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 974.26 979.73 <NA> <unk> that 's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor again to use that same word in medicine today
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 979.99 989.75 <NA> <unk> we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine but of course the genome is just the bottom of a long chain of being as it were <unk> 
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 990.1 1000.11 <NA> that chain of being really the first organized unit of that is the cell so if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1000.25 1001.7 <NA> <unk> and then personalizing
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1001.7 1016.41 <NA> organ or organismal therapies and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for for the environment so i think at every stage <unk> you know there 's that metaphor <unk> there 's turtles all the way <unk> well in this there 's personalization all the way ca so when you say
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1015.99 1020 <NA> medicine could be a cell and not a pill
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1019.75 1027.47 <NA> you 're talking about potentially your own cells sm absolutely ca so converted to stem cells perhaps tested against all kinds of
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1027.1 1028.68 <NA> drugs or something and
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1029.96 1034.38 <NA> <unk> 's no perhaps this is what we 're doing this is what 's happening and in fact <unk> 
SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1 SiddharthaMukherjee_2015 1033.98 1040.69 <NA> we 're slowly moving not away from genomics <unk> but incorporating genomics into what we call
