TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 13.08 14.87 <NA> is james risen 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 14.65 19.46 <NA> you may know him as the pulitzer prize winning reporter for the new york times <unk> 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 19.15 25.29 <NA> long before anybody knew edward snowden 's name risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 25.91 29.43 <NA> <unk> was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of americans 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 29.33 39.22 <NA> but it 's another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact in it he describes a catastrophic us intelligence operation
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 38.74 48.12 <NA> in which the cia quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to iran if that sounds crazy go read it it 's an incredible story <unk> 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 47.93 54.46 <NA> but you know who didn 't like that chapter the us government for nearly a decade afterwards
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 54.75 62.68 <NA> <unk> risen was the subject of a us government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 62.31 70.15 <NA> and along the way he became the face for the us government 's recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 70.23 75.02 <NA> you see under the first amendment the press has the right to publish secret information in the public
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 75.94 85.73 <NA> <unk> but it 's impossible to exercise that right if the media can 't also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them <unk> 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 85.57 92.4 <NA> so when the government came knocking risen did what many brave reporters have done before him he refused
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 91.98 94.19 <NA> and said he 'd rather go to jail 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 94.12 100.64 <NA> so from two thousand and seven to two thousand and fifteen risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 100.48 104.73 <NA> that is until just days before the trial when a curious thing happened
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 105.41 112.71 <NA> suddenly after years of claiming it was vital to their case the government dropped their demands to risen altogether 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 112.4 118.71 <NA> it turns out in the age of electronic surveillance <unk> there are very few places reporters and sources can hide 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 118.46 124.9 <NA> and instead of trying and failing to have risen testify they could have his digital trail testify against him
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 126.54 131.74 <NA> <unk> so completely in secret and without his consent prosecutors got risen 's phone records 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 131.37 133.87 <NA> they got his email records 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 133.41 141.22 <NA> his financial and banking information his credit reports even travel records with a list of flights he had taken

TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 150.82 152.69 <NA> <unk> this is only one case of many 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 152.62 156.62 <NA> president obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 156.28 162.89 <NA> and instead his justice department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined now 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 162.67 170.09 <NA> you can see how this could be a problem <unk> especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 170.26 179.91 <NA> since nine eleven <unk> virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist so we risk seeing the
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 179.84 186.78 <NA> <unk> press unable to do their job that the first amendment is supposed to protect because of the government 's expanded ability to spy on everyone <unk> 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 186.98 192.36 <NA> but just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent reporters ' rights 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 192.17 197.55 <NA> the press can also use technology to protect their sources even better than before 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 197.18 203.05 <NA> and they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them <unk> rather than on the witness stand after the fact
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 204.84 209.65 <NA> <unk> software now exists that wasn 't available when risen was writing his book and is much more <unk>
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 210.74 213.16 <NA> than regular emails or phone calls 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 213.3 217.81 <NA> for example one such tool is securedrop

TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 229.27 235.85 <NA> instead of sending an email <unk> you go to a news organization 's website like this one here on the washington post 
TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 235.48 242.66 <NA> from there you can upload a document or send information much like you would on any other contact form

TrevorTimm_2016U 1 TrevorTimm_2016U 247.84 254.91 <NA> so the government can no longer secretly demand the information and much of the information they would demand wouldn 't be available in the first
