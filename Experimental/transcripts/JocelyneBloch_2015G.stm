JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 15.28 21.62 <NA> and like most of my colleagues i have to deal <unk> every day with human tragedies 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 22.06 27.29 <NA> i realize how your life can change from one second to the other
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 26.83 29.39 <NA> after a major stroke
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 28.97 29.97 <NA> or after
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 30.08 35.52 <NA> <unk> a car accident <unk> and what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 35.3 37.71 <NA> is to realize that
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 37.49 44.28 <NA> unlike other organs of the body <unk> the brain has very little ability for self repair 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 44.69 53.92 <NA> and after a major injury of your central nervous system the patients often remain with a severe handicap
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 55.17 60.4 <NA> <unk> and that 's probably the reason why i 've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 60.63 68.3 <NA> what is a functional neurosurgeon <unk> it 's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 67.97 70.75 <NA> through different surgical strategies 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 71.55 79.97 <NA> you 've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation where you implant an electrode in the depths
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 80.02 81.14 <NA> <unk> of the brain
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 80.94 87.08 <NA> in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 86.85 89.27 <NA> it 's really an amazing technology
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 89.27 97.94 <NA> in that it has improved the destiny of patients with parkinson 's disease with severe tremor with severe pain <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 98.38 99.72 <NA> however <unk>
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 105.29 109.56 <NA> <unk> and the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 110.69 116.31 <NA> i think that we are approaching this dream and i would like to show you
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 116.69 125.02 <NA> that we are very close to this <unk> and that with a little bit of help the brain is able
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 125.02 129.97 <NA> to help itself <unk> so the story started fifteen
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 129.9 131.05 <NA> <unk> years ago 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 130.62 136.54 <NA> at that time i was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 136.11 140.2 <NA> i often had to take care of patients with head trauma <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 140.67 147.52 <NA> you have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma his brain is swelling
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 147.45 150.26 <NA> and he 's increasing his intracranial
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 151.69 158.97 <NA> <unk> and in order to save his life you have to decrease this intracranial pressure and to do that you sometimes have
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 158.79 162.14 <NA> to remove a piece of swollen brain <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 162.07 168.74 <NA> so instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain we decided with <unk>
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 168.31 172.4 <NA> <unk> jean franois brunet <unk> who is a colleague of mine a biologist to study them 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 172.84 178.8 <NA> what do i mean by that we wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 180.41 182.28 <NA> <unk> it 's not an easy task <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 182.09 190.26 <NA> growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 191.12 198.82 <NA> so you need to find the right nutrients <unk> the warmth the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 198.82 202.38 <NA> so that 's exactly what we had to do with these cells <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 201.95 204.25 <NA> and after many attempts
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 204.99 210.91 <NA> <unk> jean franois did it <unk> and that 's what he saw under his microscope <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 211.17 220.15 <NA> and that was for us a major surprise why because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 219.96 224.72 <NA> with large green cells surrounding small 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 227.11 230.21 <NA> <unk> and you may remember from biology class
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 230.01 238.04 <NA> that stem cells are immature cells <unk> able to turn into any type of cell of the body <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 238.93 250.05 <NA> the adult brain has stem cells but they 're very rare and they 're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 250.4 258.04 <NA> <unk> so it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 258.04 261.03 <NA> and there was another intriguing observation 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 261.38 270.24 <NA> regular stem cells are very active cells cells that divide divide divide very quickly 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 269.93 273.06 <NA> and they never die they 're immortal cells 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 272.9 274.84 <NA> but these cells behave
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 276.66 282.67 <NA> <unk> they divide slowly <unk> and after a few weeks of culture they even died <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 282.81 288.65 <NA> so we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 288.32 296.77 <NA> but behaved differently <unk> and it took us a long time to understand where they came from they come from
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 296.77 300.92 <NA> these cells <unk> these blue and red cells are called
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 305.05 307.1 <NA> <unk> have them in your brain <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 306.82 311.72 <NA> they represent four percent of your cortical brain cells <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 311.38 318.11 <NA> they have a very important role during the development stage when you were fetuses <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 317.98 321.47 <NA> they helped your brain to fold itself 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 321.64 329.79 <NA> but why do they stay in your head this we don 't know <unk> we think that they may participate
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 329.84 332.43 <NA> <unk> brain repair because we find them in
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 331.97 337.23 <NA> higher concentration close to brain lesions but it 's not so sure 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 337.34 344.4 <NA> but there is one clear thing that from these cells <unk> we got our stem cell culture <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 344.87 349.74 <NA> and we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 349.49 354.57 <NA> and we had to prove this so to prove it <unk> we decided to design
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 354.78 365.05 <NA> <unk> experimental paradigm <unk> the idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a <unk> non eloquent area of the brain <unk> and then to culture the cells exactly the <unk>
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 364.95 373.12 <NA> <unk> way jean franois did it in his lab <unk> and then label them to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 380.08 389.15 <NA> <unk> autologous grafts autografts so the first question we had what will happen if we re implant these cells in a normal brain 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 389.15 394.95 <NA> and what will happen if we re implant the same cells in a lesioned brain thanks to the help
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 394.74 399.9 <NA> of professor eric rouiller we worked with monkeys so in the
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 402.77 405.06 <NA> <unk> the cells in the normal brain
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 404.9 411.3 <NA> and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks as if
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 411.13 419.16 <NA> they were taken from the brain <unk> they go back home the space is already busy they are not needed there so they disappear 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 419.24 424.87 <NA> in the second case scenario <unk> we performed the lesion we re implanted exactly the same
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 426.18 430.02 <NA> <unk> and in this case <unk> the cells remained
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 429.8 433.58 <NA> and they became mature neurons <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 433.58 440.41 <NA> and that 's the image of what we could observe under the microscope <unk> those are the cells that were re implanted 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 440.31 449.11 <NA> and the proof they carry these little spots <unk> those are the cells that we 've labeled in vitro when they were in culture <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 450 452.36 <NA> could not stop here of course 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 452.05 462.67 <NA> do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion <unk> so for that we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 462.68 465.69 <NA> they had to retrieve food pellets from a tray 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 465.5 467.57 <NA> they were very good at it 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 467.38 471.38 <NA> and when they had reached a plateau of performance 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 470.89 478.62 <NA> we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion <unk> so the monkeys were
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 479.9 481.59 <NA> <unk> move their hand anymore 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 481.64 485.43 <NA> and exactly the same as humans would do 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 485.24 497.46 <NA> they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent exactly the same as after a stroke patients are completely <unk> plegic and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 497.46 500.02 <NA> they recover to a certain extent exactly the same for
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 501.15 510.07 <NA> <unk> so when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery <unk> we implanted his own cells <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 509.73 516.25 <NA> so on the left side you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered he
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 516.93 525.32 <NA> 's at about forty to fifty percent of his previous performance before the lesion he 's not so accurate
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 547.33 549.87 <NA> <unk> i tell you since that
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 550.61 557.92 <NA> <unk> we 've understood much more about these cells <unk> we know that we can cryopreserve them we can use them later on <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 557.92 567.6 <NA> we know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models like parkinson 's disease for example but our dream is still to implant them in humans 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 567.95 570.1 <NA> and i really hope
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 569.87 572.58 <NA> that i 'll be able to show you soon
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 573.14 574.9 <NA> that the human
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 589.71 598.27 <NA> <unk> sure that right now there are several dozen people in the audience possibly even a majority who are thinking i know somebody who can use this i do in any
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 598.86 604.85 <NA> case and of course the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 604.81 611.66 <NA> <unk> human clinical trials jocelyne bloch the biggest obstacles are regulations 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 612.61 624.9 <NA> so from these exciting results you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials bg which is understandable the brain is delicate etc jb 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 625.91 631.41 <NA> <unk> but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it you know <unk>
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 630.92 636.93 <NA> bg if you project yourself having done the research and having tried to get permission
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 637.01 642.51 <NA> to start the trials if you project yourself yourself out in time 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 642.23 649.32 <NA> how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available jb 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 648.98 654.28 <NA> so it 's very difficult to say it depends first on the approval of
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 654.99 658.58 <NA> <unk> trial will the regulation allow us to do it soon <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 658.37 664.26 <NA> and then you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients <unk> 
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 664.27 671.03 <NA> so it takes already a long time to select the patients do the the treatment and evaluate if it 's
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 670.85 674.65 <NA> useful to do this kind of treatment and then you have to
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 674.16 679.97 <NA> deploy this to a multicentric trial you have to really prove first
JocelyneBloch_2015G 1 JocelyneBloch_2015G 679.69 688.38 <NA> <unk> first that it 's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody bg and safe of course jb of course bg jocelyne thank you for coming to ted and sharing this
