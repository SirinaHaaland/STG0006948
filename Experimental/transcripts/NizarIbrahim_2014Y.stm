NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 18.94 23.27 <NA> <unk> they 're beautiful <unk> and there 's very little we know about them 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 23.17 29.28 <NA> these thoughts were going through my head when i looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 30.35 32.67 <NA> <unk> i was about five years old at the time 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 32.42 37.59 <NA> and i decided there and then that i would become a paleontologist <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 37.16 45.18 <NA> paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far flung corners of the world 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 45.23 49.9 <NA> and now a few years later i 've led several expeditions to the ultimate
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 51.18 60.13 <NA> <unk> on this planet the sahara i 've worked in the sahara because i 've been on a quest to uncover new remains
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 59.76 69.45 <NA> of a bizarre giant predatory dinosaur called spinosaurus a few bones of this animal have been found
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 69.45 74.54 <NA> in the deserts of egypt and were described about one hundred years ago by a german
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 78.67 82.88 <NA> <unk> bones were destroyed in world war ii so all we 're left with
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 82.65 85.67 <NA> are just a few drawings and notes 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 85.33 90.25 <NA> from these drawings we know that this creature <unk> which lived about one hundred million years ago 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 90.25 95.75 <NA> was very big it had tall spines on its back forming a magnificent sail <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 95.59 99.87 <NA> and it had long slender jaws a bit like a crocodile
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 104.06 113.91 <NA> <unk> that may have been used to catch slippery prey like fish <unk> but that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next one hundred years 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 118.25 123.09 <NA> my fieldwork took me to the border region between morocco and algeria 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 122.99 129.97 <NA> a place called the kem kem it 's a difficult place to work in you have to deal with sandstorms and snakes
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 130.11 131.62 <NA> <unk> and scorpions <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 131.28 137.56 <NA> and it 's very difficult to find good fossils there but our hard work paid off <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 137.19 144.49 <NA> we discovered many incredible specimens there 's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the sahara <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 144.69 149.93 <NA> we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs medium sized predatory
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 156.91 164.78 <NA> <unk> these fossils were deposited in a river system the river system was also home to a giant car sized coelacanth 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 165.1 170.73 <NA> a monster sawfish and the skies over the river system were filled
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 170.56 177.96 <NA> with pterosaurs <unk> flying reptiles it was a pretty dangerous place not the kind of place where you 'd want to travel to if you had a time machine
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 180.05 185.52 <NA> <unk> so we 're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside spinosaurus 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 185.06 194.7 <NA> but spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive we were just finding bits and pieces and i was hoping that we 'd find a partial skeleton at some point 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 194.93 203.47 <NA> finally very recently we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 205.5 212.45 <NA> <unk> we returned to the site we collected more bones and so after one hundred years we finally had another partial skeleton
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 212.24 214.39 <NA> of this bizarre creature 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 214.02 219.49 <NA> and we were able to reconstruct it we now know that spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 219.49 223.78 <NA> very different from other predatory dinosaurs very different from the t rex <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 224.13 228.43 <NA> but the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 230.04 236.13 <NA> spines the spines forming the big sail <unk> we had leg bones <unk> we had skull bones
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 237.69 241.97 <NA> feet wide feet again very unusual no other dinosaur has feet like this
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 241.8 247.64 <NA> and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment or maybe for paddling in the water <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 247.27 254.97 <NA> we also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone the inside structure of spinosaurus bones and it turns out that they 're very dense
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 254.96 262.62 <NA> <unk> and compact again this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water <unk> it 's useful for buoyancy control in the water <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 262.46 268.35 <NA> we <unk> c t scanned all of our bones and built a digital spinosaurus skeleton <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 268.34 274.77 <NA> and when we looked at the digital skeleton <unk> we realized that yes this was a dinosaur unlike any other it
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 278.19 284.86 <NA> <unk> written all over it but really the entire skeleton has water loving written all over it dense bone
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 284.4 293.83 <NA> paddle like feet <unk> and the hind limbs are reduced in size and again this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 294 304.97 <NA> so as we fleshed out our spinosaurus i 'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin we realize that we 're dealing with a river monster
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 304.72 314.75 <NA> <unk> monster a predatory dinosaur bigger than t rex the ruler of this ancient river of giants <unk> feeding on the many aquatic animals i showed you earlier on 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 314.32 320.63 <NA> so that 's really what makes this an incredible discovery it 's a dinosaur like no other <unk> and some people told me wow this is
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 320.2 324.87 <NA> a once in a lifetime discovery there are not many things left to discover in the
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 327.29 329.61 <NA> <unk> i think nothing could be further from the truth <unk> 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 329.66 339.24 <NA> i think the sahara 's still full of treasures <unk> and when people tell me there are no places left to explore i like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter roy chapman andrews 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 338.78 340.62 <NA> and he said 
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 340.52 344.86 <NA> always <unk> there has been an adventure just around the corner
NizarIbrahim_2014Y 1 NizarIbrahim_2014Y 344.63 354.31 <NA> and the world is still full of corners that was true many decades ago when roy chapman andrews wrote these lines <unk> and it is still true today <unk> thank you
