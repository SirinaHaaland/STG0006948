CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 20.2 25.17 <NA> he did it because he couldn 't afford a car <unk> but also because he knew how to build
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 26.24 37.17 <NA> <unk> a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made so we could build and repair them or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 37.34 43.41 <NA> many of these do it yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 42.95 51.73 <NA> but now the maker community and <unk> the open source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they 're made of
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 51.54 54.94 <NA> back into our lives and i believe we need to take them
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 54.9 59.11 <NA> <unk> to the next level to the components things are made of 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 58.8 66.82 <NA> for the most part we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 66.39 79.43 <NA> but now we have these amazing <unk> futuristic composites plastics that change shape <unk> paints that conduct electricity pigments that change color fabrics that light up
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 80.02 82.22 <NA> <unk> me show you some examples
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 85.96 92.21 <NA> so conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 91.78 103.49 <NA> printed circuit boards or wires in the case of this little example i 'm holding we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 103.3 104.97 <NA> conductive ink has
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 104.93 113.22 <NA> <unk> been used by artists <unk> but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 113.9 123.9 <NA> and this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light diffusing particles what this means is that while regular acrylic only diffuses light around <unk>
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 123.8 129.91 <NA> <unk> the edges this one illuminates across the entire surface when i turn on the lights around it
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 130.16 137.2 <NA> two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi touch systems <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 137.82 142.64 <NA> and thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 142.64 149.39 <NA> so i 'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 149.21 151.37 <NA> and you can see what happens
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 155.05 165.17 <NA> <unk> one of the principle applications for this material is amongst other things in baby bottles <unk> so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 165.79 177.23 <NA> so these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials in a few years they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 176.77 179.88 <NA> we may not yet have the flying cars science

CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 191.54 198.51 <NA> so i 'm a social scientist by training so why am i here today talking about smart materials <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 198.11 204.67 <NA> well first of all because i am a maker i 'm curious about how things work and how they are made
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 205.05 211.16 <NA> <unk> but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 211.16 217.3 <NA> and right now we don 't know enough about these high tech composites our future will be made of 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 216.9 224.98 <NA> smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities <unk> there 's barely any information available on how to use them <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 224.73 229.97 <NA> and very little is said about how they are produced <unk> so for now they exist
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 230.16 232.34 <NA> mostly in this realm of
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 232 238.1 <NA> trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 237.79 244.34 <NA> so a little over three years ago kirsty boyle and i started a project we called open materials 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 244.34 250.11 <NA> it 's a website where we and anyone else who wants to join us share experiments
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 250.07 255.12 <NA> <unk> publish information encourage others to contribute whenever they can 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 255.11 262.38 <NA> and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 262.19 271.53 <NA> we would like it to become a large collectively generated database of do it yourself information on smart materials <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 271.64 279.97 <NA> but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of first of all because we can 't shape
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 279.75 286.01 <NA> <unk> shape what we don 't understand and what we don 't understand and use ends up shaping us 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 285.77 296.2 <NA> the objects we use the clothes we wear the houses we live in all have a profound impact on our behavior health and quality of life <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 296.19 302.59 <NA> so if we are to live in a world made of smart materials we should know and understand them <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 302.4 304.94 <NA> secondly and just as important
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 304.98 315.23 <NA> innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers <unk> so many times amateurs not experts have been the inventors and improvers of things <unk>
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 315.13 322.34 <NA> <unk> ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors <unk> personal computers airplanes 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 329.99 340.2 <NA> <unk> always the case <unk> two scientists at university of illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 339.77 350.14 <NA> jordan bunker <unk> who had had no experience with chemistry until then <unk> read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 352.47 362.56 <NA> <unk> and tools he used a toaster oven <unk> and he even made his own vortex mixer based on a tutorial by another scientist <unk> maker 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 362.13 371.86 <NA> jordan then published his results online <unk> including all the things he had tried and didn 't work <unk> so others could study and reproduce it <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 371.58 379.7 <NA> so jordan 's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well equipped lab at the university
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 379.93 387.08 <NA> <unk> and recreate it in a garage in chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 386.77 395.78 <NA> and now that he published this work <unk> others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 395.59 398.91 <NA> another example i 'd like to mention is hannah
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 405.37 411.69 <NA> qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 411.95 417.12 <NA> electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 416.89 422.22 <NA> but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 422.22 429.97 <NA> so hannah 's approach on the other hand is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 429.6 436.69 <NA> <unk> objects that free us from pre designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 436.35 441.73 <NA> so amongst hannah 's many impressive experiments this is one of my favorites [ paper speakers ]
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 444.93 449.9 <NA> what we 're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 465.13 477.95 <NA> <unk> so based on the research by marcelo coelho from mit hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 477.85 479.91 <NA> just like jordan and so
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 479.84 486.66 <NA> <unk> many other makers hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 487.55 496.95 <NA> but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 496.95 504.76 <NA> so hannah 's artisanal work and the fact that she shared her findings opens the doors to a series of new
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 504.72 506.77 <NA> <unk> possibilities that are both
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 506.6 510.22 <NA> aesthetically appealing and innovative <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 510.66 519.11 <NA> so the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity <unk> and we are not afraid to fail 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 518.87 528.47 <NA> we often tackle problems from unconventional angles and in the process end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 528.47 529.94 <NA> so the more people
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 529.9 535.73 <NA> <unk> experiment with materials the more researchers are willing to share their research
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 535.73 543.17 <NA> and manufacturers their knowledge the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 543.4 548.22 <NA> so i feel a bit as ted nelson must have when in the early
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 555.07 561.92 <NA> large mainframes only scientists cared about and no one dreamed of even having one at home <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 561.93 568.06 <NA> so it 's a little strange that i 'm standing here and saying you must understand smart materials now 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 567.87 578.22 <NA> just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future <unk> 
CatarinaMota_2012G 1 CatarinaMota_2012G 577.85 578.98 <NA> thank you
