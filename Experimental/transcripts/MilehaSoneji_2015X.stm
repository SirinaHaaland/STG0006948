MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 12.79 18.2 <NA> <unk> in india we have these huge families i bet a lot of you all must have heard about it 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 17.95 25.11 <NA> which means that there are a lot of family events <unk> so as a child <unk> my parents used to drag me to these family
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 26.3 29.22 <NA> <unk> but the one thing that i always looked forward to
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 29.05 31.86 <NA> was playing around with my cousins 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 31.7 42.33 <NA> and there was always this one uncle who used to be there always ready jumping around with us <unk> having games for us <unk> making us kids have the time of our lives 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 42.44 47.76 <NA> this man was extremely successful <unk> he was confident and powerful <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 47.42 52.62 <NA> but then i saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 52.73 54.97 <NA> he was diagnosed with parkinson
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 56.25 60.76 <NA> parkinson 's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 60.3 69.37 <NA> which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee because of tremors much more difficult 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 69.27 78.89 <NA> my uncle started using a walker to walk and to take a turn he literally had to take one step at a time like this and it took forever
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 80.2 87.86 <NA> <unk> so this person who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering was suddenly hiding behind people 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 87.88 94.79 <NA> he was hiding from the pitiful look in people 's eyes <unk> and he 's not the only one in the world 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 94.78 99.96 <NA> every year <unk> sixty thousand people are newly diagnosed with parkinson
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 100.76 103.11 <NA> <unk> and this number is only rising 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 103.88 112.5 <NA> as designers we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems one solution that solves it all 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 112.13 115.2 <NA> but it need not always be like that 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 115.16 124.96 <NA> you can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact <unk> so my aim here was to not
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 126.48 131.5 <NA> <unk> but to make their everyday tasks much more simple and then make an impact 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 131.55 136.09 <NA> well the first thing i targeted was tremors right <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 135.93 142.78 <NA> my uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 142.53 146.95 <NA> so <unk> well i designed the no spill cup 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 146.58 154.79 <NA> it works just purely on its form the curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 154.83 158.48 <NA> and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 158.29 164.03 <NA> but the key here is that it is not tagged as a parkinson 's patient product 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 163.54 168.35 <NA> it looks like a cup that could be used by you me any clumsy person 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 167.98 172.76 <NA> and that makes it much more comforting for them to use to blend in 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 173.41 175.11 <NA> so well one
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 176.54 178.14 <NA> <unk> many more to go 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 178.16 182.43 <NA> all this while i was interviewing him <unk> questioning him <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 182.12 189 <NA> and then i realized that i was getting very superficial information or just answers to my questions <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 188.63 192.72 <NA> but i really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 192.5 199.32 <NA> so i thought <unk> well <unk> let 's observe him in his daily tasks while he 's eating while he 's watching tv <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 199.34 204.67 <NA> and then when i was actually observing him walking to his dining table it struck me
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 205.11 211.27 <NA> <unk> this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land how does he climb a staircase 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 210.81 219.61 <NA> because in india we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries one actually has to climb the stairs <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 219.42 224.96 <NA> so he told me well <unk> let me show you how i do it let 's take a look at what
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 228.91 239.51 <NA> <unk> so he took really long to reach this position <unk> and then all this while i 'm thinking oh my god is he really going to do it is he really really going to do it without his walker and then 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 248.17 249.99 <NA> and the turns he took them so
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 255.53 257.07 <NA> <unk> i was too <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 258.83 264.78 <NA> so this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 265.19 269.97 <NA> on researching this i realized that it 's because it 's a continuous motion
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 269.48 279.7 <NA> there 's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker <unk> but the moment he 's put on a cycle all his symptoms vanish because it is a
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 279.66 287.62 <NA> <unk> continuous motion <unk> so the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 287.4 294.05 <NA> and a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him <unk> but the one that finally worked was this one let 's take a look
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 311.2 314.87 <NA> <unk> i call this the staircase illusion <unk> and
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 314.53 318.62 <NA> actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended he froze <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 318.13 328.4 <NA> and this is called freezing of gait <unk> so it happens a lot so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms making them feel much more confident 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 329.66 331.77 <NA> <unk> technology is not always it
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 331.77 342.27 <NA> what we need are human centered solutions <unk> i could have easily made it into a projection or a google glass <unk> or something like that but i stuck to simple print on the floor 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 341.84 348.06 <NA> this print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 348.08 354.88 <NA> what i wish to do is make every parkinson 's patient feel like my uncle felt that day he told me
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 354.87 358.24 <NA> <unk> that i made him feel like his old self again 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 358.62 363.52 <NA> smart in today 's world has become synonymous to high tech <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 363.48 371.77 <NA> and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day <unk> but why can 't smart be something that 's simple and yet effective 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 371.85 379.94 <NA> all we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity to go out there observe <unk> but let 's not stop at that
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 380.01 384.17 <NA> let 's find these complex problems don 't be scared of them <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 383.68 390.26 <NA> break them boil them down into much smaller problems and then find simple solutions for them <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 389.83 395.9 <NA> test these solutions <unk> <unk> fail if needed <unk> but with newer insights to make it better <unk> 
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 395.74 403.83 <NA> imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions <unk> what would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions
MilehaSoneji_2015X 1 MilehaSoneji_2015X 404.84 407.35 <NA> <unk> let 's make a smarter world but with simplicity
