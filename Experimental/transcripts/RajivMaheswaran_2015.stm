RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 12.79 16.88 <NA> <unk> my colleagues and i are fascinated by the science of moving dots <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 16.88 26.94 <NA> so what are these dots <unk> well it 's all of us and we 're moving in our homes in our offices <unk> as we shop and travel throughout our cities and around the world 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 26.7 29.94 <NA> and wouldn 't it be great if we could understand all
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 29.9 34.23 <NA> <unk> this movement if we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 33.77 47.73 <NA> and luckily for us we live in a time where we 're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves <unk> so whether it 's through sensors or videos <unk> or apps <unk> we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 47.57 53.23 <NA> so it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 53.01 54.01 <NA> is sports
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 54.87 65.5 <NA> <unk> whether it 's basketball or baseball or football or the other football we 're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements every fraction of a second <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 65.5 67.3 <NA> so what we 're doing
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 66.99 70.06 <NA> is turning our athletes into
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 69.9 79.88 <NA> you probably guessed it moving dots <unk> so we 've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data <unk> it 's hard to deal with and
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 80.02 81.14 <NA> <unk> that interesting 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 80.92 84.9 <NA> but there are things that for example basketball coaches want to know 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 84.9 93.5 <NA> and the problem is they can 't know them because they 'd have to watch every second of every game remember it and process it and a person can 't do that 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 93.31 99.99 <NA> but a machine can the problem is a machine can 't see the game with the eye of a coach at least they
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 102.47 104.67 <NA> <unk> what have we taught the machine to see <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 105.08 113.55 <NA> so we started simply we taught it things like passes shots and rebounds things that most casual fans would know 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 113.27 119.17 <NA> and then we moved on to things slightly more complicated <unk> events like post ups and
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 121.03 124.54 <NA> and if you don 't know them that 's okay most casual players probably do
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 125.88 128.29 <NA> <unk> we 've gotten to a point where today <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 127.98 136.54 <NA> the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins <unk> basically things only professionals know <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 136.54 138.83 <NA> so we have taught a machine
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 138.35 139.82 <NA> to see
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 139.64 141.73 <NA> with the eyes of a coach <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 141.45 149.96 <NA> so how have we been able to do this if i asked a coach to describe something like a pick and roll they would give me a description and if i encoded that as
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 153.76 156.15 <NA> <unk> happens to be this dance in basketball
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 155.91 166.61 <NA> between four players two on offense and two on defense <unk> and here 's kind of how it goes <unk> so there 's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball <unk>
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 166.56 171.23 <NA> and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens and ta da it 's a pick and roll 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 173.2 179.01 <NA> so that is also an example of a terrible algorithm <unk> so if the player who 's the
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 179.93 181.38 <NA> <unk> called the screener
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 181.07 186.06 <NA> goes close by but he doesn 't stop <unk> it 's probably not a pick and roll 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 186.05 192.36 <NA> or if he does stop but he doesn 't stop close enough <unk> it 's probably not a pick and roll 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 192.14 199.99 <NA> or if he does go close by and he does stop but they do it under the basket <unk> it 's probably not a pick and roll or i could be
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 201.69 208.3 <NA> <unk> really depends on the exact timing the distances the locations <unk> and that 's what makes it hard 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 208.11 215.23 <NA> so luckily with machine learning we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 214.8 220.82 <NA> so how does this work well it 's by example <unk> so we go to the machine and say good morning machine 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 220.82 225.02 <NA> here are some pick and rolls and here are some things that are not <unk> please
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 225 226.88 <NA> find a way to tell the difference 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 226.54 235.86 <NA> and the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate so if i was going to teach it the difference between an apple and and orange i might say why don 't you use color or shape 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 235.65 244.14 <NA> and the problem that we 're solving is what are those things what are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 244.14 250.2 <NA> so figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location distance timing
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 251.42 255.51 <NA> <unk> that 's really the key to the science of moving dots or
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 255.02 263.07 <NA> as we like to call it spatiotemporal pattern recognition in academic vernacular because the first thing is you have to make it sound hard
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 262.76 264.17 <NA> because it is 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 264.17 273.31 <NA> the key thing is for nba coaches it 's not that they want to know whether a pick and roll happened or not it 's that they want to know how it happened and why is it so important to them 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 273.07 274.96 <NA> so here 's a little insight it turns out
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 277.08 278.82 <NA> <unk> is perhaps the most important play 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 278.63 289 <NA> and knowing how to run it and knowing how to defend it is basically a key to winning and losing most games <unk> so it turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying <unk>
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 288.9 294.08 <NA> <unk> the variations is really the thing that matters <unk> and that 's why we need this to be really really good 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 304.87 305.93 <NA> <unk> either roll
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 305.93 319.76 <NA> or pop the guy guarding the ball can either go over or under <unk> his teammate can either show or play up to touch or play soft and together they can either switch or blitz and i didn 't know most of these things when i started
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 319.54 324.75 <NA> and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows it would make our lives a lot
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 325.52 329.28 <NA> <unk> but it turns out movement is very very messy people wiggle a lot
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 328.88 339.93 <NA> and getting these variations identified with very very high accuracy both in precision and recall is tough because that 's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 339.59 349.53 <NA> and despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 349.04 354.97 <NA> we 're at the point where almost every single contender for an nba championship this year is
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 354.96 362.92 <NA> <unk> using our software <unk> which is built on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball so
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 362.49 368.5 <NA> not only that we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 368.3 377.02 <NA> win very important games <unk> and it 's very exciting because you have coaches who 've been in the league for thirty years that are willing to take advice from a machine 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 377.37 379.85 <NA> and it 's very exciting it 's much more than the
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 380.1 387.71 <NA> our computer started out with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things frankly i don 't understand
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 387.76 393.38 <NA> much of what it does and while it 's not that special to to be smarter than me <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 392.89 399.81 <NA> we were wondering can a machine know more than a coach can it know more than person could know and it turns out the answer is
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 400.7 410.91 <NA> <unk> coaches want players to take good shots <unk> so if i 'm standing near the basket and there 's nobody near me it 's a good shot if i 'm standing far away surrounded by defenders that 's generally a bad shot <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 410.91 417.54 <NA> but we never knew how good good was or how bad bad was quantitatively until now <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 417.23 425.2 <NA> so what we can do again using spatiotemporal features we looked at every shot <unk> we can see where is the shot what 's the angle to the basket
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 425.49 432.38 <NA> <unk> the defenders standing what are their distances what are their angles for multiple defenders <unk> we can look at how the player 's moving and
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 432.2 442.02 <NA> predict the shot type <unk> we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances <unk>
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 442.02 443.98 <NA> so why is this important <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 443.55 445.61 <NA> we can take something
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 445.45 454.94 <NA> that was shooting <unk> which was one thing before <unk> and turn it into two things the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter <unk> so here 's a bubble chart because
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 454.95 457.31 <NA> what 's what 's ted without a bubble chart laughter
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 457.39 468.71 <NA> those are nba players the size is the size of the player and the color is the position on the x axis we have the shot probability <unk> people on the left take difficult shots on the right they take easy shots
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 469.08 479.34 <NA> on the [ y axis ] is their shooting ability <unk> people who are good are at the top bad at the bottom so for example <unk> if there was a player who generally made forty seven percent of their shots that 's all you knew before <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 479.9 481.03 <NA> <unk> i can tell you
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 480.85 486.15 <NA> that player takes shots that an average nba player would make forty nine percent of the time 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 485.69 493.17 <NA> and they are two percent worse <unk> and the reason that 's important is that there are lots of 47s out there 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 493.34 504.97 <NA> and so it 's really important to know if the forty seven that you 're considering giving one hundred million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 504.93 506.23 <NA> <unk> good shots 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 506.64 512.35 <NA> machine understanding doesn 't just change how we look at players <unk> it changes how we look at the game <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 511.86 517.81 <NA> so there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago in the nba finals miami was down by three
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 517.81 524.84 <NA> there was twenty seconds left they were about to lose the championship a gentleman named lebron james came up and he took a three to tie he
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 525.46 536.78 <NA> <unk> his teammate chris bosh got a rebound <unk> passed it to another teammate named ray allen he sank a three <unk> it went into overtime they won the game they won the championship it was one of the most exciting games in basketball 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 536.92 545.85 <NA> and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 545.62 547.26 <NA> in a way
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 547.02 549.78 <NA> that we never could before now
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 550.34 559.47 <NA> <unk> i can 't show you that video but for you we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about three weeks ago 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 561.08 568.38 <NA> laughter and we recreated the tracking that led to the insights so here is us this is chinatown
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 568.38 574.87 <NA> in los angeles a park we play at every week and that 's us recreating the ray allen moment and all the tracking that 's
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 575 580.69 <NA> <unk> associated with it so here 's the shot i 'm going to show you that moment
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 580.52 583.23 <NA> and all the insights of that moment 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 583.23 591.79 <NA> the only difference is instead of the professional players <unk> it 's us <unk> and instead of a professional announcer <unk> it 's me <unk> so <unk> bear with me <unk> 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 592.65 597.67 <NA> miami down three twenty seconds left

RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 638.16 647.44 <NA> had about a nine percent chance of happening in the nba and we know that and a great many other things i 'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to to make that happen
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 655.47 657.88 <NA> <unk> the important thing about that video
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 657.68 666.91 <NA> and the insights we have for every second of every nba game it 's not that it 's the fact you don 't have to be a professional team to track movement 
RajivMaheswaran_2015 1 RajivMaheswaran_2015 666.48 674.5 <NA> you do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement in fact it doesn 't even have to be about sports because we 're moving everywhere
