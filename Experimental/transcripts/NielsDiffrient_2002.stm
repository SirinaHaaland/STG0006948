NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 493.76 499.84 <NA> <unk> when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 500.94 503.92 <NA> <unk> if you mean it <unk> you don 't start with
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 503.43 512.83 <NA> styling sketches i started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago <unk> and
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 512.63 519.28 <NA> the loose ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office at the

NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 538.33 546.06 <NA> so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 547.99 553.89 <NA> <unk> as mechanistically possible so that they didn 't have to fuss with it <unk> so my idea was that

NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 585.57 593.26 <NA> on my chair whether you 're five feet tall or six foot six it always
NielsDiffrient_2002 1 NielsDiffrient_2002 592.98 595.48 <NA> deals with your weight
