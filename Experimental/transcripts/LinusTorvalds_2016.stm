LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 948.41 954.88 <NA> <unk> it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case <unk> and that 's good code
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 954.89 961.36 <NA> but this is simple code this is cs one hundred and one this is not important although <unk> details are important 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 961.29 969.13 <NA> to me the sign of people i really want to work with is that they have good taste <unk> which is how 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 968.82 977.84 <NA> i sent you this stupid example that is not relevant because it 's too small good taste is much bigger than this good taste is about

LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 980.31 981.31 <NA> kind of
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 981.12 989.66 <NA> instinctively knowing what 's the right way to do things ca ok so we 're putting the pieces together here now <unk> <unk> you have taste 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 989.56 991.68 <NA> in a way that 's meaningful to software people
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1005.4 1008.33 <NA> <unk> but there must be something else i mean you 've changed the future you must have <unk>
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1009.61 1012.71 <NA> <unk> of these grand visions of the future you 're a visionary right lt i
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1012.55 1016.94 <NA> 've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at ted for the last two
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1016.78 1024.96 <NA> days because there 's a lot of vision going on right <unk> and i am not a visionary <unk> i do not have a five year plan <unk> i
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1025.94 1027.75 <NA> <unk> and i think it 's really i mean
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1027.58 1035.05 <NA> i 'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying i want to go there 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1035.05 1040.96 <NA> but i 'm looking at the ground and i want to fix the pothole that 's right in front of me before i fall in 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1040.74 1042.69 <NA> this is the kind of person i am ca so
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1045.14 1051.52 <NA> you spoke to me last week about about these two guys who are they and how do you relate to them
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1054.89 1065.51 <NA> clich in technology the whole tesla versus edison where tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man and people love tesla 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1065.51 1068.86 <NA> i mean there are people who name their companies after him 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1070.95 1077.96 <NA> the other person there is edison who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian and
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1079.81 1087.11 <NA> <unk> his most famous quote is genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1087.11 1093.92 <NA> and i 'm in the edison camp even if people don 't always like him because if you actually compare the two 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1093.61 1097.04 <NA> tesla has kind of this mind
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1096.91 1099.9 <NA> grab these days <unk> but who actually changed the
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1103.64 1112.62 <NA> <unk> may not have been a nice person he did a lot of things he he was maybe not so intellectual not so visionary
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1112.58 1113.97 <NA> but
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1113.87 1117.21 <NA> i think i 'm more of an edison than a tesla ca 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1117.14 1125.05 <NA> so our theme at ted this week is is dreams big bold audacious dreams you 're really the antidote to that lt i 'm trying to dial it down a bit
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1131.01 1137.32 <NA> <unk> companies like google and many others have made <unk> arguably like <unk> billions of dollars out of your software does that piss you off <unk> 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1136.86 1144.64 <NA> lt no no it doesn 't piss me off for several reasons and one of them is i 'm doing fine <unk> i 'm really doing fine
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1144.33 1154.49 <NA> <unk> but the other reason is i mean <unk> without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing linux would never have been what it is and
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1154.86 1162.86 <NA> it 's brought experiences i don 't really enjoy <unk> public talking but at the same time <unk> this is an experience trust me <unk> 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1162.73 1166.67 <NA> so there 's a lot of things going on that make me a
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1166.69 1178.56 <NA> very happy man and thinking i did the right choices ca is the open source idea this is i think we 'll end here is the open source idea fully realized now in the world
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1179.87 1186.58 <NA> <unk> more that it could go are there more things that it could do lt so i 'm of two minds there
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1186.58 1191.43 <NA> i think one reason open source works so well in in code
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1190.97 1192.57 <NA> is that
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1192.37 1197.99 <NA> at the end of the day code tends to be somewhat black and white there 's
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1197.99 1204.61 <NA> often a fairly good way to decide this is done correctly and this is not done well
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1204.98 1207.67 <NA> code either works or it doesn 't 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1207.18 1215.76 <NA> which means that there 's less room for arguments <unk> and we have arguments despite this right 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1215.76 1217.97 <NA> in many other areas
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1217.81 1229.13 <NA> i mean people have talked about open politics and things like that and it 's really hard sometimes to say that yes you can apply the same principles in some other areas just because
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1230.02 1236.33 <NA> <unk> the black and white turns into not just gray but different colors 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1235.84 1242.19 <NA> so obviously open source in science is making a comeback science was there first 
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1242.19 1249.96 <NA> but then science ended up being pretty closed with very expensive journals and some some of that going on and open source is
LinusTorvalds_2016 1 LinusTorvalds_2016 1261.44 1264.19 <NA> <unk> so there are other examples i 'm sure there are more to come
