KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 13.21 19.49 <NA> <unk> me just start with my story <unk> so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 19.49 28.19 <NA> then i went on to tear my acl the ligament in my knee <unk> and then developed an arthritic knee and i 'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 27.85 29.82 <NA> by the way i married a
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 30.05 35.68 <NA> <unk> who has exactly the same story <unk> so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 35.5 42.36 <NA> and to see if i couldn 't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 42.71 46.15 <NA> so with that let me just show you a quick video
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 45.96 54.76 <NA> to get you in the mood of what we 're trying to explain narrator we are all aware of the risk of cancer but there 's another disease that 's destined to affect even more of us
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 54.78 60.27 <NA> <unk> arthritis <unk> cancer may kill you but when you look at the numbers arthritis ruins more lives <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 60.28 73.09 <NA> assuming you live a long life there 's a fifty percent chance you 'll develop arthritis and it 's not just aging that causes arthritis <unk> common injuries can lead to decades of pain <unk> until our joints quite literally grind to a halt <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 72.69 74.75 <NA> desperate for a solution we 've turned to
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 75.25 79.09 <NA> <unk> to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 79.09 86.93 <NA> but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body <unk> shouldn 't we stop and ask if there 's a better more natural way 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 87.28 90.14 <NA> let 's consider an alternative path 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 90.13 99.9 <NA> what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature <unk> or within our own stem cells <unk> this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 102.44 110.26 <NA> <unk> and so the mission is how do i treat these things biologically and let 's talk about both what i did for my wife and what i 've done for hundreds of other patients
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 110.08 122.64 <NA> first thing for my wife and the most common thing i hear from my patients particularly in the 40 to 80 year old age group 70 year old age group is they come in and say hey doc isn 't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee i 'm not ready for joint replacement 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 122.21 126.88 <NA> and so for her i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 129.69 135.04 <NA> <unk> unstable ligament we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 134.55 148.45 <NA> and then for the damaged arthritis on the surface we did a stem cell paste graft which we designed in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 147.99 154.79 <NA> so here 's my wife 's bad knee on the left and her just hiking now four months later in aspen and doing well
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 154.96 162.69 <NA> <unk> and it works not just for my wife but certainly for other patients the girl on the video jen hudak just won the superpipe in aspen
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 162.45 172.31 <NA> just nine months after having destroyed her knee as you see in the other image and having a paste graft to that knee <unk> and so we can regrow these surfaces biologically <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 173.02 175.17 <NA> so with all this success
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 175.52 178.06 <NA> <unk> why isn 't that good enough you might ask 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 178.06 187.68 <NA> well the reason is because there 's not enough donor cycles there 's not enough young healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 187.52 196.41 <NA> and the tissue 's very expensive <unk> and so that 's not going to be a solution that 's going to get us global with biologic tissue <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 196.41 199.96 <NA> but the solution is animal tissue because it 's plentiful it 's
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 200.7 202.88 <NA> <unk> you can get it from young healthy tissues 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 202.88 216.58 <NA> but the barrier is immunology and the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl or gal epitope so if we 're going to transplant animal tissues to people we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 216.21 229.91 <NA> so my story in working with animal tissues starts in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and i started first with cow achilles tendon <unk> where we would take the cow achilles tendon <unk> which is type i collagen strip it of its antigens
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 229.84 235.71 <NA> <unk> by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 235.71 244.07 <NA> we would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient 's knee <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 243.64 248.43 <NA> we 've now done that procedure and it 's been done worldwide in over four thousand cases
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 255.14 261.52 <NA> <unk> the tissue <unk> but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament i can 't grind it up in a blender <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 261.31 271.92 <NA> so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri galili and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away or strip those galactosyl <unk>
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 271.87 279.52 <NA> epitopes with a specific enzyme and we call that a gal stripping technique what we do is humanize the tissue
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 279.98 287.08 <NA> 's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patient 's knee 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 288.54 299.99 <NA> and we 've done that now we 've taken pig ligament young healthy big tissue put it into ten patients in an fda approved trial and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 301.66 306.95 <NA> <unk> he calls it so we know it can work and there 's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 307.75 318.68 <NA> so what about the next step what about getting to a total biologic knee replacement not just the parts how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement <unk> well here 's how we 're going to do it <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 318.37 324.68 <NA> so what we 're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young healthy pig 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 324.37 329.85 <NA> strip it of its antigens load it with your stem cells
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 330.29 338.71 <NA> then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee <unk> tack it on there have you heal that surface
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 338.71 342.72 <NA> and then create a new biologic surface for your knee <unk> 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 344.18 350.05 <NA> so that 's our biologic approach right now we 're going to rebuild your knee with the parts
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 350 353.17 <NA> we 're going to resurface it with a completely new surface 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 352.97 363.4 <NA> but we have other advantages from the animal kingdom there 's a benefit of four hundred million years of ambulation <unk> we can harness those benefits <unk> we can use thicker <unk>
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 363.35 368.84 <NA> younger better tissues than you might have injured in your knee or that you might have when you 're forty fifty or sixty 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 379.93 383.84 <NA> <unk> super biologics it 's not hardware 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 383.56 390.83 <NA> it 's not software it 's bioware it 's version two point zero of you 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 391.45 393.8 <NA> and so with that coming to a 
KevinStone_2010U 1 KevinStone_2010U 394.96 399.39 <NA> coming to an operating theater near you soon i believe <unk> thank you very much
