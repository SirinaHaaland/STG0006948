NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 12.64 19.88 <NA> <unk> in this rather long sort of marathon presentation i 've tried to break it up into three parts <unk> the first being
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 19.54 29.91 <NA> a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 29.92 37.86 <NA> these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of <unk> if you will the intelligence of interaction 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 37.49 43.83 <NA> then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies new media
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 43.4 46.51 <NA> falling very much into that mold 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 46.51 53.92 <NA> again i will go through them as fast as possible and then the last one will be some examples i 've been able to collect <unk> which i think
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 56.09 65.59 <NA> <unk> illustrate this at least as best i can in the world of entertainment people have this this
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 65.43 69.49 <NA> belief and i share most of it that we will be
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 69.49 79.79 <NA> using the tv screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future but then you think my god what a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on tv
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 80.19 85.82 <NA> it doesn 't have to be terrible and that is a slide taken from a tv set
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 85.66 93.71 <NA> and it was pre processed to be very sympathetic to the tv medium and it absolutely looks beautiful well
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 93.55 97.82 <NA> what 's happened how did people
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 97.51 103.92 <NA> get into this mess <unk> where you are now all of a sudden <unk> sitting in front of personal computers and
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 104.9 110.13 <NA> <unk> video text teletext systems and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 110.12 118.02 <NA> well you have to remember that tv was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal <unk> so you get
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 119.96 125.17 <NA> <unk> whatever tv and then you should multiply that by eight and that 's the distance you should sit away from the tv
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 129.18 136.24 <NA> <unk> in front of a tv and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 136.01 140.86 <NA> all of a sudden are staring you in the face the shadow mask the scan lines all of that 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 140.86 147.59 <NA> and they can be treated very easily there are actually ways of getting rid of them there are actually ways of
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 147.38 154.97 <NA> of just making absolutely beautiful pictures <unk> i 'm talking here a little bit about display technologies
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 155.13 162.93 <NA> let me talk about how you might input information and my favorite example is always fingers i 'm very interested in
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 179.84 188.16 <NA> <unk> for for inputting to a display in fact they 're not it 's really a very very high resolution input medium you have to just do it twice you have to
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 188.16 193.42 <NA> touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly and you can move a cursor
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 193.23 202.83 <NA> with great accuracy and so when you see on the market these these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 202.43 204.94 <NA> it 's nice that they exist because it still
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 204.87 213.61 <NA> <unk> is better than nothing <unk> but it in some sense misses the point <unk> namely that fingers are a very very high resolution input medium now 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 213.63 216.98 <NA> what are some of the other advantages <unk> well
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 216.81 225.05 <NA> the one advantage is that you don 't have to pick them up and people don 't realize how important that is not having to pick up your
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 230.11 236.78 <NA> <unk> when you think for a second of the mouse on on macintosh and i will not criticize the mouse
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 236.59 240.21 <NA> too much when you 're typing
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 240.21 246.65 <NA> what you have you want to now put something first of all you 've got to find the mouse you have to probably stop
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 246.55 249.93 <NA> maybe not come to a grinding halt but you 've got to sort of find
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 250.46 256.03 <NA> <unk> then you find the mouse <unk> and you 're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 255.79 262.42 <NA> and then when you finally see where it is then you 've got to move it to get the cursor over there <unk> and then bang you 've got to hit a button or do whatever 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 262.42 270.03 <NA> that 's four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 269.78 274.41 <NA> all in one motion or one and a half depending on how you want to count 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 274.04 279.97 <NA> again <unk> what i 'm trying to do is just illustrate the kinds of problems that i think
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 280.01 286.33 <NA> face the designers of new computer systems and entertainment systems and educational systems
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 286.41 295.58 <NA> from the perspective of of the quality of that interface <unk> and another advantage of course of using fingers is you have ten of them <unk> and
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 295.58 300.16 <NA> we have never known how to do this technically so this slide is a fake slide 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 300 303.26 <NA> we never succeeded in using ten fingers <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 302.86 311.16 <NA> but there are certain things you can do obviously with more than one finger input <unk> which is is rather fascinating 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 310.98 318.49 <NA> what we did stumble across was something again <unk> which is typical of the computer field is when you have a bug
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 318.49 321.84 <NA> that you can 't get rid of you turn it into a feature and
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 321.63 323.06 <NA> maybe 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 325.31 330.66 <NA> <unk> a mouse is a new kind of bug but the the bug in our case was in <unk>
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 332.32 341.28 <NA> we wanted to be able to draw you know rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points and there was just too much friction
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 341.06 346.75 <NA> created between your finger and the glass if glass was the substrate <unk> which it usually is
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 346.75 354.97 <NA> so we found that that actually was a feature in the sense you could build a pressure sensitive display <unk> and when you touch it with your finger you can
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 354.93 360.79 <NA> <unk> actually then introduce all the forces on the face of that screen <unk> and
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 360.3 365.11 <NA> that actually has a certain amount of value let me see if i can
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 365.31 367.66 <NA> load another disc and show you 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 367.66 369.52 <NA> quickly an example
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 380.83 390.53 <NA> <unk> to the forces both in the plane of the screen x y <unk> and z at least in one direction we couldn 't figure out how to come in the other direction <unk> but
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 390.7 395.55 <NA> let me get rid of the slide and let 's see if this comes on
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 404.96 411.39 <NA> <unk> 's just <unk> if you will <unk> pushing on the screen to make a curve but this is the interesting part
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 413.03 416.46 <NA> <unk> <unk> i want to stop it for a second
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 415.97 425.14 <NA> because the movie is very badly made <unk> and the particular display was built about six years ago and when we moved from one room to another room
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 425.34 432.16 <NA> <unk> a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed so all we have is this this record <unk>
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 435.33 442.99 <NA> imagine that screen having lots of objects on it and the person has touched an object
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 442.65 448.52 <NA> one of n like he did there <unk> and then pushed on it now
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 450.13 455.99 <NA> <unk> a program where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light one is an anvil
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 455.83 457.16 <NA> on a
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 456.88 462.29 <NA> fuzzy rug and the other one is a ping pong ball on a sheet of glass <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 462.06 471.06 <NA> and when you touch it you have to really push very hard to move that anvil across the screen and yet you touch the ping pong ball very lightly and it
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 471.06 475.2 <NA> just scoots across the screen and what you can do
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 476 477.81 <NA> <unk> i didn 't mean to do that
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 477.35 480.3 <NA> what you can do is actually
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 479.84 488.73 <NA> feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties so again they don 't have to be weight they could be
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 488.24 494.35 <NA> a general trying to move troops and he 's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 506.7 513.8 <NA> <unk> one that at the interface there are physical properties in that transducer in this case it 's pressure and touches
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 513.62 518.27 <NA> that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 518.27 524.9 <NA> so it 's not simply looking at the quality or <unk> if you will the luxury of that interface <unk> but it 's actually looking at the
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 525.1 534.23 <NA> <unk> of presenting things that previously couldn 't be presented before i want to move on to another example <unk> which is one
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 533.92 535.73 <NA> of a of a
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 535.57 542.75 <NA> different sort where we 're trying to use computer and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 543.01 550.23 <NA> here the idea is that you 're going to take this book if you will and it 's going to come alive
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 550.31 554.38 <NA> <unk> you 're going to sort of breathe life into it we are so used
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 554.2 566.76 <NA> to to doing monologues <unk> filmmakers for example are the experts in monologue making you make a film and it has a well formed beginning middle and end and in some sense the art of it is that 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 566.27 567.61 <NA> and
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 567.4 575.23 <NA> you then say there 's an opportunity for making conversational movies well what does that mean <unk> and
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 579.75 588.56 <NA> <unk> of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium so book writing is the same thing what i 'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 588.35 597.53 <NA> where it is mixed now with all sorts of things live in there but you have to keep a few things in mind one is that
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 597.53 599.9 <NA> this book knows about itself
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 612.61 624.44 <NA> <unk> in the medium itself it 's just not a static movie frame that 's one thing the other is that you have to realize that it is a random access medium <unk> and you can in fact branch and expand and elaborate and shrink 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 643.16 649.6 <NA> <unk> that tells you how to do something like penguin and you get to the end of the recipe and it says cook until done
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 651.75 662.23 <NA> <unk> would be if you will the top green track which doesn 't mean too much <unk> but you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn 't an expert <unk> and say cook at three hundred and eighty degrees <unk>
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 662.13 671.98 <NA> <unk> for forty five minutes and then for a real beginner <unk> you would go down even further and elaborate more say open the oven preheat wait for the light to go out open the door 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 676.3 685.49 <NA> <unk> and that 's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back that 's one kind of of use of random access and the other is where <unk>
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 689.7 695.78 <NA> you want to explain the same thing in different ways if you 're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 696.04 704.88 <NA> <unk> the last thing you do is repeat what you just said <unk> you try and think of a different way of saying the same thing or if you know the particular
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 704.81 708.56 <NA> <unk> student and that student 's cognitive style then you might
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 708.34 718.33 <NA> say it in a way that you think would would have a good impedance match with that student there are all sorts of techniques you will use and again this is a different kind of
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 718.33 727.95 <NA> branching <unk> so what i will show you is it 's a rather boring book <unk> but i 'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 727.61 729.97 <NA> because your sponsors
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 729.93 731.2 <NA> <unk> aren 't necessarily
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 731 739.33 <NA> interested in fiction and entertainment <unk> and this is a book on how to repair a transmission 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 738.87 744.44 <NA> now i don 't even know what vintage the transmission is <unk> but let me just show you very quickly some of it
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 754.93 764.57 <NA> <unk> for each of these chapters nicholas negroponte now this is his table of contents just a picture of the transmission and as you rub your finger across the transmission it highlights the various parts narrator 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 764.77 768.53 <NA> when i find a chapter that i want to see i just touch the text
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 768.25 771.23 <NA> and the system will format pages for me to read <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 778.9 779.94 <NA> the words
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 779.9 782.79 <NA> <unk> or phrases that are lit up in red are
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 783.68 790.69 <NA> glossary words so i can get a different definition by just touching the word <unk> and the definition appears superimposed over the illustration
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 813.93 817.27 <NA> <unk> about the oil pan or the oil filter and <unk>
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 827.86 831.92 <NA> <unk> another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 836.59 839.67 <NA> i can get a definition of these words just by touching them <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 839.67 842.81 <NA> and the definition will appear in the illustration corner 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 847.57 854.97 <NA> i can get back to the illustration <unk> but in this case it 's not a single frame <unk> but it 's actually a movie of someone coming
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 854.93 863.16 <NA> <unk> into the frame and doing the repair that 's described in the text the two headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 862.91 869.55 <NA> at various speeds in forward or reverse <unk> and the movie is displayed as a full frame movie 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 870.86 873.12 <NA> i can go back to the beginning <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 874.34 876.1 <NA> and play the movie at full speed
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 887.98 888.98 <NA> 's another
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 909.49 915.06 <NA> <unk> loosen them too far if you loosen them too far you 'll have a big mess nn i suspect that
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 915.06 918.2 <NA> some of you might not even understand that language 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 923.11 929.97 <NA> ok <unk> i 'm at the third and last part of this which i said i would make an attempt to
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 930.1 937.89 <NA> at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment and of course <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 937.85 942.99 <NA> good education has got to be good entertainment <unk> so my
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 943.25 946.12 <NA> first example will be drawn from
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 945.83 946.83 <NA> a
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 946.61 953.74 <NA> very recent experiment that we 've been doing in this case in senegal where we have tried to use
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 954.96 957.55 <NA> <unk> personal computers as
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 957.18 961.33 <NA> as a pedagogical medium but not as teaching machines at all
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 961.16 971.38 <NA> the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles the child is if you will the teacher and the machine is the student <unk>
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 971.33 979.97 <NA> and the art of of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking but teaching kids programming per se is
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 980.08 982.44 <NA> <unk> utterly irrelevant <unk> and
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 982.2 986.03 <NA> there are just a few slides i want to go through but
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 985.83 988.26 <NA> there <unk> there 's a story i 'd like to
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 988.26 999.33 <NA> to tell <unk> and that was when before we did this in any developing countries we 're doing it in fact in three developing countries right now pakistan colombia and senegal we did it in
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 999.05 1000.05 <NA> some pretty rough
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1000 1009.05 <NA> <unk> areas of new york city <unk> and one child <unk> whose name i 've forgotten was about seven or eight years old absolutely
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1009.05 1010.58 <NA> considered
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1010.15 1019.7 <NA> mentally handicapped couldn 't couldn 't read <unk> didn 't even make it in the lowest section of the of the school 's classes
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1019.7 1024.15 <NA> and was pretty much not in school though physically there <unk> but
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1026.45 1032.31 <NA> <unk> where there were quite a few computers and learned this particular language called logo
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1032.06 1036.63 <NA> and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun it was very
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1036.26 1044.52 <NA> interesting <unk> and one day by chance some visitors from the nie came by
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1044.06 1053.26 <NA> in their double breasted suits looking at this at this setup <unk> and none of the children who were normally there except for this one child were
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1055.16 1059.28 <NA> <unk> and he said let me show you how this works and they
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1059.29 1071.42 <NA> got an absolutely ingenuous wonderful description of logo and the child was just zipping right through it showing them all sorts of things until they asked him how to do something which he couldn couldn 't explain
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1071.24 1078.88 <NA> and so he flipped through the manual found the explanation and typed the command and got it to do what they asked they were delighted and by the time
NicholasNegroponte_1984 1 NicholasNegroponte_1984 1078.54 1079.97 <NA> it was time to
