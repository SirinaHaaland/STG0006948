TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 333.94 335.86 <NA> let 's think of another example 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 335.65 346.18 <NA> working with children in care social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 346.18 350.11 <NA> so children in the state care tend to do very badly
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 350.55 357.23 <NA> <unk> only thirteen percent achieve a reasonable level of five gcses at sixteen <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 357.23 365.59 <NA> against fifty eight percent of the wider population more troublingly twenty seven percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 365.28 374.78 <NA> and even more worryingly <unk> and this is a home office statistic <unk> seventy percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care the state is not a great
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 377.26 379.8 <NA> <unk> there are great programs for

TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 384.82 393.29 <NA> so we set up a program with essex county council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those

TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 402.05 410.67 <NA> <unk> investors have put in three point one million pounds that program started last month <unk> others around homelessness in london around
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 410.54 418.03 <NA> youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country there are now thirteen social impact bonds in britain <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 418.03 424.69 <NA> and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world so david cameron 's put twenty million pounds
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 424.53 429.97 <NA> into a social outcomes fund to support this idea <unk> obama has suggested three
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 430.05 436.33 <NA> <unk> hundred million dollars in the u s budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 436.33 444.07 <NA> and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest so what 's caused this excitement why is this so different for people 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 444.09 453.68 <NA> well the first piece which we 've talked about is innovation it enables testing of new ideas in a way that 's less difficult
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 455.26 462.01 <NA> <unk> the second piece it brings is rigor <unk> by working to outcomes people really have to test and bring data
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 462.02 468.33 <NA> into the situation that one 's dealing with so taking peterborough as an example <unk> we
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 468.15 474.81 <NA> add case management across all of the different organizations that we 're working with so they know what actually has been done with different
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 475.64 487.44 <NA> <unk> and at the same time they learn from the ministry of justice and we learn because we pushed for the data what actually happens whether they get re arrested or not and we learn and adapt the program accordingly <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 487.13 493.33 <NA> and this leads to the third element which is new <unk> and that 's flexibility <unk> because
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 493.16 504.91 <NA> normal contracting for things when you 're spending government money you 're spending our money <unk> tax money <unk> and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control

TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 506.34 514.39 <NA> now any entrepreneur in the in the room knows that version one point zero the business plan is not the one that generally works <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 514.29 519.73 <NA> so when you 're trying to do something like this you need the flexibility to adapt the program 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 519.36 525.14 <NA> and again in peterborough <unk> we started off with a program but we also
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 526.69 528.21 <NA> <unk> over the period of time <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 528 539.51 <NA> we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 539.51 541.37 <NA> greater engagement
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 541 545.15 <NA> from the prisoners longer term engagement as well <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 545.32 554.46 <NA> the last element is partnership <unk> there is at the moment a stale debate going on very often state 's better <unk> public sector 's better private sector 's better
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 555.47 565.44 <NA> <unk> social sector 's better for a lot of these programs actually for creating social change we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work <unk> 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 565.44 569.31 <NA> and this creates a structure through which they can combine 
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 569.06 573.31 <NA> so where does this leave us this leaves us with a way
TobyEccles_2013G 1 TobyEccles_2013G 573.15 579.73 <NA> that people can invest in social change <unk> we 've met thousands <unk> possibly millions of people who want the
