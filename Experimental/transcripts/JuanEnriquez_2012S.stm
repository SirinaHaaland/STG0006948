JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 23.95 29.97 <NA> all energy is concentrated into a single point of energy for some reason it explodes and you begin to get
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 29.9 39.12 <NA> <unk> these things <unk> so you 're now about fourteen billion years into this <unk> and these things expand and expand and expand into these giant galaxies and you get trillions of them 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 39.5 48.06 <NA> and within these galaxies you get these enormous dust clouds <unk> and i want you to pay particular attention to the three little prongs in the center of this picture 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 47.99 49.93 <NA> if you take a close up of those they

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 61.05 65.81 <NA> and what 's happening is there 's so much dust it comes together and it fuses
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 65.81 75.26 <NA> and ignites a thermonuclear reaction <unk> and so what you 're watching is the birth of stars these are stars being born out of here when enough stars
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 75.28 82.94 <NA> <unk> come out they create a galaxy this one happens to be a particularly important galaxy because you are here 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 83.53 90.62 <NA> laughter and as you take a close up of this galaxy you find a relatively normal not particularly interesting star

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 94.84 99.56 <NA> so this star doesn 't even appear until about two thirds of the way into this story <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 99.56 104.94 <NA> and then what happens is there 's enough dust left over that it doesn 't ignite into a star it becomes a
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 104.9 108.55 <NA> <unk> planet <unk> and this is about a

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 110.9 117.36 <NA> and soon thereafter there 's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup <unk>

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 129.93 136.06 <NA> <unk> now the really strange thing is life goes kaput not once not twice <unk> but five times <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 135.84 140.86 <NA> so almost all life on earth is wiped out about five times <unk>

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 161.44 169.43 <NA> so within that context there 's two theories of the case as to why we 're all here the first theory of the case is that 's all she wrote

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 188.99 193.56 <NA> and that 's the purpose of the universe <unk> and then it flat lines it doesn 't get any better 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 197.96 203.53 <NA> the only question you might want to ask yourself is could that be just mildly arrogant
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 206.31 212.71 <NA> <unk> and if it is and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 212.91 220.04 <NA> there were only about two thousand of our species left a few more weeks without rain we would have never seen any of these
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 233.5 242.72 <NA> <unk> so maybe you have to think about a second theory if the first one isn 't good enough second theory is could we upgrade 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 243.82 249.84 <NA> well why would one ask a question like that because there have been at least twenty nine upgrades so far of

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 264.05 270.99 <NA> and as you 're thinking about this <unk> you might also ask the question so why a single human species <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 271.34 278.68 <NA> wouldn 't it be really odd if you went to africa and asia and antarctica and found exactly the same bird

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 300.19 307.52 <NA> <unk> of affairs then you might ask yourself all right so if we want to create something else how big does a mutation have to be 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 307.75 316.19 <NA> well svante paabo has the answer the difference between humans and neanderthal is zero point zero zero four percent of gene code 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 316.51 319.91 <NA> that 's how big the difference is one species to another 
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 320.59 323.67 <NA> this explains most contemporary political debates
JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 328.1 334.68 <NA> <unk> but as you 're thinking about this one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place

JuanEnriquez_2012S 1 JuanEnriquez_2012S 350.64 356.02 <NA> <unk> so about ten thousand years ago by the black sea we had one mutation in one gene
