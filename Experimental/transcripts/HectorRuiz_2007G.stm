HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 29.84 34.35 <NA> <unk> about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology

HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 37.64 44.34 <NA> because i really think when i look back at how i actually ended up

HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 327.73 336.83 <NA> is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today so one of our passions in our company <unk> and now one of my personal passions 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 336.84 341.47 <NA> is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 341.27 350.17 <NA> accessible and affordable and to me that is very very critical now technology has changed a lot since the victrola days you know we now have
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 351.24 353.41 <NA> <unk> incredibly powerful computers 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 353.25 364.96 <NA> a tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the internet although frankly speaking we don 't believe the internet is the killer app what we believe is that the internet frankly is a connection of people and ideas

HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 367.07 373.57 <NA> in which those people and ideas get connected <unk> and the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 373.08 379.67 <NA> and so we believe that through all the changes that have occurred that we 're faced today with a tremendous
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 379.63 384.38 <NA> <unk> opportunity if we can connect people and ideas more

HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 385.32 387.14 <NA> and although
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 387.14 396.62 <NA> you 've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today <unk> the key to me is how many of these products
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 396.19 399.72 <NA> are able to provide people connectivity
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 408.14 415.35 <NA> <unk> regardless of the economic status that a person could have that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 414.98 424.32 <NA> so when you look at that we said well we would like to then enable that a little bit we would like to create an initiative <unk> and a couple of years ago at amd 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 424.31 428.41 <NA> we came up with this idea of saying <unk> what if we create this initiative we call
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 430.14 436.53 <NA> <unk> where we are going to aim <unk> that by the year two thousand and fifteen half of the world will be connected to the internet
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 436.54 449.72 <NA> so that people and ideas can get connected <unk> we knew we couldn 't do it by ourselves and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at amd could do it alone <unk> we always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 450.73 459.03 <NA> <unk> educational institutions a myriad of other companies and frankly even competitors so it is really a
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 458.79 462.53 <NA> rather lofty initiative if you want to think that way <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 462.3 472.43 <NA> but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead that was bold enough and and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 472.43 474.99 <NA> and i 'll come back to that in a minute because i think
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 474.83 479.97 <NA> the results so far have been remarkable <unk> and i can only anticipate
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 479.93 489.03 <NA> <unk> and get real excited about what i think is going to happen in the next eight years <unk> while we get to the two thousand and fifteen initiative where are we today 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 488.87 492.52 <NA> that 's year by year this comes from our
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 492.18 493.23 <NA> friends at <unk>
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 494.29 500.08 <NA> those of you who 've never looked at their website you should look at it it 's really impressive and you can see how
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 500 508.33 <NA> <unk> the internet penetration has changed over the years <unk> and so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well where are we related to our goal
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 508.13 513.46 <NA> towards two thousand and fifteen the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces one
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 513.26 517.91 <NA> is the western world <unk> defined mostly by western europe and the united states 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 517.91 525.02 <NA> has made an awful lot of progress the connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 525.85 532.73 <NA> <unk> we think reaching one hundred percent is very doable <unk> even before the two thousand and fifteen timeframe <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 532.73 540.35 <NA> in other parts of emerging countries such as india and china <unk> the progress has been good has been solid has been good 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 540.19 546.33 <NA> but in places that are not as developed places like africa <unk> latin america
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 546.15 550.05 <NA> and other places in the world <unk> the progress has been rather slow
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 550.34 555.44 <NA> <unk> as a matter of fact <unk> i was just recently visiting south africa i had the opportunity to
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 555.45 564.45 <NA> have a discussion with president mbeki <unk> and one of the things that we talked about is what is it that 's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 563.99 571.08 <NA> and one of the reasons is in south africa it costs one hundred dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 570.65 579.97 <NA> it is impossible <unk> even in the united states for that cost to be able to enable the connectivity that we 're all trying to reach so we talked about ways
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 579.99 581.17 <NA> <unk> in which perhaps
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 580.97 585.85 <NA> one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 585.36 591.76 <NA> so when you look at this chart you look at the very last it 's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale you look at the very end 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 591.45 599.96 <NA> we 've got quite a long way to go to get to the two thousand and fifteen goal of fifty percent but we 're excited in our company we 're motivated we really think it 's a
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 600 602.33 <NA> phenomenal driver of things 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 601.9 610.41 <NA> to force us to do things differently <unk> and we look forward to being able to actually working with so many partners around the world <unk> to be able to
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 610.23 614.84 <NA> reach that goal now one of the things i 'd like to <unk>
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 615.99 620.87 <NA> which i think is really critical is that it is not a charity <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 620.95 627.26 <NA> it is actually a business venture <unk> let 's take a small segment of this of this
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 627.07 629.91 <NA> unconnected world <unk> and call it the education
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 629.84 636.67 <NA> <unk> market <unk> when you look at elementary school children we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 636.49 640.98 <NA> that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the internet 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 640.73 649.93 <NA> therefore when we see that we see an opportunity to to have a business that addresses the need of that segment and when we embarked in
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 650.55 652.94 <NA> <unk> from the very beginning we said it very clearly 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 652.94 662.09 <NA> this is not a charity this is really a business venture one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market <unk> because what we have learned in the last three years
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 661.93 665.02 <NA> is that this segment of the market whether it 's education or <unk>
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 666.69 674.75 <NA> <unk> nations either way it 's a segment that demands incredibly high quality incredibly high reliability tremendous low cost and
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 675.61 677.27 <NA> <unk> and a lot of
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 677.44 678.95 <NA> challenges
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 678.78 685.25 <NA> that frankly <unk> without actually doing it it would be very difficult to understand and i 'll explain that in just a minute <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 685.3 694.41 <NA> it is an initiative that is focused on simple accessible and <unk> human centric solutions what we mean by that is you know frankly the pc was invented in
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 705.05 707.49 <NA> <unk> and it looks the same <unk> and frankly
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 707.24 712.26 <NA> and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this but i truly mean it
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 711.86 720.85 <NA> if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it it would be very difficult to judge who made it because they 're all highly commoditized
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 720.85 729.97 <NA> but they 're all different so there has not been a <unk> human centric approach to addressing this segment of the market so we really believe it is critical to think of it it reminded
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 729.93 733.28 <NA> <unk> me a lot of the talk we heard this morning about this
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 733.07 740.95 <NA> operating room machinery that was designed specifically for africa we 're talking about something very similar here <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 740.52 750.31 <NA> and it has to be based on a geo sensitive approach what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world <unk> the government plays a key role in the development of technology <unk> in other parts it doesn 't <unk> 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 749.82 752.26 <NA> in other parts of the world you have
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 752.07 754.16 <NA> an infrastructure that allows for
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 755.2 762.26 <NA> <unk> to take place <unk> in other parts it doesn 't and then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 761.89 767.33 <NA> and put into action in those regions and the last piece which is really important
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 767.33 774.18 <NA> and this is an opinion that we have not shared by many this is one where we seem to stand alone on this one
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 773.97 779.82 <NA> is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 779.78 781.62 <NA> <unk> integrated <unk> end to end ecosystems 
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 781.62 790.06 <NA> what i mean by that and let me use this example the country of south africa <unk> because i was just there therefore i 'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 789.67 793.32 <NA> they have it 's a country of forty five million people it

HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 813.87 819.67 <NA> and to my surprise i learned in south africa they have eighteen dialects i always thought they only had two
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 819.51 823.93 <NA> english and afrikaans but it turns out they have eighteen dialects and to be able to
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 823.93 829.94 <NA> to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system it could
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 829.9 835.65 <NA> <unk> only be done from from inside <unk> i don 't think this segment of the market
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 835.47 843.16 <NA> can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world <unk> and just dumping product and selling into the markets so we believe
HectorRuiz_2007G 1 HectorRuiz_2007G 843.16 850.05 <NA> that in those regions of the world where the population is large and there 's an infrastructure that can provide it that a local integrated
