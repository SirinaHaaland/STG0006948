KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 19.62 26.6 <NA> and that 's what i say when people ask me what i do but it really confuses most people so really the best way for me to convey it
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 26.6 29.94 <NA> is to take the technology and be creative and

KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 31.12 38.02 <NA> so i tried to think what i could use for here and a couple of weeks ago i had a crazy idea that i wanted to print
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 37.84 44.88 <NA> two dj decks and to try and mix some music and i 'm going to try and show that at the end and
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 44.88 48.27 <NA> the suspense will be as much mine if it works
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 48.11 52.38 <NA> and i 'm not a dj and i 'm not a musician so i 'm a little bit scared of that
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 53.15 54.94 <NA> so i think
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 55.19 57.73 <NA> i found the best way to describe
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 57.75 68.17 <NA> my journey is just to mention a few little things that have happened to me throughout my life there 's three particular things that i that i 've done and i 'll just describe those first and then talk about some of my work
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 68.19 73.21 <NA> so when i was a kid i was obsessed with wires and
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 72.75 80 <NA> i used to thread them under my carpet and thread them behind the walls and have little switches and little speakers and i wanted to make my
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 79.96 84.54 <NA> <unk> bedroom be interactive but kind of all hidden away and i was also
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 84.3 94.79 <NA> really interested in in wireless as well so i bought one of those little kits that you could get to make a radio transmitter and i got an old book and i carved out the inside <unk>
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 94.74 99.9 <NA> and i hid it inside there and then i placed it next to my dad and snuck
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 100.13 104.52 <NA> <unk> back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio so i could eavesdrop
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 104.39 110.49 <NA> i was not at all interested in what he was saying it 's more that i just liked the idea of an everyday object
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 110.18 113.61 <NA> having something inside and doing something different
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 114.98 122.55 <NA> several year later i managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn 't really leave school with
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 122.21 129.94 <NA> with much much to show for at all and my parents maybe as a reward bought me what turned out to be
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 130.02 134.65 <NA> <unk> a one way ticket to australia and i came back home about four years later
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 135.33 137.71 <NA> i ended up on a farm
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 137.48 141.81 <NA> in the middle of nowhere it was in far western new south wales
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 141.81 149.99 <NA> and this farm was one hundred and twenty thousand acres there were twenty two thousand sheep and it was about forty degrees or one hundred or so fahrenheit
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 150.91 156.56 <NA> <unk> and on this farm there was the farmer his wife and there was the four year old daughter
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 156.56 162.11 <NA> and they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 162.13 169.37 <NA> obviously one of the most important things was the sheep and so my job was well pretty much to do everything but it was about
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 169.37 179.88 <NA> bringing the sheep back to the homestead and we 'd do that by building fences using motorbikes and horses and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 179.84 180.96 <NA> <unk> seasons
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 181.52 189.2 <NA> and what i learned was although at the time like everyone else i thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn 't do what we wanted them to do
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 189.21 194.8 <NA> what i realize now probably only just in the last few weeks looking back is the sheep weren 't stupid at all
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 194.44 199.31 <NA> we 'd put them in an environment where they didn 't want to be and they didn 't want to do what we wanted them to do
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 199.31 204.88 <NA> so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by by listening to the weather the
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 205.02 211.55 <NA> <unk> of the land and and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 211.55 219.55 <NA> another bunch of years later i ended up at cambridge university at the cavendish laboratory in the u k doing a ph d in physics
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 219.15 224.83 <NA> my ph d was to move electrons around one at a time
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 224.43 229.91 <NA> and i realize again it 's kind of these realizations looking back as to what i did i realize
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 229.81 234.53 <NA> <unk> now that it was pretty much the same as as moving sheep around
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 234.67 245.15 <NA> it really is it 's just you do it by changing an environment and that 's kind of been a big lesson to me that you can 't act on any object you change its environment and the object will flow
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 245.15 253.05 <NA> so we made it very small so things were about thirty nanometers in size making it very cold so
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 252.83 254.58 <NA> at liquid helium temperatures
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 255.17 264.6 <NA> <unk> and changing environment by changing the voltage and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time on and off a little memory node
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 264.4 276.87 <NA> and i wanted to go one step further and i wanted to move one electron on and one electron off and i was told that i wouldn 't be able to do this which you know as we 've heard from other people that 's the thing that makes you do it
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 276.87 279.61 <NA> and i was determined and i managed to show
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 279.99 285.77 <NA> <unk> i could do that and a lot of that learning i think came from being on that farm because when i was working on the farm
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 285.77 296.86 <NA> we 'd have to use what was around us we 'd have to use the environment and there was no such thing as something can 't be done because you 're in an environment where if you can 't do what you need to do
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 296.4 300.82 <NA> you can die and you know i had seen that sort of thing
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 300.6 304.94 <NA> happen so now my obsession is printing
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 304.96 314.4 <NA> <unk> and i 'm really fascinated by the idea of using conventional printing processes so the types of print that are used to create many of the things around us
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 314.4 318.08 <NA> to make paper and card interactive
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 317.62 324.44 <NA> when i spoke to some printers when i started doing this and told them what i wanted to do which was to print conductive inks onto paper
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 324.01 327.77 <NA> they told me it couldn 't be done again that kind of favorite thing
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 327.46 329.4 <NA> so i
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 329.96 340.08 <NA> <unk> i got about ten credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy really and bought myself this huge printing press which i had no idea how to use <unk>
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 339.98 347.59 <NA> <unk> at all it was about five meters long and i covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess but i learned to print
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 354.96 356.08 <NA> <unk> the case
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 357.36 358.87 <NA> so
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 358.38 368.77 <NA> what we do is we take conventional printing presses we make conductive inks and run those through a press and basically just letting hundreds of thousands <unk>
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 368.67 375.05 <NA> <unk> of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive and it 's pretty simple really it 's just
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 375.88 379.7 <NA> <unk> of things that have been done before but bringing them together in a different way
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 379.3 382.62 <NA> so we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 382.41 390.54 <NA> and then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips one to run some capacitive touch software so we know where we 've touched it
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 390.54 397.19 <NA> and the other to run quite often some wireless software so the piece of paper can can connect
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 397.03 404.82 <NA> so i 'll just describe a couple of things that that we 've created there 's lots of different things we 've created this is one of them because i love
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 404.78 416.23 <NA> <unk> cake and this one it 's a large poster and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions and it works out your perfect cake
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 416.23 424.66 <NA> but it doesn 't tell you the cake there and then it uploads a picture and the reason why it chose that cake for you to our facebook page
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 424.42 429.85 <NA> and and to twitter so we 're trying to create that connection between the physical and the
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 429.78 434.77 <NA> <unk> digital but have it not looking on a screen and just looking like a regular poster
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 435.18 437.26 <NA> we 've worked with
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 436.86 442.28 <NA> a bunch of universities on a on a project looking at interactive newsprint
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 442.28 454.7 <NA> so for example we 've created a newspaper a regular newspaper you can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly and when you touch it you can hear the music that 's described on the top which is something you can 't read you can hear
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 454.84 464.87 <NA> a press conference as well as reading what the editor has determined that press conference was about and you can press a facebook like button or you can vote on something as well
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 464.77 475.34 <NA> something else that we created and this was an idea that i had a couple of years ago and so we 've done a project on this it was for funding from the government for user centered design for energy efficient buildings <unk>
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 475.24 479.85 <NA> <unk> difficult to say and something i had no idea what it was when i went into the workshop but quickly learned
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 480.17 490.68 <NA> and we wanted to try and encourage people to to use energy better and i really liked the idea that instead of looking at dials and reading things to say
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 490.25 504.73 <NA> looking at your energy usage i wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected and had color changing inks on it and so if your energy usage was trending better than the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear and all would be good and if it
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 504.98 512.75 <NA> 't then there 'd be graffiti and the leaves would fall off the trees so it was trying to make you look after something in your immediate environment
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 512.54 522.91 <NA> which you don 't want to see not looking so good rather than expecting people to do things in the local environment because of the effect that it has a long way off and i think kind of like going back <unk>
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 522.81 529.01 <NA> <unk> to the farm it 's about how to let people do what you want them to do rather than making people do what you want them to do
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 530.86 534.53 <NA> okay so this is the bit i 'm really scared of
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 534.73 541.67 <NA> so a couple of things i 've created are there 's a poster over here that you can play drums on
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 541.3 545.51 <NA> and i am not a musician it seemed like a good idea at the time if
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 546.37 555 <NA> anyone wants to try and play drums then they can i 'll just describe how this works this poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone and
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 554.96 557.79 <NA> <unk> when you touch it it connects to the app drums
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 565.7 571.05 <NA> and it has really good response time it 's using bluetooth four so it 's pretty instantaneous
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 572.01 573.01 <NA> okay
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 579.9 581.83 <NA> <unk> couple of other things so
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 581.73 585.31 <NA> this one is like a sound board so you can touch it and i just love these horrible noises sirens explosions breaking glass okay
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 596.85 601.37 <NA> <unk> and this is a d j turntable so it 's wirelessly linked to my ipad
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 606.16 612.65 <NA> <unk> oh yes i just love doing that i 'm not a d j though but i just always wanted to do that scratching
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 614.8 619.04 <NA> so i have a crossfader and i have the two decks
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 620.08 625.8 <NA> so i 've made some new technology and i love things being creative and i love working with creative people so
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 625.8 629.58 <NA> my fifteen year old niece she 's amazing and she 's called charlotte and i
KateStone_2013 1 KateStone_2013 629.9 636.64 <NA> <unk> asked her to record something and i worked with a friend called elliot to put some beats together so this is my niece charlotte
