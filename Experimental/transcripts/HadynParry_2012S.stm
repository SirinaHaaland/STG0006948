HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 355.13 360.16 <NA> trying to kill the insects as they fly around this is a picture of fogging

HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 404.9 412.92 <NA> <unk> point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there we want something that gets that population right the way down so it can 't get the disease transmission

HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 466.9 475.89 <NA> whatever we do has got to get to that insect it 's got to get into people 's houses into the bedrooms into the kitchens now there are two

HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 492.89 495.76 <NA> and the second is a phenomenon
HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 495.55 504.85 <NA> that males are very very good at finding females if there 's a male mosquito that you release and if there 's a female around that male will find the female
HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 506.4 509.53 <NA> so basically we 've used those two factors <unk> 
HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 510.12 512.54 <NA> so here 's a typical situation 
HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 512.54 519.98 <NA> male meets female lots of offspring a single female will lay about up to one hundred eggs at a time up to about five hundred

HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 538.81 546.42 <NA> the offspring will actually die at different stages but i 'll call them sterile for now if you put more sterile males out into the environment <unk>

HadynParry_2012S 1 HadynParry_2012S 555.41 563.73 <NA> <unk> so the males will go out they 'll look for females they 'll mate if they mate successfully then no offspring if they don 't find a female <unk>
