JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 36.09 41.4 <NA> and we 're conscious we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 40.94 50.14 <NA> we used to think we 're alone in this but now we know we 're not we 're not the only medical doctors <unk> now we know that there 's a lot of animals out there that can do it too most famous perhaps
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 51.06 61.18 <NA> <unk> not so much different from us they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites but the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too <unk> elephants porcupines sheep goats <unk>
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 61.13 69.32 <NA> you name it and even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 79.99 91.73 <NA> <unk> therefore there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases <unk> now i think that we should look at these animals and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases <unk> 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 91.96 104.82 <NA> as a biologist i have been studying monarch butterflies for the last ten years <unk> now monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations from the u s and canada down to mexico every year <unk> where millions of them come together
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 104.87 107.41 <NA> but it 's not why i started studying them 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 107.41 117.15 <NA> i study monarchs because they get sick <unk> they get sick like you they get sick like me and i think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans <unk> 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 116.69 120.25 <NA> now the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 122.41 125.02 <NA> a mouthful what they do is they produce spores
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 125 135.14 <NA> <unk> millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly <unk> and this is really detrimental to the monarch it shortens their lifespan 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 135.09 141.79 <NA> <unk> it reduces their ability to fly it can even kill them before they 're even adults very detrimental parasite 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 154.93 161.81 <NA> <unk> these milkweeds have cardenolides in them these are chemicals that are toxic they 're toxic to most animals but not to monarchs in fact 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 161.81 174.23 <NA> monarchs can take up the chemicals put it in their own bodies and it makes them toxic against their predators such as birds <unk> and what they do then is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange black and white 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 173.95 179.1 <NA> so what i did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse different ones
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 180.02 185.88 <NA> <unk> some were toxic <unk> including the tropical milkweed with very high concentrations of these cardenolides 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 185.88 199.99 <NA> and some were not toxic <unk> and then i fed them to monarchs some of the monarchs were healthy they had no disease <unk> but some of the monarchs were sick and what i found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 200.16 205.66 <NA> <unk> meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants <unk> 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 205.17 218.71 <NA> and when i found this i had this idea <unk> and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea <unk> but i thought what if monarchs can use this <unk> what if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine what if they can act as medical doctors 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 218.43 224.75 <NA> so my team and i started doing experiments in the first types of experiments we had caterpillars and gave them a choice 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 227.5 234.56 <NA> <unk> and then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime <unk> and the result as so often in science was boring
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 234.1 242.03 <NA> <unk> fifty percent of their food was medicinal fifty percent was not these caterpillars didn 't do anything for their own welfare 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 242.05 254.97 <NA> so then we moved on to adult butterflies <unk> and we started asking the question whether it 's the mothers that can medicate their offspring can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 255.41 263.55 <NA> we have done these experiments now over several years and always get the same results what we do is we put a monarch in a big cage a medicinal plant on one side <unk>
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 265.24 270.19 <NA> and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant <unk> 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 270.19 279.55 <NA> and what we find when we do that is always the same what we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed in other words what these females are doing is they 're laying
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 279.89 282.58 <NA> <unk> sixty eight percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 282.21 292.81 <NA> intriguingly <unk> what they do is they actually transmit the parasites when they 're laying the eggs they cannot prevent this they can also not medicate themselves but what these experiments <unk>
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 292.71 300.05 <NA> <unk> tell us is that these monarchs these mothers can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 303.52 308.12 <NA> <unk> a really important discovery i think not just because it tells us something cool about nature <unk> 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 307.92 312.14 <NA> but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 312.14 320.54 <NA> now these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple they have tiny little brains yet they can do this very sophisticated medication 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 320.47 325.02 <NA> now we know that even today most of our drugs derive from natural products
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 325.01 330.46 <NA> <unk> including plants and in indigenous cultures traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 330.46 337.56 <NA> in this way elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset <unk> and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea <unk> 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 337.19 349.65 <NA> what i think is important though is to move beyond these large brained mammals and give these guys more credit these simple animals these insects that we tend to think of as very very simple with tiny little brains 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 349.65 355 <NA> the discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 355.2 364.1 <NA> <unk> new avenues and i think that maybe one day we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies <unk> 
JaapDeRoode_2014Y 1 JaapDeRoode_2014Y 364.1 369.02 <NA> and i think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing thank you so much
