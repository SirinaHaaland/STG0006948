ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 836.52 837.96 <NA> get back
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 837.75 844.07 <NA> to my work in the process however i became part of a disturbing trend in america
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 844.07 850.5 <NA> where scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 850.82 854.34 <NA> <unk> when i got back to my work i asked this question <unk> 
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 853.85 862.44 <NA> if i plant a false memory in your mind <unk> does it have repercussions does it affect your later thoughts your later behaviors 
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 862.04 872.37 <NA> our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods hard boiled eggs dill pickles strawberry ice cream and we found that <unk>
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 872.27 878.58 <NA> <unk> once we planted this false memory <unk> people didn 't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor picnic 
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 879.96 890.68 <NA> <unk> necessarily bad or unpleasant if we planted a warm fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus we could get people to want to eat asparagus <unk>
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 890.58 900.11 <NA> <unk> more <unk> and so what these studies are showing is that you can plant false memories and they have repercussions that affect behavior long after
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 903.13 912.02 <NA> <unk> along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues

ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 918.31 925.23 <NA> therapists can 't ethically plant false memories in the mind of their patients even if it would help the patient
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 925.64 929.43 <NA> <unk> but there 's nothing to stop a parent from trying this out on their

ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 965.97 979.58 <NA> but maybe my work has made me different from most people most people cherish their memories know that they represent their identity who they are where they came from and i appreciate that i feel that way too
ElizabethLoftus_2013G 1 ElizabethLoftus_2013G 979.84 983.66 <NA> <unk> but i know from my work how much fiction
