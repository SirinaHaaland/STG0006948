ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 425.63 429.43 <NA> instead of just going home and calling it quits i took a step back

ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 438.54 448.67 <NA> well i thought when you 're looking at information at this level <unk> it 's so easy to lose track of what you 're doing it 's easy to not see the forest through the trees it 's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole

ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 484.37 492.79 <NA> so with these ideas in mind <unk> i sprinted out of my basement lab at work to my basement lab at home <unk> which looked pretty much the same the main difference is at work 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 492.79 497.4 <NA> i 'm surrounded by cyber materials and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation

ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 805.16 813.29 <NA> <unk> i bet i can find one of those things <unk> so the next step in my binary analysis process is to look at pieces of information that are similar to each other <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 813.05 817.07 <NA> it 's really really hard to do at a binary level <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 816.86 820.91 <NA> but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 820.91 829.97 <NA> i don 't even have to sift through the raw data all i have to do is wait for the image to light up to see when i 'm at similar pieces <unk> i follow these strands of similarity like a trail
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 829.96 833.6 <NA> <unk> of bread crumbs to find exactly what i 'm looking for <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 833.23 840.83 <NA> so at this point in the process i 've located the code responsible for controlling your battery <unk> but that 's still not enough to blow up a phone 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 840.83 846.77 <NA> the last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 846.49 852.59 <NA> for this i need to identify very subtle very detailed relationships within that binary information
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 852.28 854.97 <NA> another very hard thing to do when looking at
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 854.9 856.38 <NA> <unk> at ones and zeros <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 856.16 866.28 <NA> but if we translate that information into a physical representation <unk> we can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work <unk> it can find all the detailed patterns all the important pieces <unk>
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 866.23 872.61 <NA> for us it can find out exactly how the pieces of that code work together to control that battery <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 875.55 879.43 <NA> <unk> whereas the same process would have taken months in the past <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 879.3 886.57 <NA> this is all well and good in a theoretical blow up a terrorist 's phone situation i wanted to find out if this would really work
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 886.17 892.21 <NA> in the work i do every day <unk> so i was playing around with these same concepts
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 892.14 894.13 <NA> with some of the data i 've
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 893.73 895.49 <NA> looked at in the past <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 895.49 903.31 <NA> and yet again i was trying to find a very detailed specific piece of code inside of a massive piece of binary information <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 903.48 904.97 <NA> so i looked at it
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 904.93 909.05 <NA> <unk> at this level <unk> thinking i was looking at the right thing only to see
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 908.82 913.61 <NA> this doesn 't have the connectivity i would have expected for the code i was looking for 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 913.12 920.18 <NA> in fact i 'm not really sure what this is <unk> but when i stepped back a level and looked at the similarities within the code i saw <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 919.72 924.89 <NA> this doesn 't have similarities like any code that exists out there i can 't even be looking at code 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 929.33 931.41 <NA> <unk> this is an image of some sort 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 931.1 935.76 <NA> and from here i can see it 's not just an image <unk> this is a photograph <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 935.76 942.63 <NA> now that i know it 's a photograph i 've got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 942.2 950.05 <NA> so in a matter of seconds we can take this information <unk> shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 952.98 954.76 <NA> <unk> it was that darn kitten again 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 956.01 963.55 <NA> all this is enabled because we were able to find a way to translate a very hard problem to something our brains do very naturally <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 963.3 966.01 <NA> so what does this mean 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 965.88 969.64 <NA> well for kittens it means no more hiding in ones and zeros <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 969.42 972.97 <NA> for me <unk> it means no more wasted weekends 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 972.72 979.97 <NA> for cyber <unk> it means we have a radical new way to tackle the most impossible problems <unk> it means we have a new weapon
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 980.13 983.03 <NA> in the evolving theater of cyber warfare <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 982.63 990.35 <NA> but for all of us it means that cyber engineers now have the ability to become first responders in emergency situations <unk> 
ChrisDomas_2013X 1 ChrisDomas_2013X 990.01 995.49 <NA> when seconds count <unk> we 've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys <unk> thank you
