EricGiler_2009G 1 EricGiler_2009G 285.3 292.9 <NA> and then what you do is you start out with electricity turn it into magnetic field take that magnetic field turn it back into electricity and then you can use it 
EricGiler_2009G 1 EricGiler_2009G 294.39 300.49 <NA> number one question i get asked i mean people are worried about cellphones being safe you know what about safety the
EricGiler_2009G 1 EricGiler_2009G 300.06 304.61 <NA> first thing is this is not a radiative technology it doesn 't radiate
EricGiler_2009G 1 EricGiler_2009G 305.11 318.83 <NA> <unk> there aren 't electric fields here it 's a magnetic field it stays within either what we call the source or within the device <unk> and actually the magnetic fields we 're using are basically about the same as the earth 's magnetic field we live in a magnetic field 
EricGiler_2009G 1 EricGiler_2009G 318.37 329.4 <NA> and the other thing that 's pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency and it 's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen
EricGiler_2009G 1 EricGiler_2009G 330.13 340.74 <NA> then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do they 've pretty much set field exposure limits which all of the things in the stuff i 'll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines <unk>
