KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 130.74 141.13 <NA> and romo will actually stream video to this device so i can see everything that romo sees and i get a robot 's eye view of the world now this is a free app on the app store so if any of you guys had this app on your phones we <unk>
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 141.03 151.87 <NA> <unk> could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together so i 'll show you really quickly romo actually he 's streaming video so you can see me and the entire ted audience if i get in front of romo here

KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 184.91 190.65 <NA> <unk> but the most important thing about romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally

KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 210.93 224.93 <NA> to control him so he actually streams two way audio and video between any two smart devices so you can log in through the browser and it 's kind of like skype on wheels so we were talking before about telepresence and this is a really cool example you can imagine an
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 226.99 235.06 <NA> <unk> who has an iphone and her mom buys her a robot that girl can take her iphone <unk> put it on the robot send an email to grandma who lives on the other side of the country

KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 268.81 279.97 <NA> code and create any behavior for this robot you want you do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for romo and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser which is what you see romo doing on the left <unk> and then if

KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 293.69 304.91 <NA> the reason we 're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal they change from person to person
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 304.92 311.69 <NA> so we think that if you 're going to have a robot in your home that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination <unk> 
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 311.26 318.2 <NA> so i wish that i could tell you what the the future of personal robotics looks like to be honest i have no idea
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 317.92 329.94 <NA> <unk> but what we do know is that it isn 't ten years or ten billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away the future of personal robotics is happening today <unk> and it
KellerRinaudo_2013 1 KellerRinaudo_2013 329.96 340.78 <NA> <unk> going to depend on small agile robots like romo and the creativity of people like yourselves <unk> so we can 't wait to get you all robots and we can 't wait to see what you build <unk> thank you
