JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 13.48 15.44 <NA> <unk> the history of computers
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 15.16 25.29 <NA> we 've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 25.25 26.82 <NA> <unk> can go wild
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 26.72 30.69 <NA> and this gap has become shorter
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 30.38 42.69 <NA> shorter and even shorter and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter the thickness of a touch screen glass and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 44.27 49.44 <NA> but i wondered what if there could be no boundary at all
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 49.31 53.13 <NA> i started to imagine what this would look like
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 53.15 54.82 <NA> first i
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 54.75 63.4 <NA> <unk> created this tool which penetrates into the digital space so when you press it hard on the screen it transfers its physical body into pixels
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 63.42 71.8 <NA> designers can materialize their ideas directly in three d and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 72 74.99 <NA> so with this tool this boundary
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 75 76.46 <NA> <unk> has been broken
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 76.96 86.75 <NA> but our two hands still remain outside the screen how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 86.74 91.46 <NA> at microsoft applied sciences along with my mentor cati boulanger
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 91 97.97 <NA> i redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 97.57 104.94 <NA> by combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 104.93 110.34 <NA> <unk> inside this three d space and grab pixels with your bare hands
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 112.85 120.27 <NA> applause because windows and files have a position in the real space selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 119.96 129.94 <NA> then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 129.93 131.47 <NA> <unk> hands directly
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 131.37 136.27 <NA> so in these examples we are reaching into the digital world
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 135.78 142.18 <NA> but how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 142.77 152.65 <NA> i 'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online but now you don 't have to worry about it what i got here is an online augmented fitting room
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 153.87 154.97 <NA> this is a view
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 155.02 161.09 <NA> <unk> that you get from head mounted or see through display when the system understands the geometry of your body
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 162.7 166.46 <NA> taking this idea further i started to think
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 166.45 174.2 <NA> instead of just seeing these pixels in our space how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 175.09 179.94 <NA> what would such a future look like at mit media lab
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 180.25 184.12 <NA> along with my advisor hiroshi ishii and my collaborator rehmi post
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 183.88 187.69 <NA> we created this one physical pixel
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 187.45 188.93 <NA> well in this case
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 188.94 199.51 <NA> this spherical magnet acts like a three d pixel in our space which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little three d space
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 199.33 203.41 <NA> what we did was essentially canceling gravity
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 203.2 204.79 <NA> and controlling the movement by
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 204.75 210.16 <NA> <unk> combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 210.27 222.67 <NA> and by digitally programming the object we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space which means that now human motions can be recorded and played back
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 223.14 229.94 <NA> and left permanently in the physical world so choreography can be taught physically over distance
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 230.02 235.31 <NA> <unk> and michael jordan 's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 235.78 243.11 <NA> students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion physics
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 243.88 247.31 <NA> and unlike computer screens or textbooks
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 246.88 252.29 <NA> this is a real tangible experience that you can touch and feel and it 's very powerful
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 252.97 254.94 <NA> and what 's more exciting
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 255.08 258.58 <NA> than just turning what 's currently in the computer physical
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 258.58 265.32 <NA> is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities laughter
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 269.45 279.67 <NA> as you can see the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 279.6 286.54 <NA> <unk> ourselves from our world today we started by talking about the boundary
JinhaLee_2013 1 JinhaLee_2013 286.95 294.32 <NA> but if we remove this boundary the only boundary left is our imagination thank you
