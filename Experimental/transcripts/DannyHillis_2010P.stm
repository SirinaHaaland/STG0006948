DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 13.06 14.66 <NA> <unk> i admit that
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 14.2 23.64 <NA> i 'm a little bit nervous here because i 'm going to say some radical things about how we should think about cancer differently to an audience that contains a lot of people who
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 23.64 24.87 <NA> know a lot more about
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 25 32.64 <NA> cancer than i do <unk> but i will also contest that i 'm not as nervous as i should be because i 'm pretty sure i 'm right about this 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 33.98 39.3 <NA> and that this in fact will be the way that we treat cancer in the future
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 39.5 43.72 <NA> <unk> in order to talk about cancer i 'm going to
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 43.54 45.4 <NA> actually have to
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 45.21 46.41 <NA> let me
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 46.4 54.97 <NA> get the big slide here first i 'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics i want to put it in perspective
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 54.98 57.94 <NA> of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 57.77 64.48 <NA> and then talk about something you haven 't heard so much about which is proteomics having explained those that will set up for what i
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 64.31 68.56 <NA> think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 68.31 74.84 <NA> so let me start with genomics <unk> it is the hot topic it is the place where we 're learning the most this is the
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 76.78 85.61 <NA> <unk> but it has its limitations and in particular you 've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 85.54 89.34 <NA> and if that were only true it would be great but it 's not it
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 89.34 96.17 <NA> 's like the parts list of your body <unk> it doesn 't say how things are connected what causes what and so on <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 95.74 104.37 <NA> so if i can make an analogy let 's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 104.96 113.7 <NA> <unk> and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder <unk> so it might be that if you went to a french restaurant
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 113.39 120.66 <NA> and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn 't have butter <unk> you could say ah i see what 's wrong with them i can make them healthy 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 120.53 128.55 <NA> and there probably are special cases of that you could certainly tell the difference between a chinese restaurant and a french restaurant by what they had in a
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 128.1 129.1 <NA> larder
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 129.78 135.19 <NA> <unk> the list of ingredients does tell you something and sometimes it tells you something that 's wrong
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 136.13 141.43 <NA> if they have tons of salt you might guess they 're using too much salt or something like that <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 141.43 150.26 <NA> but it 's limited because really to know if it 's a healthy restaurant <unk> you need to taste the food you need to know what goes on in the kitchen you need the product of all of those ingredients
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 151.3 152.39 <NA> <unk> if i
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 151.9 160.4 <NA> look at a person and i look at a person 's genome it 's the same thing the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 160.21 165.72 <NA> and so indeed there are times when we can find ingredients that [ are ] bad 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 165.72 170.58 <NA> cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 170.41 179.97 <NA> and you have a disease and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease <unk> but most things you really have to know what 's going on in the kitchen
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 180.11 187.3 <NA> <unk> because mostly sick people used to be healthy people they have the same genome <unk> so the genome really tells you much more about
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 187.09 194.46 <NA> predisposition so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 194.45 202.23 <NA> but you really for the most part can 't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person except in some of these special cases 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 202.22 204.97 <NA> so why all the big deal about
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 205.25 206.53 <NA> genetics <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 206.19 214.13 <NA> well first of all <unk> it 's because we can read it <unk> which is fantastic it is very useful in certain circumstances it
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 214.13 219.34 <NA> 's also the great theoretical triumph of biology it
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 218.97 223.06 <NA> 's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 223.08 226.31 <NA> it 's fundamental to darwin and
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 226.12 229.64 <NA> mendel and so on and so it 's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 229.6 235.25 <NA> <unk> construct <unk> so mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 235.27 243.39 <NA> and darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing <unk> and then watson and crick actually looked and
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 242.97 244.67 <NA> found one 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 244.18 253.44 <NA> so this happens in physics all the time <unk> you predict a black hole and you look out the telescope and there it is just like you said but it rarely happens in biology
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 254.96 263.53 <NA> <unk> triumph it 's so good there 's almost a religious experience in biology and darwinian evolution is really the
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 263.53 265.05 <NA> core theory <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 266.18 275.14 <NA> so the other reason it 's been very popular is because we can measure it it 's digital <unk> and in fact <unk> thanks to kary
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 275 278.89 <NA> kary mullis you can basically measure
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 278.4 282.43 <NA> your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 282.24 290.14 <NA> <unk> so for instance by measuring the genome <unk> we 've learned a lot about how we 're related to other kinds of animals
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 290.7 299.21 <NA> by the closeness of our genome <unk> or how we 're related to each other the family tree or the tree of life there 's a huge amount of
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 299.21 301.78 <NA> information about the genetics
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 301.35 304.01 <NA> just by comparing the genetic similarity
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 305.1 310.97 <NA> of course in medical application that is very useful because it 's the same kind of information
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 310.8 319.37 <NA> that the doctor gets from your family medical history except probably your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 319.21 324.72 <NA> and so by reading the genome we can find out much more about your family than you probably know <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 324.72 329.79 <NA> and so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 329.75 335.13 <NA> <unk> relatives <unk> but they may be surprising <unk> i did the 23andme thing
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 335.13 338.49 <NA> and was very surprised to discover that i am fat and bald 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 345.19 348.6 <NA> but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 348.23 349.78 <NA> but
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 349.59 351.15 <NA> mostly
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 350.99 353.65 <NA> what you need to know to find out if you 're sick
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 355.23 357.73 <NA> <unk> but it 's actually what 's going on in your body right now 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 357.69 368.32 <NA> so to do that what you really need to do <unk> you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what 's happening after the genetics and that 's what proteomics is about 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 367.95 373.52 <NA> just like genome mixes the study of all the genes proteomics is the study of all the proteins 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 373.52 379.64 <NA> and the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells actually
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 379.9 386.09 <NA> <unk> the machines that are operating that 's where the action is basically a human body
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 386.41 395.2 <NA> is a conversation going on both within the cells and between the cells and they 're telling each other to grow and to die and
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 395.2 404.94 <NA> when you 're sick something 's gone wrong with that conversation and so the trick is unfortunately we don 't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 405.29 414.63 <NA> so the problem is that measuring if you try to measure all the proteins it 's a very elaborate process it requires hundreds of steps <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 414.17 423.37 <NA> and it takes a long long time <unk> and it matters how much of the protein it is it could be very significant that a protein changed by ten percent so it 's not a nice digital thing
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 423.18 424.74 <NA> like dna and
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 425.37 430.27 <NA> <unk> problem is somebody 's in the middle of this very long stage they pause for just a moment 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 429.99 436.54 <NA> and they leave something in an enzyme for a second and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don 't work <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 436.05 440.32 <NA> and so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 440.32 446.32 <NA> people have tried very hard to do this i tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 445.98 450.13 <NA> i kept getting this call from this oncologist named david agus <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 450.06 454.97 <NA> and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 455.16 464.45 <NA> and i didn 't think this was a very likely one to call back so i kept on giving him to the delay list <unk> and then one day <unk> i get a call from
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 464.35 470.01 <NA> john doerr bill berkman and al gore on the same day saying return david agus 's phone call
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 490.4 499.93 <NA> <unk> patients dying every day because we don 't know what 's going on inside of them we have to have a window into this and he took me through specific
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 500.31 508.31 <NA> <unk> examples of when he really needed it and i realized wow this would really make a big difference if we could do it <unk> and so i said well let 's look at it applied minds
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 508.07 510.86 <NA> has enough play money that
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 510.62 517.55 <NA> we can go and just work on something without getting anybody 's funding or permission or anything <unk> so we started playing around with this 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 517.55 526.63 <NA> and as we did it we realized this was the basic problem that taking the sip of coffee that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 526.14 529.13 <NA> was to automate this process like an assembly line
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 529.93 535.76 <NA> <unk> and build robots that would measure proteomics <unk> and so we did that and
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 535.56 540.62 <NA> working with david we made a little company called applied proteomics eventually <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 540.62 548.87 <NA> which makes this robotic assembly line which in a very consistent way measures the protein and i 'll show you what that protein measurement looks like
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 551.3 554.34 <NA> <unk> what we do is we take a drop of blood
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 554.17 555.99 <NA> out of a patient <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 555.95 564.19 <NA> and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh how slippery they are 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 564.19 567.36 <NA> and we arrange them in an image <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 567.14 572.13 <NA> and so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 572.18 579.73 <NA> out of that drop of blood and we can take a different one tomorrow and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different they 'll be different after you eat or after you sleep
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 580.01 582.79 <NA> they really tell us what 's going on there 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 582.51 587.08 <NA> and so this picture which looks like a big smudge to you 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 586.65 593.8 <NA> is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 593.79 601.63 <NA> so if i zoom into that picture <unk> i can just show you what it means we sort out the proteins from left to right is the weight
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 601.38 604.97 <NA> of the fragments that we 're getting and from top to bottom
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 604.99 614.39 <NA> <unk> is how slippery they are so we 're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it and so each of these lines represents some signal that we 're getting out of a piece of a protein 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 613.96 617.64 <NA> and you can see how the lines occur in these little
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 617.28 619.76 <NA> groups of bump bump <unk> bump bump bump 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 619.63 629.64 <NA> and that 's because we 're measuring the weight so precisely that carbon comes in different isotopes so if it has an extra neutron on it <unk> we actually measure it as a different
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 629.9 631.11 <NA> as
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 630.71 640.59 <NA> a different chemical <unk> so we 're actually measuring each isotope as a different one <unk> and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is <unk> so <unk>
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 641.65 648.37 <NA> seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 648.37 653.67 <NA> and suddenly you say wow it 's way more complicated than we thought it was but we can see that stuff out there
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 653.18 654.97 <NA> and actually see features of it
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 655.07 660.01 <NA> <unk> so this is the signature out of which we 're trying to get patterns so what we do with this
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 659.55 669.13 <NA> is for example we can look at two patients one that responded to a drug and one that didn 't respond to a drug and ask what 's going on differently inside of them 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 668.91 674.93 <NA> and so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 674.75 679.37 <NA> and look at the differences so here we have alice in green and bob in red
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 680.2 687.05 <NA> <unk> we overlay them <unk> this is actual data <unk> and you can see mostly it overlaps and it 's yellow but there 's some things that
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 687.05 691.5 <NA> just alice has and some things that just bob has and if we find
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 691.31 699.26 <NA> a pattern of things of the responders to the drug <unk> we see that in the blood they have the condition
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 698.95 704.97 <NA> that allows them to respond to this drug we might not even know what this protein is <unk> but we can see it 's a marker
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 705.34 709.02 <NA> for the response to the disease <unk> so
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 710.21 715.02 <NA> this already <unk> i think is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 714.68 719.92 <NA> <unk> but i think this is actually just the beginning of
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 719.69 725.55 <NA> of how we 're going to treat cancer so let me move to cancer the thing about cancer
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 725.78 729.97 <NA> when i got into this <unk> i really knew nothing about it but working
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 729.99 738.23 <NA> <unk> with david agus i started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out and as i looked at it
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 739.91 747.16 <NA> to me it didn 't make sense how we were approaching cancer and in order to make sense of it i had to learn
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 747.09 754.97 <NA> where did this come from we 're treating cancer almost like it 's an infectious disease we 're treating it as something that got inside
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 755.02 763.4 <NA> <unk> of you that we have to kill <unk> so this is the great paradigm this is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 763.4 772.41 <NA> was the germ theory of disease <unk> so what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose that is put you into a category
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 772.23 776.67 <NA> and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 776.48 779.94 <NA> and that works great for infectious diseases so
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 780.04 788.37 <NA> if we put you in the category of you 've got syphilis we can give you penicillin we know that that works if you 've got malaria we give you quinine
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 788.09 797.22 <NA> or some derivative of it <unk> and so that 's the basic thing doctors are trained to do <unk> and it 's miraculous in the case of of
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 797.45 804.85 <NA> infectious disease how well it works and many people in this audience probably wouldn 't be alive if doctors didn 't do this
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 805.17 809.38 <NA> but now let 's apply that to systems diseases like cancer 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 809.1 817.13 <NA> the problem is that in cancer there isn 't something else that 's inside of you <unk> it 's you you 're broken
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 818.33 825.29 <NA> that conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way <unk> so how do we diagnose that conversation
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 825.4 833.34 <NA> <unk> right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body you know where did it appear <unk> and we put you in different categories
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 833.34 835.92 <NA> according to the part of the body and then we
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 835.53 845 <NA> do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer and we treat these as if they 're separate diseases
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 845 848.4 <NA> and that this way of dividing them had something to do with
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 848.17 850.05 <NA> what actually went wrong and of course
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 850.37 853.32 <NA> <unk> really doesn 't have that much to do with what went wrong
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 852.89 855.96 <NA> because cancer is a failure of the system <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 855.77 863.25 <NA> and in fact <unk> i think we 're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing i think this is the big mistake <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 862.94 869.49 <NA> i think cancer should not be a noun we should talk about cancering
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 869 874.93 <NA> as something we do not something we have and so those tumors those are symptoms of
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 876.18 884.17 <NA> <unk> and so your body is probably cancering all the time <unk> but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 884.31 891 <NA> and so to give you an idea of an analogy of what i mean by thinking of cancering as a verb <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 891 894.22 <NA> imagine we didn 't know anything about plumbing <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 894.36 898.76 <NA> and the way that we talked about it we 'd come home and we 'd find a leak
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 910.57 921.32 <NA> <unk> that 's kind of the level at which it is kitchen water well first of all we 'll go in there and we 'll mop out a lot of it <unk> and then we know that if we sprinkle drano around the kitchen that helps
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 921.58 925.11 <NA> <unk> whereas living room water it 's better to do tar on the roof
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 927.77 933.63 <NA> <unk> sounds silly but that 's basically what we do and i 'm not saying you shouldn 't mop up your water if you have cancer <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 933.23 946.06 <NA> but i 'm saying that 's not really the problem that 's the symptom of the problem <unk> what we really need to get at is the process that 's going on and that 's happening at the level of the proteonomic
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 945.88 950.17 <NA> actions happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 951.06 961.24 <NA> <unk> because normally your body is dealing with this problem all the time so your house is dealing with leaks all the time <unk> but it 's fixing them it 's draining them out and so on 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 960.81 962.36 <NA> so
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 962.14 964.72 <NA> what we need is
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 966.11 975.11 <NA> to have a causative model of what 's actually going on and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 976.81 980.67 <NA> <unk> got me invited to give a talk at national cancer institute
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 980.67 987.62 <NA> and anna barker was there <unk> and so i gave this talk and said why don 't you guys
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 987.58 991.22 <NA> do this and anna said 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 991.06 996.23 <NA> because nobody within cancer would look at it this way <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 995.74 1001.81 <NA> but what we 're going to do is we 're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1001.35 1004.97 <NA> to get together with doctors who really know about cancer
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1005.44 1007.07 <NA> and
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1006.94 1014.48 <NA> work out different programs of research so david and i applied to this program and created a consortium
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1014.48 1024.42 <NA> at usc where we 've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world from cold spring harbor
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1025.94 1029.35 <NA> <unk> austin i won 't even go through and name all the places
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1029.11 1033.74 <NA> to have a research project that will last for five years
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1033.58 1039.69 <NA> where we 're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this we 're doing it in mice first <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1039.29 1043.65 <NA> and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1043.52 1050.11 <NA> but they will die for a good cause <unk> and we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1049.9 1051.64 <NA> where we can understand when
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1054.63 1059.47 <NA> <unk> actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1059.01 1065.35 <NA> so let me just end with giving you a little picture of what i think cancer treatment will be like in the future <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1065.25 1073.99 <NA> so i think eventually once we have one of these models for people which we 'll get eventually i mean our group won 't get all the way there but
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1073.89 1079.67 <NA> eventually we 'll have a very good computer model sort of like a global climate model for weather
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1080.02 1081.19 <NA> <unk> lots of different
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1081.2 1090.59 <NA> information about what 's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales <unk> and so we will simulate in that model
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1090.46 1093.83 <NA> for your particular cancer
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1093.4 1101.24 <NA> and this also will be for als or any kind of system neurodegenerative neurodegenerative diseases things like that
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1101.24 1103.25 <NA> we will simulate
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1103.21 1104.94 <NA> specifically you
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1104.93 1109.56 <NA> <unk> not just a generic person but what 's actually going on inside you 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1109.1 1119.26 <NA> and in that simulation what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments and it might be very gentle treatments very small amounts of drugs it might
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1119.02 1122.19 <NA> be things like don 't eat that day or
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1121.85 1125.32 <NA> give them a little chemotherapy maybe a little radiation
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1126.03 1132.19 <NA> <unk> do surgery sometimes and so on but design a program of treatments specifically for you and <unk>
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1133.19 1136.18 <NA> help your body guide
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1136.11 1140.32 <NA> back to health guide your body back to health because your body
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1140.32 1150.05 <NA> will will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong we put it in the equivalent of splints <unk> and so your body basically has
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1150 1154.65 <NA> <unk> lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer and we just have to prop those up in the right way
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1154.47 1156.83 <NA> and get them to do the job <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1156.49 1165.86 <NA> and so i believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future it 's going to require a lot of work a lot of research there
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1165.4 1169.94 <NA> will be many teams like like our team that that work on this <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1169.51 1171.8 <NA> but i think eventually 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1171.52 1177.86 <NA> we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer <unk> 
DannyHillis_2010P 1 DannyHillis_2010P 1177.67 1179.18 <NA> so
