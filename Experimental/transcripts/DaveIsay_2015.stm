DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 965.13 969.68 <NA> so here is my wish that you

DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 973.9 976.54 <NA> and bring it to the world
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 976.08 979.82 <NA> so that anyone anywhere can easily record a
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 979.75 988.25 <NA> <unk> meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history how are we going to do that with
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 988.63 990.23 <NA> this 
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 990.22 1001.66 <NA> we 're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world will have access to one of these <unk> and it has powers i never could have imagined eleven years ago when i started storycorps 
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1001.23 1003.34 <NA> it has a microphone

DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1005.25 1013.31 <NA> and it can send audio files those are the key ingredients so the first part of the wish is already underway 
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1013.31 1024.54 <NA> over the past couple of months the team at storycorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring storycorps out of our booths so that it can be experienced by anyone

DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1028.13 1040.5 <NA> <unk> storycorps has always been two people and a facilitator helping them record their conversation which is preserved forever <unk> but at this very moment we 're releasing a public beta version of the storycorps app 
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1040.22 1052.2 <NA> the app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the storycorps interview process helps you pick questions and gives you all the tips you need to record a meaningful storycorps interview 
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1052.2 1054.97 <NA> and then with one tap upload it to our

DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1063.39 1073.57 <NA> to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across america and around the world so that instead of recording thousands of storycorps interviews a year we could <unk>

DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1201.3 1205.03 <NA> <unk> i thought i couldn 't believe in storycorps any more deeply than i did 
DaveIsay_2015 1 DaveIsay_2015 1205.02 1211.49 <NA> but it was at that moment that i fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings
