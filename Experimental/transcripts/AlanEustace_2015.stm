AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 189.93 197.14 <NA> and what was amazing to me about that experience is that taber said yes <unk> i think we can build a stratospheric suit <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 196.93 204.46 <NA> and more than that come down tomorrow and let 's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 205.11 214.94 <NA> they did something which i think is important <unk> which is they took the analogy of scuba diving <unk> so in scuba diving <unk> you have a

AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 273.29 279.94 <NA> the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device the suit itself can protect me from the

AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 294.15 296.84 <NA> this system would still protect me from the
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 296.66 304.97 <NA> from the low pressure of space the main advantage of this system is weight and complexity <unk> so the system weighs about
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 304.99 310.97 <NA> <unk> five hundred pounds and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere <unk> they used a capsule <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 310.97 319.44 <NA> and to do a capsule there 's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it <unk> and it weighed about three thousand pounds and to raise three thousand pounds
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 319.21 324.81 <NA> to an altitude of one hundred and thirty five thousand feet which was my target altitude it would have taken a

AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 330.35 334.05 <NA> because i only weighed five hundred pounds in this system 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 334.05 341.85 <NA> we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 341.42 344.94 <NA> than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 345.05 354.43 <NA> so with that i want to take you to roswell new mexico on october twenty four we had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night and

AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 392.95 396.26 <NA> <unk> van to go to the launch pad but i got a front loader 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 397.54 399.96 <NA> you can see the top you can see the balloon
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 400.31 402.33 <NA> <unk> that 's where the helium is 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 404.12 408.93 <NA> this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for fifteen miles

AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 539.8 543.47 <NA> <unk> there 's the balloon going by <unk> fully inflated at this point <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 544.24 551.46 <NA> and there you can see a drogue parachute which i 'll demonstrate in just a second because that 's really important there 's the balloon going by a second time
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 560.69 564.06 <NA> right now i 'm about at the speed of sound <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 564.14 573.28 <NA> there 's nothing for me to tell it 's the speed of sound <unk> and very soon i will actually be as fast as i ever get eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 595.47 604.43 <NA> <unk> down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there at this point i 'm very happy that there 's a parachute out

AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 610.36 622.08 <NA> the really nice thing about this is the moment i opened i had a close of friend of mine blikkies my parachute guy he flew in another airplane <unk> and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 622.08 625.08 <NA> he was my wingman on the descent
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 625.58 631.47 <NA> <unk> this is my landing but it 's probably more properly called a crash 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 634.58 638.47 <NA> i hate to admit it but this wasn 't even close to my worst landing
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 671.61 675.02 <NA> <unk> you one thing that you might not have seen in that video <unk> but one
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 675.04 682.55 <NA> <unk> the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release and
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 682.45 688.31 <NA> what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 688.31 693.8 <NA> and i 'll show you one of those right now <unk> if any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving <unk>

AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 702.96 710.52 <NA> so it 's very easy for this to just turn right around you and before you know it you can be tangled up or spinning <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 710.81 714.03 <NA> or you can release this drogue late 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 713.57 722.37 <NA> in which case what happens is you 're going down at eight hundred miles an hour and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 722.93 725.02 <NA> but the guys at united parachute
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 725.67 732.94 <NA> <unk> came up with this idea and it was a roll that looks like that but watch what happens when i pull it out <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 733.08 735.58 <NA> it 's forming a pipe <unk> 
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 736.29 739.51 <NA> this pipe is so solid

AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 810.17 816.49 <NA> put up with it was because i came back incredibly happy after each of the two hundred and fifty tests
AlanEustace_2015 1 AlanEustace_2015 816.15 824.99 <NA> and she didn 't want to take that away from me <unk> so i want to close with a story my daughter katelyn <unk> my 15 year old she and i were in the car
