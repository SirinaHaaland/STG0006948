AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 13.15 17.74 <NA> <unk> actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 17.74 25.08 <NA> the fact is that we 're living longer <unk> medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer and the problem is as we
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 26.21 30.67 <NA> <unk> our organs tend to fail more and so currently
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 30.43 41.85 <NA> there are not enough organs to go around in fact in the last ten years the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled while in the same time the actual number of transplants has barely gone up so
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 41.84 44.61 <NA> this is now a public health crisis 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 44.12 53.92 <NA> so that 's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine it really involves many different areas you can use actually scaffolds biomaterials
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 53.76 54.94 <NA> they 're like the piece of your
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 54.9 62.27 <NA> <unk> blouse or your shirt but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 62.27 69.7 <NA> or we can use cells alone <unk> either your very own cells or different stem cell populations 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 69.3 75.13 <NA> or we can use both we can use actually biomaterials and the cells together <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 74.76 77.86 <NA> and that 's where the field is today <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 77.55 79.85 <NA> but it 's actually not a new field
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 79.86 83.09 <NA> interestingly this is a book that was published back in <unk>
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 85.12 94.7 <NA> 's titled the culture of organs the first author alexis carrel a nobel prize winner he actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels <unk>
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 94.65 100.62 <NA> and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by alexis <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 105.32 114.85 <NA> that 's the same charles lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with alexis at the rockefeller institute in new york
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 114.85 124.99 <NA> in the area of the culture of organs <unk> so if the field 's been around for so long why so few clinical advances and that really has to do to many different challenges but if i were to point to three challenges
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 125.31 134.89 <NA> <unk> the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time and many advances now we can do that fairly readily <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 134.66 140.23 <NA> the second challenge was cells we could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 140.23 153.83 <NA> over the last twenty years we 've basically tackled that many scientists can now grow many different types of cells <unk> plus we have stem cells but even now two thousand and eleven <unk> there 's still certain cells that we just can 't grow from the patient
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 154.84 160.16 <NA> <unk> cells <unk> nerve cells <unk> pancreatic cells we still can 't grow them even today 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 159.97 170.27 <NA> and the third challenge is vascularity <unk> the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 170.05 175.02 <NA> so we can actually use biomaterials now this is actually a biomaterial we can weave them
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 175.04 180.09 <NA> <unk> knit them or we can make them like you see here this is actually like a cotton candy machine 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 179.78 189.84 <NA> you saw the spray going in that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure this tubularized structure which is a biomaterial that we can then use <unk>
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 189.79 195.27 <NA> to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 201.81 211.18 <NA> <unk> and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient 's structure 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 210.81 224.96 <NA> what we did was we actually used the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge if you will and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue <unk> and you see that patient now six months
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 226.36 232.82 <NA> <unk> showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 232.9 246.38 <NA> we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and we can drive them to become heart cells and they start beating in culture 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 246.43 254.85 <NA> so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to do and they start beating together now today many clinical trials are using different kinds of
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 255.11 260.46 <NA> <unk> cells for heart disease <unk> so that 's actually now in patients 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 260.27 272.59 <NA> or if we 're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures we can then use the patient 's own cells or some cell population and the biomaterials the scaffolds <unk> together <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 272.59 276.34 <NA> so the concept here so if you do have a deceased
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 276.18 279.94 <NA> or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue less than
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 279.9 282.88 <NA> <unk> half the size of a postage stamp <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 282.48 290.92 <NA> we then tease the cells apart <unk> we grow the cells outside the body <unk> we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 290.43 300.41 <NA> looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 300.24 304.52 <NA> very much like baking a layer cake if you will <unk> we then place it in an
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 305.05 311.63 <NA> <unk> device <unk> and we 're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a heart valve
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 311.26 313.79 <NA> that we 've engineered <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 313.33 323.6 <NA> and you can see here we have the structure of the heart valve and we 've seeded that with cells <unk> and then we exercise it so you see the leaflets opening and closing
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 323.32 328.97 <NA> of this heart valve that 's currently being used experimentally
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 328.72 329.97 <NA> to try to get it
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 330.07 333.9 <NA> to to further studies <unk> another
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 333.41 344.13 <NA> technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders we actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient less than half the size of a postage stamp <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 343.7 351.54 <NA> we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient 's own cells two different cell types 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 351.26 353.14 <NA> we then put it in this
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 355.08 365.32 <NA> <unk> as the human body thirty seven degrees centigrade ninety five percent oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we 're able to implant back into the patient 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 364.83 369.25 <NA> for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use <unk>
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 370.35 379.94 <NA> <unk> analysis but we actually created these biomaterials by hand <unk> but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 380.04 381.8 <NA> some type of
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 382.3 389.87 <NA> technologies where for solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 389.47 397.34 <NA> <unk> as you know a lot of organs are actually discarded not used so we can take these liver structures which are not going to be used <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 397.34 401.19 <NA> and we then put them in a washing machine like structure
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 401.01 404.94 <NA> that will allow the cells to be washed away <unk> two weeks later you have
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 405.07 413.22 <NA> something that looks like a liver <unk> you can hold it like a liver <unk> but it has no cells it 's just a skeleton of the liver <unk> and we then can <unk>
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 414.38 424.93 <NA> <unk> liver with cells <unk> preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient 's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 426.06 435.01 <NA> <unk> with the liver cells and we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 436.23 443.26 <NA> another technology that we 've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 443.25 446.89 <NA> but instead of using ink we 're using cells <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 446.91 453.47 <NA> and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about forty minutes to print this structure and there 's
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 455.02 462 <NA> <unk> that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through and then finally you 're able to get that structure out 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 462 469.73 <NA> you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that i 'm going to show you <unk>
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 469.3 479.97 <NA> in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here <unk> that was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 480.1 482.94 <NA> <unk> another
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 482.6 494.88 <NA> more advanced technology we 're looking at right now our next generation of technologies are more sophisticated printers this particular printer we 're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 494.48 497.01 <NA> so what you see here
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 497.54 499.42 <NA> i know it sounds funny but
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 500.64 511.15 <NA> <unk> that 's the way it works because in reality <unk> what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically like a flatbed scanner <unk>
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 511.1 518.89 <NA> that 's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 529.9 531.65 <NA> <unk> scanning the wound <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 531.73 538.79 <NA> once it 's scanned it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 538.79 543.11 <NA> and now you 're going to see here a demo of this actually being done
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 542.62 554.94 <NA> in a in a representative wound and we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material so once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be <unk> and this is actually new technology still
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 555.16 556.8 <NA> under development <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 557.36 564.54 <NA> we 're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs i
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 564.14 572.97 <NA> don 't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 572.69 579.97 <NA> patients are dying every day because we don 't have enough of those organs to go around <unk> so this is more challenging
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 580.04 585.88 <NA> large organ <unk> vascular a lot of blood vessel supply a lot of cells present <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 585.88 590.47 <NA> so the strategy here is this is actually a ct scan an x ray
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 589.98 599.48 <NA> and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient 's own kidneys 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 599.48 604.97 <NA> we then are able to actually image those do three hundred and sixty degree rotation
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 604.93 614.3 <NA> <unk> to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics <unk> and we then are able to actually take this information
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 613.84 621.38 <NA> and then scan this in a printing computerized form so we go layer by layer through the organ <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 621.37 629.88 <NA> analyzing each layer as we go through the organ <unk> and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 629.87 637.68 <NA> <unk> and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 637.4 644.49 <NA> and this actually shows that printing in fact <unk> we actually have the printer right here <unk> so
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 644.18 647.85 <NA> while we 've been talking today 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 647.75 654.85 <NA> you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage that 's actually the actual printer right now <unk> and that 's been
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 654.78 658.15 <NA> <unk> printing this kidney structure that you see here
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 658.05 663.37 <NA> <unk> it takes about seven hours to print a kidney so this is about three hours into it now 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 663.37 669.61 <NA> and <unk> dr kang 's going to walk onstage right now and we 're actually going to show you one of these kidneys
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 669.21 671.95 <NA> that we printed a little bit earlier today <unk> 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 675.24 677.06 <NA> put a pair of gloves here

AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 692.98 699.9 <NA> so these gloves are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 716.63 718.68 <NA> <unk> a little bit of consistency to it 
AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 720.47 724.96 <NA> this is dr kang who 's been working with us on this project and part

AnthonyAtala_2011 1 AnthonyAtala_2011 967.14 975.29 <NA> so luke you go to your communications professors you 're majoring in communications and you ask them for permission to come to ted which might have a little bit to do with communications
