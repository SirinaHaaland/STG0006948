DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 411.67 423.39 <NA> component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format you can break away from for example the monolithic one hour lecture 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 423.38 424.99 <NA> you can break up the material
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 425 431.8 <NA> for example into these short modular units of eight to twelve minutes <unk> each of which represents a coherent concept 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 431.64 438.22 <NA> students can traverse this material in different ways depending on their background their skills or their interests 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 438.22 445.78 <NA> so for example <unk> some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have

DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 451.33 454.64 <NA> <unk> so this format allows us to break away from <unk>
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 456.01 460.85 <NA> <unk> model of education and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 461.2 467.24 <NA> of course we all know as educators that students don 't learn by sitting and passively watching videos 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 466.87 475.1 <NA> perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 476.24 477.7 <NA> <unk> order to really understand it 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 477.49 488.04 <NA> there 's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this this one that appeared in science last year for example <unk> demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice where students are just <unk>

DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 563.35 570.87 <NA> and so the lecture moves on before really most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked here 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 570.74 574.62 <NA> every single student has to engage with the material and
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 574.76 579.97 <NA> of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story one needs to build in much more
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 579.9 591.25 <NA> <unk> meaningful practice questions <unk> and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions now how do you grade the work of one hundred thousand students if you do not have ten thousand tas

DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 626.33 629.85 <NA> this is from stanford 's computer science one hundred and one class and the students are supposed to

DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 666.09 674.38 <NA> so we tried to convince for example some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy that didn 't go over really well <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 674.94 679.97 <NA> so we had to come up with a different solution and the solution we ended up using is peer grading
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 680.19 689.93 <NA> it turns out that previous studies show like this one by saddler and good that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades

DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 695.23 700.02 <NA> <unk> on the y axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher assigned grade on the x axis what
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 700 709.08 <NA> 's even more surprising is that self grades where the students grade their own work critically so long as you incentivize them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 708.92 720.87 <NA> are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades <unk> and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale and is also a useful learning strategy for the students because they actually learn from the experience <unk>

DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 769.04 779.97 <NA> and the really amazing thing is because there were so many students it means that even if a student posed a question at three o 'clock in the morning somewhere around the world there would be somebody who was awake

DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 897.46 904.19 <NA> this is a distribution of wrong answers to one of andrew 's assignments the answers happen to be pairs of numbers so you can draw them on this
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 905.13 909.41 <NA> each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 909.01 916.49 <NA> the big cross at the top left is where two thousand students gave the exact same wrong answer <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 916.54 926.21 <NA> now if two students in a class of one hundred give the same wrong answer <unk> you would never notice <unk> but when two thousand students give the same wrong answer it 's kind of hard to miss 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 926.05 929.7 <NA> so andrew and his students went in looked at some of those assignments
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 929.69 940.65 <NA> <unk> understood the root cause of the misconception <unk> and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 940.65 948.96 <NA> which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively <unk>
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 948.89 954.76 <NA> so this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 954.72 955.78 <NA> <unk> numbers <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 956.46 966.22 <NA> personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30 year old problem 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 965.76 968.35 <NA> educational researcher benjamin bloom <unk>
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 969.5 974.74 <NA> posed what 's called the two sigma problem <unk> which he observed by studying three populations <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 974.4 979.91 <NA> the first is the population that studied in a lecture based classroom <unk> the second is a
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 979.84 987.89 <NA> <unk> population of students that studied using a standard lecture based classroom <unk> but with a mastery based approach <unk> so the students couldn 't move on to the next topic before
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 987.72 996.95 <NA> demonstrating mastery of the previous one <unk> and finally <unk> there was a population of students that were taught in a one on one instruction using a tutor 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 996.88 1002.96 <NA> the mastery based population was a full standard deviation or sigma in achievement scores better than the
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1005.02 1008.81 <NA> <unk> and the individual tutoring gives you two sigma improvement in performance 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1008.81 1020.24 <NA> to understand what that means <unk> let 's look at the lecture based classroom and let 's pick the median performance as a threshold <unk> so in a lecture based class half the students are above that level and half are below 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1020.02 1027.29 <NA> in the individual tutoring instruction ninety eight percent of the students are going to be above that threshold <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1027.1 1029.55 <NA> imagine if we could teach so that
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1029.92 1033.12 <NA> ninety eight percent of our students would be above average <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1033.62 1036.93 <NA> hence the two sigma problem <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1036.44 1042.13 <NA> because we cannot afford as a society to provide every student with an individual human tutor <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1042.13 1054.34 <NA> but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone <unk> so the question is how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph from the blue curve to the right side with the green curve
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1054.99 1060.82 <NA> <unk> mastery is easy to achieve using a computer because a computer doesn 't get tired of showing you the same video five times <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1061.26 1067.9 <NA> and it doesn 't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times we 've seen that in many of the examples that i 've shown you 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1067.53 1078.26 <NA> and even personalization is something that we 're starting to see the beginnings of whether it 's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we 've shown you 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1078.26 1079.97 <NA> so the goal here
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1079.9 1086.36 <NA> <unk> is to try and push <unk> and see how far we can get towards the green curve <unk> so <unk> if this is
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1086.16 1089.6 <NA> so great are universities now obsolete 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1089.83 1099.3 <NA> well mark twain certainly thought so he said that college is a place where a professor 's lecture notes go straight to the students ' lecture notes <unk> without passing through the brains of either 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1103.58 1105.87 <NA> <unk> i beg to differ with mark twain though 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1105.95 1114.13 <NA> i think what he was complaining about is not is not universities but rather the lecture based format that so many universities spend so much time on 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1113.92 1121.53 <NA> so let 's go back even further to plutarch who said that the mind is not a vessel that needs filling but wood that needs igniting 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1121.53 1124.96 <NA> and maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1125.37 1135.88 <NA> <unk> minds with content by lecturing at them and more time igniting their creativity their imagination and their problem solving skills by actually talking with them <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1135.48 1140.98 <NA> so how do we do that we do that by doing active learning in the classroom <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1140.58 1149.96 <NA> so there 's been many studies including this one that show that if you use active learning <unk> interacting with your students in the classroom <unk> performance improves on every single
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1150.37 1159.42 <NA> <unk> on attendance on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test you can see for example that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1159.42 1163.34 <NA> so maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1163.87 1171.89 <NA> so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free <unk> what would that do 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1171.55 1175.11 <NA> three things <unk> first it would establish education
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1175.19 1180.43 <NA> <unk> fundamental human right where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1180.25 1185.73 <NA> could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves their families and their communities 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1185.48 1199.99 <NA> second it would enable lifelong learning it 's a shame that for so many people learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college by having this amazing content be available we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted whether
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1200 1203.14 <NA> 's just to expand our minds or it 's to change our lives <unk> 
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1202.92 1212.69 <NA> and finally this would enable a wave of innovation <unk> because amazing talent can be found anywhere maybe the next albert einstein or the next steve jobs
DaphneKoller_2012G 1 DaphneKoller_2012G 1212.64 1222.59 <NA> <unk> is living somewhere in a remote village in africa <unk> and if we could offer that person an education they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us <unk>
