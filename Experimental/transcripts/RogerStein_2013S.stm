RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 63.36 68.8 <NA> that happened to be specially formulated and very good for his particular kind of cancer there are over two hundred kinds of cancer 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 70.17 74.42 <NA> and what i want to talk about today is how we can help more people like my dad
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 76.18 78.53 <NA> <unk> change the way we think about raising money

RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 91.15 99.24 <NA> and we were talking about cancer and andrew had been doing his own bits of research and one of the things that he had been told and that he 'd learned from

RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 101.74 104.97 <NA> was that there 's actually a big bottleneck <unk> it 's very difficult

RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 113.3 120.42 <NA> so andrew asked me if i 'd want to maybe work with him a bit work on some of the math and the analytics and see if we could figure out something we could do
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 121.49 124.84 <NA> <unk> now i 'm not a scientist you know i don 't know how to build a drug

RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 134.63 143.29 <NA> make a cancer drug <unk> but we know a little bit about risk mitigation and a little bit about financial engineering and so we started thinking what could we do i 'm
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 143.55 147.23 <NA> going to tell you about some work we 've been doing over the last couple years
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 146.99 149.89 <NA> that we think could fundamentally change the way
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 149.67 154.61 <NA> research for cancer and lots of other things gets done we want to let the
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 154.81 163.64 <NA> <unk> research drive the funding not the other way around so in order to get started let me tell you how you get a drug financed <unk> imagine that you 're in your lab
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 163.3 172.01 <NA> you 're a scientist you 're not like me <unk> and you 've developed a new new compound that you think might be therapeutic for for somebody with cancer well 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 171.7 175.11 <NA> what you do is <unk> you test in animals you test in test
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 175.85 184.14 <NA> <unk> but there 's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside and in order to get from the bench the lab to the bedside to the patients <unk> you 've got to get the drug tested 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 184.04 186.96 <NA> and the way the drug gets tested is through a series of 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 186.96 194.07 <NA> basically experiments through these large they 're called trials that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 193.91 199.84 <NA> so the fda has a very specific protocol in the first phase of this testing which is called testing for
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 202.59 208.09 <NA> <unk> in the first phase you give the drug to healthy people and you see if it actually makes them sick in other
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 208.08 212.09 <NA> words are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does it 's not
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 212.09 218.87 <NA> going to be worth it does it cause heart attacks kill people liver failure and it turns out that 's a pretty high hurdle 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 218.65 221.56 <NA> about a third of all drugs drop out at that point <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 221.13 224.17 <NA> in the next phase you test to see if the drug 's effective <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 223.92 225.08 <NA> and
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 226.87 236.12 <NA> <unk> makes them better and that 's also a higher hurdle people drop out and in the third phase you test it on a very large sample and you 're trying to determine what the right dose is 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 235.9 239.24 <NA> is it better than what 's available today if not then why build it 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 239.32 246.92 <NA> when you 're done with all that what you have is a very small percentage of drugs that start the process actually come out the other side 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 246.82 250.23 <NA> so those blue bottles those blue bottles save lives
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 251 254.1 <NA> <unk> and they 're also worth billions <unk> sometimes billions a year <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 254.27 258.12 <NA> so now here 's a question if i were to ask you 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 258.11 263.49 <NA> for example to make a one time investment of say two hundred million dollars
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 263.15 270.24 <NA> to buy one of those bottles <unk> so two hundred million dollars up front one time to buy one of those bottles i won 't tell you which one it is and
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 269.78 273.48 <NA> in ten years i 'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones does
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 273.77 275.05 <NA> that sound like a good
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 277.62 284.74 <NA> <unk> and of course it 's a very very risky trial position and that 's why it 's very hard to get funding but to a first approximation that 's actually the proposal <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 284.31 288.73 <NA> you have to fund these things from the early stages on it takes a long time <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 288.69 297.73 <NA> so andrew said to me he said what if we stop thinking about these as drugs what if we start thinking about them as financial assets 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 297.33 299.96 <NA> they 've got really weird payoff structures and all that but
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 300 307.28 <NA> 's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them let 's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 307.03 309.47 <NA> work as financial assets 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 309.85 312.26 <NA> let 's create a giant fund <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 311.8 320.43 <NA> in finance we know what to do with assets that are risky you put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns <unk> so we did some math and it turned out you could make this work <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 320.43 329.4 <NA> but in order to make it work you need about eighty to one hundred and fifty drugs now the good news is there 's plenty of drugs that are waiting to be tested <unk> we 've been told that there 's a backlog
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 330.05 332.31 <NA> <unk> about twenty years of drugs

RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 334.31 343.03 <NA> in fact that early stage of the funding process that phase i and preclinical stuff <unk> that 's actually in the industry called the valley of death because it 's where drugs go to die <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 343.03 348.57 <NA> it 's very hard to for them to get through there and of course if you can 't get through there you can 't get to the the later stages <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 348.77 350.02 <NA> so we did this math
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 357 360.76 <NA> <unk> that 's a fund of about three to fifteen billion dollars <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 361.35 365.62 <NA> so we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 365.37 373.78 <NA> we got rid of the risk but now we need a lot of capital and you can only get that kind of capital in the capital markets <unk> venture capitalists and philanthropies don 't have it <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 373.65 378.98 <NA> but we have to figure out how to get people in the capital markets who traditionally don 't invest in this to want to invest in this stuff
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 380.14 384.89 <NA> <unk> financial engineering was helpful here <unk> imagine the megafund starts empty and
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 384.67 390.8 <NA> what it does is it issues some debt and some equity and that generates cash flow 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 390.46 394.43 <NA> that cash flow is used then to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 394 402.5 <NA> and those drugs start working their way through that approval process <unk> and each time they go through a phase of approval they gain value <unk> most of them don 't make it <unk> but a few of them do <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 402.5 404.94 <NA> and with the ones that gain value <unk> you can sell some
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 405.44 412.23 <NA> and when you sell them you have money to pay the interest on those bonds but also to fund the next round of trials it 's almost self funding 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 412.49 415.32 <NA> you do that for the course of the transaction
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 415.07 418.68 <NA> and when you 're done <unk> you liquidate the portfolio pay back the bonds and you can
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 418.51 426.66 <NA> give the equity holders a nice return that was the theory <unk> and we talked about it we did a bunch of experiments and then we said let 's really try to test it <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 426.98 429.97 <NA> we spent the next two years doing research

RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 455.25 462.2 <NA> <unk> it was feasible to structure that fund such that when you were done structuring it you could actually produce low risk bonds

RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 467.85 477.77 <NA> that would give equity holders about a twelve percent return now those returns aren 't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist they want to make those big bets and get those billion dollar payoffs <unk> 
RogerStein_2013S 1 RogerStein_2013S 477.77 479.91 <NA> but it turns out there are lots of other folks that would be
