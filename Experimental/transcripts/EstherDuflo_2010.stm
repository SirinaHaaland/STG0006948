EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 278.6 279.97 <NA> and a third question
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 280.19 284.83 <NA> education maybe that 's the solution maybe we should send kids to school but how do you do that

EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 291.06 299.78 <NA> so here is the thing <unk> i cannot answer the big question <unk> whether aid did any good or not but these three questions <unk> i can answer them <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 305.23 310.85 <NA> <unk> and in the 20th century randomized controlled trials have revolutionized medicine

EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 332.69 337.32 <NA> by knowing what works what doesn 't work and why 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 337.28 340.53 <NA> and i 'll give you some examples with those three questions <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 340.4 345.9 <NA> so i start with immunization here 's udaipur district rajasthan <unk> beautiful <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 345.68 354.31 <NA> well when i started working there about one percent of children were fully immunized <unk> that 's bad <unk> but there are places like that
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 355.5 369.25 <NA> <unk> now it 's not because the vaccines are not there they are there and they are free and it 's not because parents do not care about their kids the same child that is not immunized against measles <unk> if they do get measles parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 369.18 374.99 <NA> so you get these empty village <unk> subcenters and crowded hospitals so what is the problem
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 375.58 384.38 <NA> <unk> part of the problem surely is people do not fully understand <unk> after all in this country as well <unk> all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 384.73 389.72 <NA> so if that 's the case that 's difficult <unk> because persuasion is really difficult <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 389.74 395.69 <NA> but maybe there is another problem as well <unk> it 's going from intention to action <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 395.2 404.88 <NA> imagine you are a mother in udaipur district <unk> rajasthan you have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized <unk> and maybe when you get there what you find is this the subcenter is closed
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 404.93 413.04 <NA> <unk> you have to come back and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do you will always tend to postpone and postpone and eventually it gets too late well 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 412.97 418.83 <NA> if that 's the problem <unk> then that 's much easier because a we can make it easy 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 418.46 424.86 <NA> and b we can maybe give people a reason to act today rather than wait till tomorrow 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 425.46 429.01 <NA> <unk> so these are simple ideas but we didn 't know so let 's try them <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 428.61 434.57 <NA> so what we did is we did a randomized controlled trial in one hundred and thirty four villages in udaipur districts 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 434.57 444.86 <NA> so the blue dots are selected randomly we made it easy i 'll tell you how in a moment in the red dots <unk> we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 444.66 448.06 <NA> the white dots are comparisons <unk> nothing changed <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 448.08 454.91 <NA> so we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized <unk> and then you
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 454.93 461.54 <NA> <unk> make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 461.26 467.78 <NA> now a kilo of lentils is tiny <unk> it 's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don 't want to do 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 467.5 474.62 <NA> on the other hand if your problem is you tend to postpone <unk> then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 477.62 480.22 <NA> <unk> everything is the same that 's the beauty of randomization
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 482.48 490.89 <NA> the camp just having the camp increases immunization from six percent to seventeen percent that 's full immunization <unk> that 's not bad <unk> that 's a good improvement 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 490.43 496.44 <NA> add the lentils and you reach to thirty eight percent so here you 've got your answer 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 496.04 499.96 <NA> make it easy and give a kilo of lentils you multiply immunization rate
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 502.29 513.61 <NA> <unk> but it 's not sustainable we cannot keep giving lentils to people well it turns out it 's wrong economics because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them <unk> since you have to pay for the nurse anyway <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 513.12 518.2 <NA> the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don 't 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 518.94 524.02 <NA> how about bed nets <unk> should you give them for free or should you ask people to pay for them <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 523.95 529.13 <NA> so the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions one is
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 530.05 538.94 <NA> <unk> must pay for a bed net are they going to purchase them <unk> the second one is if i give bed nets for free are people going to use them <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 538.84 549.96 <NA> and the third one is do free bed nets discourage future purchase the third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts <unk> it might destroy markets to distribute free bed
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 551.51 556.44 <NA> <unk> now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 556.01 563.82 <NA> it 's more ideological than practical <unk> but it turns out it 's an easy question we can know the answer to this question we can just run an experiment <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 563.45 568.74 <NA> and many experiments have been run and they all have the same results so i 'm just going to talk to you about one 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 568.49 575.08 <NA> and this one that was in kenya they went around and distributed to people vouchers discount vouchers
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 575.31 579.52 <NA> <unk> so people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 579.3 586.48 <NA> and some people get one hundred percent discount and some people get twenty percent discounts and some people get fifty percent discount etc 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 586.41 589.03 <NA> and now we can see what happens 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 588.54 590.83 <NA> so how about the purchasing <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 590.34 604.94 <NA> well what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets <unk> the coverage rate really falls down a lot so even with partial subsidy three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net and now you only have twenty percent of the people with
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 604.96 607.91 <NA> <unk> bed nets <unk> you lose the health immunity that 's not great <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 607.78 610.2 <NA> second thing is how about the use 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 610.2 618.92 <NA> well the good news is people if they have the bed nets <unk> will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it if they get it for free they use it if they have to pay for it they use it <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 619.12 625.05 <NA> how about the long term <unk> in the long term people who got the free bed nets
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 625.16 629.91 <NA> <unk> one year later were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars <unk> 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 629.48 637.2 <NA> and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn 't get a free one 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 636.71 643.2 <NA> so people do not get used to handouts they get used to nets <unk> maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 644.33 649.71 <NA> so that 's for bed nets so you will think that 's great you know how to immunize kids you know how to give bed nets 
EstherDuflo_2010 1 EstherDuflo_2010 649.46 654.85 <NA> but what politicians need is a range of options they need to know out of
