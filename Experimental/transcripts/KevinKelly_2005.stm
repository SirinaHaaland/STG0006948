KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 129.75 137.61 <NA> <unk> think gets into a little bit of of our current idea <unk> but i was interested in another definition of technology <unk> something again that went back
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 137.62 143.38 <NA> to something more fundamental something that was deeper and
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 144.21 150.05 <NA> as i struggled to to understand that i came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to to work

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 160.89 168.35 <NA> this question <unk> what does technology want <unk> and by that i don 't mean does it want chocolate or vanilla 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 168.61 175.41 <NA> by what it wants i mean <unk> what are its inherent trends and biases what are its tendencies
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 176.42 182.07 <NA> <unk> one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms which we 've heard a lot about

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 454.99 456.66 <NA> <unk> the second thing is is we see
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 456.45 464.51 <NA> diversity <unk> we also see specialization we see the movement from a general purpose cell to the more specific and
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 464.51 468.89 <NA> specialized and we see a drift towards complexity

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 583.39 587.9 <NA> and thirdly the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 587.45 593.05 <NA> at this point a cliche and i 'm happy to say i was partly responsible for that cliche
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 593.05 599.68 <NA> that machines are becoming biological but that 's pretty evident so the major trends in
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 599.79 604.88 <NA> technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 604.93 614.19 <NA> <unk> the same drives that we see towards ubiquity towards diversity towards socialization <unk> towards complexity that is maybe not a big surprise
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 614.19 615.47 <NA> because if we
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 615.16 622.7 <NA> map out say the evolution of of armor <unk> you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary type cladistic tree <unk> 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 623.08 629.91 <NA> i suggest that in fact technology is the seventh kingdom of life <unk> that its operations and how it

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 631.7 633.39 <NA> that we can think of it

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 645.86 650.05 <NA> we could actually approach technology in this way <unk> this is niles eldredge 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 651.54 660.25 <NA> <unk> with stephen jay gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium <unk> but as a sideline he happens to collect cornets he has one of the world 's largest collections

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 676.03 679.82 <NA> is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom those
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 679.78 681.11 <NA> <unk> indicate
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 680.77 682.52 <NA> basically

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 697.92 699.87 <NA> that you can actually look at
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 700 709 <NA> <unk> this tree and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system in fact this idea
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 709 713.37 <NA> of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 712.91 717.84 <NA> what happens with old technology and it turns out that in fact <unk> 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 717.47 724.99 <NA> technologies don 't die <unk> so i suggested this to an historian of science and he said well what about you know come on what about steam
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 731.76 732.83 <NA> <unk> so around

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 754.87 756.83 <NA> <unk> think about
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 756.76 767.3 <NA> well maybe that 's just a random sample maybe i should do this sort of in a more conservative way so i took the great big one thousand eight hundred and ninety five montgomery ward 's catalog <unk>
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 767.25 778.07 <NA> and i randomly went through it and i took a page not quite a random page i took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made <unk> but i took this page
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 779.66 780.84 <NA> <unk> things
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 780.38 789.72 <NA> are still being made and not antiques <unk> i want to know how many of these things are still in production <unk> and the answer is all of them

KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 793.01 799.93 <NA> so you 've got corn shellers i don 't know who needs a corn sheller be it corn shellers you 've
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 801.24 812.53 <NA> <unk> you 've got fan mills all these things and these are not again antiques these are you can order these you can go to the web and you can buy them now brand new made <unk> so in a certain sense <unk> 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 812.22 814.87 <NA> technologies don 't die in fact
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 814.95 818.72 <NA> <unk> you can buy for fifty bucks
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 820.35 824.9 <NA> <unk> a stone age knife made exactly the same way that they were made ten thousand
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 828.7 839.69 <NA> <unk> what 's important is that this information actually never died out it 's not just that it was resurrected it 's continued all along and in papua new guinea they were making stone axes until two decades ago just
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 839.56 845.78 <NA> as a course of of practical matters even when we try to get rid
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 845.5 849.96 <NA> of a technology it 's actually very hard <unk> so we 've all heard about the
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 850.04 856.75 <NA> <unk> amish giving up cars we 've heard about the japanese giving up guns we 've heard about this and that <unk> but i actually went back and took
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 856.54 862.47 <NA> what i could find <unk> the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology <unk> 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 861.98 872.31 <NA> and then i tried to find out when they came back in because they always came back in and it turns out that the time <unk> the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited is decreasing over time <unk>
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 872.26 879.82 <NA> <unk> and that basically you can delay technology <unk> but you can 't kill it <unk> so this makes sense because in a certain sense what culture is 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 880.04 888.64 <NA> is the accumulation of ideas <unk> that 's what it 's for it 's so that ideas don 't die out and when we take that 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 888.84 892.18 <NA> we take this idea of what culture is doing
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 891.84 904.88 <NA> and add it to what the long term trajectory again in life 's evolution we find that each case each of the major transitions in life what they 're really about is accelerating and changing the way
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 904.96 906.62 <NA> <unk> which evolution happens 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 906.42 910.02 <NA> they 're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated <unk> 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 909.84 920.82 <NA> so all these steps in evolution are increasing basically the evolution of evolvability so what 's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas these new hacks 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 920.82 927.65 <NA> are increasing <unk> and the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring <unk> 
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 927.58 929.73 <NA> and then what we see in the singularity
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 929.77 933.99 <NA> that prophesized by kurzweil and others his idea that
KevinKelly_2005 1 KevinKelly_2005 933.89 940.32 <NA> technology is accelerating evolution it 's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas <unk>
