RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 28.21 29.97 <NA> between the federal forces

RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 37.85 43.44 <NA> the citizens didn 't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 43.37 50.02 <NA> and burning trucks used as barricades across the city so truly like a battlefield after
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 50 57.97 <NA> <unk> these two days and during a particularly intense encounter it was presumed that the leader of la familia michoacana nazario moreno was killed 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 57.96 66.14 <NA> in response to this terrifying violence the mayor of apatzingn decided to call the citizens to a march for peace <unk> the idea was
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 65.93 75.05 <NA> to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state and so the day of the scheduled procession thousands of people showed up
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 75.64 83.96 <NA> <unk> as the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march his team noticed that while half of the participants
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 83.65 92.15 <NA> were appropriately dressed in white <unk> and bearing banners asking for peace <unk> the other half was actually marching in support

RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 95.64 104.19 <NA> leader shocked <unk> the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 105.44 112.14 <NA> <unk> and so his team stepped aside the two marches joined together <unk> and they continued their
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 111.92 116.82 <NA> path towards the state capital this story
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 117.26 120.07 <NA> of horrific violence
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 120.07 128.98 <NA> followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 130.08 132.61 <NA> <unk> metaphor for what 's happening in mexico today 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 132.51 141.19 <NA> where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 140.79 147.52 <NA> if you decided to spend thirty minutes trying to figure out what 's going on with drug violence in mexico by say just researching online <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 147.42 150.05 <NA> the first thing you would find out is that while
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 150.04 153.59 <NA> <unk> the laws state that all mexican citizens are equal 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 153.37 158.04 <NA> there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 157.8 166.65 <NA> because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between sixty and one hundred thousand people have lost their lives in drug related violence 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 166.65 171.57 <NA> to put these numbers in perspective this is eight times larger than the number of casualties
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 171.38 175.14 <NA> in the iraq and afghanistan wars combined
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 175.94 185.64 <NA> <unk> it 's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the syrian civil war <unk> which is an active civil war this is happening just south of the border <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 186.05 192.91 <NA> now as you 're reading however you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths <unk> because
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 192.7 199.9 <NA> you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless <unk> nameless dead people implicitly or
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 200.52 208.18 <NA> <unk> there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade <unk> and we infer this
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 207.93 213.85 <NA> because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner or most likely both
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 213.45 217.57 <NA> and so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 217.98 223.9 <NA> and so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved they were part of the bad guys
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 223.98 229.43 <NA> <unk> and that creates some some form of comfort for a lot of people however
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 230.17 238.11 <NA> <unk> while it 's easier to think of us <unk> the citizens the police the army as the good guys <unk> and them
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 240.13 249.84 <NA> <unk> as the bad guys if you think about it the latter are only providing a service to the former whether we like it or not the
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 250.4 252.33 <NA> <unk> is the largest market
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 251.99 260.17 <NA> for illegal substances in the world accounting for more than half of global demand it shares thousands of miles of border with mexico
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 259.96 262.86 <NA> that is its only route of access from the south 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 263.12 271.08 <NA> and so as the former dictator of mexico porfirio diaz used to say poor mexico so far from god
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 270.59 273.36 <NA> and so close to the united states 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 275.85 280.75 <NA> <unk> estimates that there are fifty five million users of illegal drugs in the united states <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 280.32 290.39 <NA> using very very conservative assumptions this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between thirty and one hundred and fifty billion dollars <unk> if we assume
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 290.06 294.25 <NA> that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part which we know is false 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 294.25 300.82 <NA> that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between fifteen billion and sixty billion dollars 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 300.87 304.97 <NA> to put these numbers in perspective microsoft has yearly revenues
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 304.9 306.62 <NA> <unk> of sixty billion dollars
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 307.12 316.31 <NA> <unk> and it so happens that this is a product that because of its nature a business model to address this market requires you
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 315.82 325.13 <NA> to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed <unk> and the only way to do this 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 325.1 333.12 <NA> <unk> because it 's illegal is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs <unk> hence
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 332.72 334.41 <NA> the violence if
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 334.01 343.23 <NA> you look at a map of cartel influence and violence you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 342.89 346.47 <NA> the only thing that the cartels are doing is that they 're trying to protect their business 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 346.85 354.97 <NA> it 's not only a multi billion dollar market but it 's also a complex one for example the coca plant is is a fragile plant that can only
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 354.9 356.56 <NA> <unk> grow in certain latitudes
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 356.33 362.62 <NA> and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized international production 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 362.62 372.01 <NA> that by the way needs to have good quality control because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 371.85 375.17 <NA> and so that means they need to secure production
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 375 381.62 <NA> <unk> and quality control in the south and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 381.61 390.03 <NA> in the markets where these drugs are consumed <unk> i urge you but only a little bit because i don 't want to get you in trouble to just
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 389.58 397.91 <NA> ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want wherever you want it whenever you want it anywhere in the u s 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 397.54 404.37 <NA> and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 404.84 413.19 <NA> <unk> guarantee delivery of the drug in thirty minutes or less think about this for a second think about the complexity
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 412.96 419.26 <NA> of the distribution network that i just described <unk> it 's very difficult to reconcile this
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 419.08 425.31 <NA> with the image of faceless <unk> ignorant goons that are just shooting each other 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 425.57 429.97 <NA> very difficult to reconcile now as a business professor and as any business
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 429.96 433.81 <NA> <unk> professor would tell you an effective organization requires
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 433.35 441.16 <NA> an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure good incentives a solid identity and good brand management 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 441.09 446.38 <NA> this leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30 minute exploration of drug violence in mexico <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 446.38 453.19 <NA> because you would quickly realize <unk> and maybe be confused by the fact that there are three organizations that are constantly named
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 452.73 454.91 <NA> in the articles you will
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 454.84 463.37 <NA> <unk> hear about los zetas <unk> the knights templar which is the new brand for the familia michoacana that i spoke about at the beginning and the sinaloa federation 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 463.36 468.23 <NA> you will read that los zetas is this assortment of sociopaths
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 467.86 475.11 <NA> that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press <unk> and this is somewhat true or mostly
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 476.48 477.78 <NA> <unk> but this is the result
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 477.61 482.22 <NA> of a very careful branding and business strategy 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 481.88 483.67 <NA> you see los zetas
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 483.67 492.99 <NA> is not just this random assortment of individuals but was actually created by another criminal organization the gulf cartel that used to control the eastern corridor of mexico <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 492.62 499.83 <NA> when that corridor became contested they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 499.49 500.97 <NA> so
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 500.66 504.94 <NA> they recruited los zetas an entire unit
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 505.01 507.94 <NA> of elite paratroopers from the mexican army <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 508.86 517 <NA> they were incredibly effective as enforcers for the gulf cartel so much so that at some point they decided to just take over the operations which
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 517.02 520.69 <NA> is why i ask you to never keep tigers as pets 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 520.74 523.45 <NA> because they grow up <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 523.59 529.85 <NA> because the zetas organization was founded in treason they lost some of the linkages to the production
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 529.84 532.76 <NA> <unk> distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 532.48 541.43 <NA> but what they did have <unk> and this is again based on their military origin was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 541.63 544.61 <NA> and a very clear promotion path
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 544.61 553.89 <NA> that allowed them to supervise and operate across many many markets very effectively <unk> which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 555.35 563.07 <NA> <unk> and so because they didn 't have access to the more profitable drug markets this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 563.66 569.56 <NA> that includes kidnapping <unk> prostitution local drug dealing
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 569.38 576.27 <NA> and human trafficking including of migrants that go from the south to the u s so what they currently run
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 575.9 577.86 <NA> is truly
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 578 579.61 <NA> and quite literally
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 579.93 581.71 <NA> <unk> a franchise business <unk>

RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 595.65 600.05 <NA> the way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality <unk> they
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 600 606.68 <NA> <unk> let people know that they are there and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say i offer you
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 606.37 613.44 <NA> to be the local representative of the zeta brand if they agree and you don 't want to know what happens if they don 't
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 613.2 621.62 <NA> they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town in exchange for royalties 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 621.7 628.28 <NA> this kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear <unk> and so los zetas
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 628.42 629.94 <NA> carefully stage
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 630.22 632.92 <NA> acts of violence that are spectacular in nature
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 632.68 638.94 <NA> especially when they arrive first in a city <unk> but again that 's just a brand strategy 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 638.84 646.14 <NA> i 'm not saying they 're not violent <unk> but what i am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all when you count when
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 646.19 649.6 <NA> you do the body count they 're actually all the same
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 651.69 660.73 <NA> <unk> in contrast to them the knights templar that arose in michoacn emerged in reaction to the incursion of the zetas into the state of <unk>

RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 671.79 679.91 <NA> the knights templar realized very quickly that they couldn 't face the zetas on violence alone <unk> and so they developed a strategy as a

RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 857.51 867.78 <NA> like any multinational would <unk> they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business which is high margin drugs like cocaine <unk> heroine <unk> methamphetamines 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 867.65 875.02 <NA> like any traditional latin american multinational would the way they control their operations is through family ties <unk> when they
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 875.04 884.8 <NA> <unk> entering a new market they send <unk> a family member to supervise it or if they 're partnering with a new organization they create a family tie <unk> either through marriages or other types
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 884.67 890.57 <NA> of ties <unk> like any other multinational would they protect their brand
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 890.33 898.9 <NA> by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model like for example when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 898.56 904.79 <NA> they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them and they try to
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 904.75 910.73 <NA> <unk> separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this to further
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 910.73 915.06 <NA> strengthen their brand they actually have professional p r firms
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 914.64 923.16 <NA> that shape how the press talks about them <unk> they have professional videographers on staff <unk> they have incredibly productive ties
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 923.16 926.39 <NA> with the security organizations on both sides
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 925.96 927.59 <NA> of the border <unk> 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 928.72 929.88 <NA> and so
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 929.99 933.36 <NA> <unk> differences aside what these three organizations share
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 934.07 937.84 <NA> is on the one hand a very clear understanding
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 937.84 944.04 <NA> that institutions cannot be imposed from the top <unk> but rather they are built from the bottom up
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 943.76 953.89 <NA> one interaction at a time <unk> they have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 956.25 962.05 <NA> and so what i want you to remember from this talk are three things <unk> the first one
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 961.56 965.77 <NA> is that drug violence is actually the result
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 965.31 968.41 <NA> of a huge market demand
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 968.46 977.2 <NA> and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 977.28 979.88 <NA> delivery routes the
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 979.81 986.3 <NA> <unk> second thing i want you to remember is that these are sophisticated coherent organizations
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 986.17 995.96 <NA> that are business organizations <unk> and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach the third thing i want you to remember
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 995.5 1004.34 <NA> is that even though we 're more comfortable with this idea of them a set of bad guys separated from us we are actually accomplices to them
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1005.56 1007.7 <NA> <unk> either through our direct consumption
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1007.48 1016.13 <NA> or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1015.85 1019.76 <NA> of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption 
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1021.13 1024.93 <NA> these organizations service recruit
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1025.82 1031.44 <NA> <unk> operate within our communities so necessarily they are much more integrated within them
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1031.04 1035.82 <NA> than we are comfortable acknowledging <unk> and so
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1035.82 1043.44 <NA> to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have we see that the nature of this phenomenon
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1043.19 1048.97 <NA> guarantees that they will the question is whether we are willing to continue
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1048.97 1052.02 <NA> our support of a failed strategy
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1053.06 1054.97 <NA> based on our stubborn
RodrigoCanales_2013S 1 RodrigoCanales_2013S 1055.41 1064.52 <NA> blissful voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young <unk> thank you
