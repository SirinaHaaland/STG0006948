SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 194.03 196.72 <NA> and this is where the story started to bother me 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 196.72 204.97 <NA> in biology we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but

SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 220.41 228.91 <NA> maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons of any brain regardless of its size especially in the cerebral cortex <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 228.54 229.97 <NA> so this to me became
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 230.02 236.81 <NA> <unk> the important question to answer how many neurons does the human brain have and how does that compare to other animals 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 236.35 246.56 <NA> now you may have heard or read somewhere that we have one hundred billion neurons <unk> so ten years ago i asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from but nobody did

SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 258.71 266.88 <NA> so i came up with my own way to count cells in the brain <unk> and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 267.08 279.91 <NA> it works like this you take a brain <unk> or parts of that brain and you dissolve it in detergent which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact so you end up with

SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 318.01 320.55 <NA> take rodents and primates for instance 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 320.55 329.97 <NA> in larger rodent brains the average size of the neuron increases so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 330.1 340.5 <NA> but primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain the result is that a primate brain will always have <unk>

SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 351.75 360.34 <NA> <unk> sixteen billion of which are in the cerebral cortex and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 360 368.59 <NA> awareness and logical and abstract reasoning <unk> and that sixteen billion is the most neurons that any cortex has 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 368.59 373.7 <NA> i think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 373.49 374.99 <NA> but just as important is what
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 375.58 383.72 <NA> <unk> billion neurons mean because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically we could calculate
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 383.55 392.3 <NA> what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain so a rodent brain with eighty six billion neurons would weigh

SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 394.54 401.04 <NA> that 's not possible a brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight <unk> and this impossible brain would go in the body of
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 405.05 414.75 <NA> <unk> like us <unk> so this brings us to a very important conclusion already which is that we are not rodents the human brain is not a large rat brain <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 414.38 422.89 <NA> compared to a rat we might seem special yes but that 's not a fair comparison to make given that we know that we are not rodents we are primates <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 422.89 425.05 <NA> so the correct comparison is to other
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 425.82 436.53 <NA> <unk> and there if you do the math <unk> you find that a generic primate with eighty six billion neurons would have a brain of about one point two kilos which seems just right <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 436.54 449.72 <NA> in a body of some sixty six kilos which in my case is exactly right <unk> which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion i am a primate and all of you are

SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 452.38 461.12 <NA> i love to think that darwin would have really appreciated this his brain <unk> like ours was made in the image of other primate brains <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 460.63 473.99 <NA> so the human brain may be remarkable yes <unk> but it is not special in its number of neurons it is just a large primate brain i think that 's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 474.04 475.08 <NA> why does
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 477.05 487.17 <NA> <unk> other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of we could do the math <unk> and it turns out that both human <unk>
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 487.12 497.49 <NA> and other brains cost about the same an average of six calories per billion neurons per day <unk> so the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple linear function <unk>

SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 505.23 516.38 <NA> <unk> so the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 516.38 520.12 <NA> the relative cost of our brain is large <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 519.66 522.85 <NA> but just because we 're primates not because we 're special 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 522.54 529.94 <NA> last question then how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons and in particular if great apes are larger than
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 529.93 534.5 <NA> <unk> we are why don 't they have a larger brain than we do with more neurons <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 534.3 538.88 <NA> when we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain i figured 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 538.88 546.86 <NA> maybe there 's a simple reason they just can 't afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons <unk> so we did the math <unk> 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 546.52 554.79 <NA> we calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods and on the other hand how much energy a body of a

SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 566.9 578.32 <NA> what we found is that because neurons are so expensive there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons so a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 579.93 583.34 <NA> <unk> then its body cannot be any bigger than twenty five kilos 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 583.34 594.58 <NA> to weigh any more than that it has to give up neurons so it 's either a large body or a large number of neurons when you eat like a primate you can 't afford both 
SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 1 SuzanaHerculanoHouzel_2013G 594.12 597.68 <NA> one way out of this metabolic limitation would be to
