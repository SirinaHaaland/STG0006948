ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 564.86 573.03 <NA> and how much will they pay for this we fixed the pricing taking into account what they would save in bus fare
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 572.54 577.63 <NA> in coming to a city so they pay about twenty rupees <unk> and that 's good for three consultations
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 581.73 586.87 <NA> <unk> the other challenge was how do you give high tech or more advanced treatment and care we
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 586.53 595.12 <NA> designed a van with a vsat which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is

ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 611.11 615.38 <NA> as a way of bridging the the technology competence <unk> 
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 616.57 622.76 <NA> so the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market <unk> because it focused on the <unk>
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 623.91 628.5 <NA> and then by reaching the unreached we 're able to significantly grow the market
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 629.87 637.38 <NA> <unk> the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists <unk> so what is in this video
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 637.31 645.18 <NA> is a surgeon operating and then you see on the other side another patient is getting ready so as they finish
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 645.11 654.79 <NA> the surgery <unk> they just swing the microscope over the tables are placed so that their distance is just right <unk> and then we need to do this because
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 654.87 657.06 <NA> <unk> doing this kind of process we 're able to
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 656.84 660.79 <NA> more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon <unk> 
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 661.2 668.27 <NA> and then to support the surgeon we require a certain workforce <unk> and then we focused on
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 668.04 675.02 <NA> village girls that we recruited <unk> and then they really are the backbone of the organization they do almost all of
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 677.14 685.88 <NA> <unk> they do one thing at a time they do it extremely well <unk> with the result we have very high productivity very high quality at very very low cost 
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 687.55 693.65 <NA> so putting all this together what really happened was the productivity of our staff
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 693.19 695.73 <NA> was significantly higher than
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 695.73 696.83 <NA> anyone else 
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 702.97 704.79 <NA> this is a very busy table
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 704.87 709.54 <NA> <unk> but what this really is conveying is that when it comes to quality we have put in very
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 709.33 716.84 <NA> good quality assurance systems as a result our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the

ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 729.87 734.59 <NA> <unk> for it <unk> so what we did was <unk> we gave away a lot of it for free <unk>

ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 745.67 750.13 <NA> and of course one needs the mindset to be wanting to
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 1 ThulasirajRavilla_2009I 749.67 754.79 <NA> give away what you have as a surplus the result has been over the years
