LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 13.45 19.17 <NA> <unk> when we think of nepal <unk> we tend to think of the snow capped mountains of the himalayas
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 19.17 25.59 <NA> the crystal clear still waters of its alpine lakes or the huge expanse of its grasslands 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 25.37 29.76 <NA> what some of us may not realize is that in the himalayan foothills
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 30.05 43.02 <NA> <unk> where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener <unk> there lives a great diversity of wildlife <unk> including the one horned rhinoceros the asian elephant and the bengal tiger <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 42.77 49.96 <NA> but unfortunately these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 51.12 59.05 <NA> <unk> to stop the killing of these animals battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect nepal 's national parks <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 59.05 61.58 <NA> but that is not an easy task because
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 61.25 67.93 <NA> these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 67.76 72.85 <NA> it is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 72.85 79.43 <NA> and therefore nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 81.17 90.54 <NA> nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime <unk> and these are drones or more specifically conservation drones 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 90.32 99.63 <NA> for about a year now my colleagues and i have been building drones for nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 99.39 104.97 <NA> not only does a drone give you a bird <unk> 's eye view of the landscape <unk> but it also allows you
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 104.96 106.9 <NA> <unk> to capture detailed
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 108.01 110.58 <NA> images of objects on the ground this
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 110.24 119.17 <NA> for example is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of nepal 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 119.17 124.84 <NA> now we believe that drones have tremendous potential not only for combating
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 126.87 132.25 <NA> <unk> for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations <unk> so what is a drone
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 131.82 139.25 <NA> well the kind of drone i 'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 139.04 143.56 <NA> and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 143.56 150.01 <NA> a gps a compass a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 149.58 154.82 <NA> now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload such as a video
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 154.78 164.64 <NA> <unk> camera or a photographic camera it also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission to tell the drone where to go 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 164.64 172.43 <NA> now people i talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 171.94 175.08 <NA> but they are even more surprised when i tell them how
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 175 177.42 <NA> <unk> affordable these components are 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 176.93 178.41 <NA> the facts is 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 178.41 186.66 <NA> a conservation drone doesn 't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 186.8 194.55 <NA> so now that you 've built your own conservation drone you probably want to go fly it but how does one fly a drone well
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 194.33 198.51 <NA> actually you don 't <unk> because the drone flies itself <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 198.02 204.94 <NA> all you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly but you simply do that
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 204.9 211.72 <NA> <unk> by clicking on a few way points on the google maps interface using the open source software 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 211.38 221.23 <NA> those missions could be as simple as just a few way points or they could be slightly longer and more complicated to fly along a river system <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 220.8 225.02 <NA> sometimes <unk> we fly the drone in a lawnmower type pattern
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 225.22 231.89 <NA> <unk> and take pictures of that area <unk> and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 231.61 241.79 <NA> other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 241.62 243.52 <NA> now whatever your mission is 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 243.52 254.97 <NA> once you 've programmed it you simply upload it to the autopilot system bring your drone to the field <unk> and launch it simply by tossing it in the air and often we 'll go about this mission
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 255.22 256.53 <NA> taking pictures
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 256.36 260.2 <NA> or videos along the way <unk> and usually at that point <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 260.02 271.03 <NA> we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee sit back and relax for the next few minutes <unk> although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 271.03 275.94 <NA> usually it does <unk> and when it does it even lands automatically <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 276.32 279.34 <NA> so what can we do with a conservation drone
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 279.87 289.48 <NA> <unk> well when we built our first prototype drone our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in north sumatra indonesia 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 289.48 294.82 <NA> to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 294.36 299.9 <NA> the reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 302.95 314.13 <NA> <unk> now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 314.13 320.06 <NA> where you might find an orangutan or its nest <unk> now as you can imagine that is a very <unk>
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 322.32 329.94 <NA> and costly process so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 329.87 336.13 <NA> <unk> populations in indonesia and elsewhere in southeast asia <unk> so we were very excited when we
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 335.95 345.75 <NA> captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera <unk> and this is it this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 345.47 350.02 <NA> since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 350.01 352.27 <NA> <unk> around various parts of southeast asia <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 352.27 363.37 <NA> and we 're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we 've collected so far <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 363.15 369.8 <NA> but nests are not the only objects these drones can detect <unk> this is a wild orangutan
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 369.62 374.99 <NA> happily feeding on top of a palm tree <unk> seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 375.82 378.29 <NA> <unk> not once but several times 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 377.83 387.32 <NA> we 've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in gabon <unk> elephants <unk> and even turtle nests 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 386.98 399.17 <NA> but besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves <unk> we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 399.07 400.29 <NA> sometimes
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 400.79 405.3 <NA> <unk> zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 405.07 415.38 <NA> this is an oil palm plantation in sumatra <unk> now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world <unk> so we wanted to use this <unk>
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 415.28 421.77 <NA> <unk> new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in southeast asia <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 427.38 435.25 <NA> <unk> a recently logged forest again in sumatra you could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 436.44 448.16 <NA> but perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 448.16 450.23 <NA> and this map gives us crucial
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 450 462.56 <NA> crucial information for monitoring land use change to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding where forests might be contracting or where fires might be breaking out 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 462.34 466.11 <NA> aerial images could also be processed to produce
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 467.31 479.22 <NA> computer models of forests now these models are not just visually appealing <unk> but they are also geometrically accurate which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 480.17 489.06 <NA> <unk> surface area the volume of vegetation <unk> and so on <unk> all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 488.99 503.08 <NA> recently <unk> we 've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras <unk> now these cameras can detect <unk> heat emitting objects from the ground <unk> and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 505.32 518.26 <NA> <unk> so i 've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are how you might operate one of these drones <unk> and what a drone could do for you i will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 517.92 525.65 <NA> we built our first prototype drones in switzerland <unk> we brought a few of these to indonesia for the first few test flights <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 525.65 529.94 <NA> since then we 've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 529.98 536.27 <NA> and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 535.9 544.73 <NA> perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 545.02 554.73 <NA> building drones for us is a constant work in progress we are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range their ruggedness
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 554.9 557.4 <NA> <unk> and the amount of payload they can carry <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 557.2 571.47 <NA> we also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones for example camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 573.26 574.99 <NA> <unk> motion activated cameras so they snap a
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 575 578.11 <NA> picture every time an animal crosses their path <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 577.91 588.19 <NA> but the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images and that takes a lot <unk>
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 588.09 593.62 <NA> <unk> of time <unk> especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 610.03 625.04 <NA> <unk> radio collars are another tool that 's commonly used by biologists <unk> now these collars are put onto animals they transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 624.58 628.7 <NA> but the traditional way of tracking animals is
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 628.63 629.97 <NA> pretty ridiculous
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 630.02 636.82 <NA> <unk> because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 636.82 642.81 <NA> not unlike those old tv antennae we used to have on our rooftops some of us still do 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 642.44 649.81 <NA> a drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently <unk> why not equip a drone with a scanning radio
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 650.52 665.05 <NA> <unk> fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 664.77 669.44 <NA> a third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 669.25 672.35 <NA> is to fly them to a really remote
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 673.79 679.97 <NA> rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics and parachute down a tiny spy microphone
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 680.04 690.18 <NA> that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals <unk> birds <unk> amphibians the yeti the sasquatch <unk> bigfoot <unk> whatever 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 690.18 696.59 <NA> that would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 696.1 704.97 <NA> and finally i would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone the maja drone has a wingspan of about two meters
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 705.28 712.47 <NA> it weighs only about two kilograms <unk> but it can carry half its weight it is a fully autonomous system <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 712.04 718.68 <NA> during its mission it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 718.67 723.33 <NA> which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 722.9 724.81 <NA> it carries a variety of
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 725.79 732.25 <NA> <unk> and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 731.85 743.68 <NA> this drone can stay in the air for forty to sixty minutes which gives it a range of up to fifty kilometers that is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 743.7 749.93 <NA> now conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 751.57 755.03 <NA> <unk> we believe strongly believe that drones
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 754.86 760.04 <NA> can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications <unk> 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 759.73 766.56 <NA> we 've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 766.56 772.94 <NA> and in a way they are right <unk> i mean let 's be honest drones are the ultimate toys for boys but
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 772.96 779.85 <NA> at the same time <unk> we 've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 779.96 782.43 <NA> <unk> see the potential of conservation drones 
LianPinKoh_2013G 1 LianPinKoh_2013G 782.43 796.21 <NA> to us it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool including drones in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet
