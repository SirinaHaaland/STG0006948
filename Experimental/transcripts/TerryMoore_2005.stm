TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 25 32.85 <NA> i also have reason to believe that many if not most of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly now
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 32.57 40.59 <NA> i know that seems ludicrous <unk> i know that seems ludicrous <unk> and believe me <unk> i lived the same sad life until about three years ago <unk> 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 40.4 49.95 <NA> and what happened to me was i bought <unk> what was for me a very expensive pair of shoes but those shoes came with round nylon laces and i couldn 't keep them tied 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 49.95 54.22 <NA> so i went back to the store and said to the owner i love the shoes but i hate the laces
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 54.96 57.82 <NA> <unk> a look and said oh you 're tying them wrong 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 57.6 62.17 <NA> now up until that moment <unk> i would have thought that by age fifty

TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 70.89 73.78 <NA> <unk> this is the way
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 73.5 76.55 <NA> that most of us were taught to tie our shoes
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 79.93 81.77 <NA> <unk> as it turns out thank you

TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 86.56 92.93 <NA> there 's a strong form and a weak form of this knot and we were taught the weak form and here 's how to tell <unk> 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 92.92 100.05 <NA> if you pull the strands at the base of the knot <unk> you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 100.43 106.2 <NA> <unk> that 's the weak form of the knot <unk> but not to worry <unk> if we start over
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 106.22 107.4 <NA> and
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 107.23 110.91 <NA> simply go the other direction around the bow 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 110.42 117.52 <NA> we get this the strong form of the knot <unk> and if you pull the cords under the knot you will see that
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 117.04 121.41 <NA> the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe <unk> 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 120.92 129.21 <NA> this is a stronger knot it will come untied less often it will let you down less and not only that it looks better we
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 129.87 131.53 <NA> <unk> do this one more time 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 134.25 136.3 <NA> start as usual 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 138 143.5 <NA> go the other way around the loop this is a little hard for children but i think you can handle it 
TerryMoore_2005 1 TerryMoore_2005 145.56 151.99 <NA> pull the knot there it is the strong form of the shoe knot now
