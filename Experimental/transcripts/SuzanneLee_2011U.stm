SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 12.91 19.79 <NA> <unk> so as a fashion designer i 've always tended to think of materials something like this or this 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 21.13 23.18 <NA> or maybe this 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 24.52 29.79 <NA> but then i met a biologist <unk> and now i think of materials like this
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 29.9 34.98 <NA> green tea sugar a few microbes and a little time <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 34.79 37.81 <NA> i 'm essentially using a kombucha recipe <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 37.81 44.89 <NA> which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria <unk> yeasts and other micro organisms which spin cellulose
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 44.72 53.41 <NA> in a fermentation process over time <unk> these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 56.13 64.6 <NA> <unk> so we start by brewing the tea i brew up to about thirty liters of tea at a time <unk> and then while it 's still hot add a couple of kilos of sugar 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 64.14 69.44 <NA> we stir this in until it 's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 69.44 74.93 <NA> we need to check that the temperature has cooled to below thirty degrees c and then we 're ready to add the
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 76.18 84.32 <NA> <unk> and along with that some acetic acid <unk> and once you get this process going you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 84.43 88.52 <NA> we need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 88.15 93.48 <NA> and i use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 93.48 99.59 <NA> and actually in hot weather i can just grow it outside so this is my mini fabric farm 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 99.34 104.97 <NA> after about three days the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid so this is telling us that the fermentation is in
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 104.99 106.38 <NA> <unk> full swing <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 105.89 116.64 <NA> and the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid <unk> so they 're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose and they 're sticking together <unk> forming layers <unk>
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 116.59 123.87 <NA> and giving us a sheet on the surface after about two to three weeks we 're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 125 128.45 <NA> <unk> left is after five days <unk> and on the right after ten 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 128.21 130.6 <NA> and this is a static culture you don 't
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 130.6 139.28 <NA> have to do anything to it you just literally watch it grow it doesn 't need light and when it 's ready to harvest you take it out of the bath
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 138.89 141.7 <NA> and you wash it in cold soapy water 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 141.54 149.84 <NA> at this point it 's really heavy <unk> it 's over ninety percent water so we need to let that evaporate so i spread it out onto a wooden sheet <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 150.22 153.14 <NA> <unk> you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 152.92 161.55 <NA> and as it 's drying it 's compressing <unk> so what you 're left with depending on the recipe is something that 's either like a really light weight transparent paper 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 161.55 165.38 <NA> or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 165.1 174.93 <NA> and then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally or you can use the wet material to form it around a three dimensional shape <unk> and as it
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 175.67 178.77 <NA> <unk> it will knit itself together forming seams 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 178.52 185.67 <NA> so the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea <unk> i guess it also looks a little bit like human skin which intrigues me 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 186.02 187.86 <NA> since it 's organic 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 187.86 199.66 <NA> i 'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals i can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation using fruit and vegetable staining <unk> create organic
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 204.72 212.38 <NA> <unk> and in fact cotton would take up to eighteen dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark <unk> and because of the <unk>
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 213.48 217.75 <NA> <unk> of this kind of cellulose it just takes one and a really short one at that 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 217.5 225.67 <NA> what i can 't yet do is make it <unk> water resistant so if i was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 225.27 228.53 <NA> i would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 230.38 236.66 <NA> <unk> the dress would get really heavy <unk> and eventually the seams would probably fall apart leaving me feeling rather naked <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 236.65 241.46 <NA> possibly a good performance piece but definitely not ideal for everyday wear 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 242.11 244.35 <NA> what i 'm looking for
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 244.17 245.39 <NA> is
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 244.9 250.08 <NA> a way to give the material the qualities that i need <unk> so what i want to do is say
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 250 253.38 <NA> <unk> to a future bug spin me a thread <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 252.95 261.48 <NA> align it in this direction make it hydrophobic <unk> and while you 're at it just form it around this 3d shape 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 262.1 269.31 <NA> bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing <unk> and possibly in the future for
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 268.85 275.14 <NA> biocompatible blood vessels possibly even replacement bone tissue <unk> but with synthetic
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 275.7 279.38 <NA> <unk> we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 279.14 287.35 <NA> to produce something that gives us the quality quantity and shape of material that we desire <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 287.01 296.65 <NA> obviously as a designer that 's really exciting because then i start to think wow <unk> we could actually imagine growing consumable products 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 298.5 304.94 <NA> what excites me about using microbes is their efficiency <unk> so we only grow
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 304.9 307.58 <NA> <unk> what we need there 's no waste 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 307.39 315.98 <NA> and in fact we could make it from a waste stream so for example a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 316 321.62 <NA> finally at the end of use we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 322.3 329.79 <NA> what i 'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton leather or other textile materials
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 329.8 331.08 <NA> but
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 330.91 337.56 <NA> i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources <unk> 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 337.07 345.66 <NA> ultimately maybe it won 't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact we could for example imagine growing a lamp 
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 345.26 348.19 <NA> a chair a car
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 347.95 349.99 <NA> or maybe even a house <unk> so i
SuzanneLee_2011U 1 SuzanneLee_2011U 375.22 380.52 <NA> <unk> part of the project 's still in process because this one is is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes
