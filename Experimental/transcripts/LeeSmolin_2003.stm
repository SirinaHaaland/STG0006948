LeeSmolin_2003 1 LeeSmolin_2003 402.83 413.16 <NA> <unk> so we call it a relational universe all properties of things are about these kinds of relationships <unk> and also <unk> if youre embedded in such a network of relationships <unk> your view <unk>
LeeSmolin_2003 1 LeeSmolin_2003 413.06 424.99 <NA> <unk> of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations and theres no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making

LeeSmolin_2003 1 LeeSmolin_2003 435.06 444.98 <NA> theyre thinking about the same things and not only that they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often <unk> so theres an interesting discussion
LeeSmolin_2003 1 LeeSmolin_2003 444.81 449.93 <NA> going on there this last view of cosmology is called the relational

LeeSmolin_2003 1 LeeSmolin_2003 522.18 525.56 <NA> <unk> then it turns out that natural selection
LeeSmolin_2003 1 LeeSmolin_2003 525.33 529.97 <NA> would only make sense in such a relational universe that is natural selection
LeeSmolin_2003 1 LeeSmolin_2003 530.07 539.19 <NA> works on properties like fitness <unk> which are about relationships of some species to some other species <unk>
