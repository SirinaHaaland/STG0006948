RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 189.86 197.52 <NA> i 've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 197.06 204.97 <NA> and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not he did it it was very simple in a way he took all the drugs that were
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 204.93 211.78 <NA> <unk> known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that don 't change glucose and said what 's the difference in their side effects

RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 241.57 245.36 <NA> he said i know russ i thought you might say that nick is smart 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 245.65 254.34 <NA> i thought you might say that so i did one other experiment i looked at people in this database who were on two drugs and i looked for signals similar

RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 285.24 298.75 <NA> there are millions of americans on those two drugs in fact we learned later fifteen million americans on paroxetine at the time <unk> fifteen million on pravastatin <unk> and a million we estimated on both so that
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 298.29 304.79 <NA> 's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the

RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 306.85 316.94 <NA> but i said it 's still not publishable because i love what you did with the mumbo jumbo with the machine learning but it 's not really <unk> standard of proof evidence that we have 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 317.29 325.17 <NA> so we have to do something else let 's go into the stanford electronic medical record we have a copy of it that 's ok for research we removed identifying
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 326.87 331.02 <NA> <unk> let 's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 330.77 336.6 <NA> now there are thousands and thousands of people in the stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 336.29 341.26 <NA> <unk> but we needed special patients we needed patients who were on one of them
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 341.04 350.14 <NA> and had a glucose measurement <unk> then got the second one and had another glucose measurement all within a reasonable period of time something like two months

RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 375.52 381.02 <NA> <unk> your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes so a twenty bump
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 380.71 384.98 <NA> pretty significant i said nick this is very cool <unk> 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 385.15 391.07 <NA> but i 'm sorry we still don 't have a paper because this is ten patients and give me a break it 's not enough patients 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 391 404.97 <NA> so we said what can we do and we said let 's call our friends at harvard and vanderbilt who also harvard in boston vanderbilt in nashville who also have electronic medical records similar to ours let 's see if they can find similar patients with the one p <unk> the other p
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 405.04 408.45 <NA> the glucose measurements in that range that we need 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 408.26 415.11 <NA> god bless them vanderbilt in one week found forty such patients <unk> same trend <unk> 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 415.25 429.52 <NA> harvard found one hundred patients <unk> same trend <unk> so at the end we had one hundred and fifty patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 430.26 441.58 <NA> <unk> more interestingly we had left out diabetics because diabetics already have messed up glucose when we looked at the glucose of diabetics it was going up sixty milligrams per deciliter not just twenty 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 441.27 449.99 <NA> this was a big deal <unk> and we said we 've got to publish this we submitted the paper <unk> it was all data evidence data from the fda 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 450 455.72 <NA> data from stanford data from vanderbilt data from harvard we had not done a single real experiment <unk> 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 456.01 458 <NA> but we were nervous 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 457.69 465.74 <NA> so nick <unk> while the paper was in review went to the lab we found somebody who knew about lab stuff i don 't do that 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 465.37 468.56 <NA> i take care of patients but i don 't do pipettes
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 468.46 472.85 <NA> <unk> they taught us how to feed mice drugs <unk> 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 472.36 479.34 <NA> we took mice and we gave them one p paroxetine we gave some other mice pravastatin <unk> and we gave a third group of mice

RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 481.46 486.79 <NA> and lo and behold glucose went up twenty to sixty milligrams per deciliter in the mice 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 486.79 493.77 <NA> so the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone <unk> but we added a little note at the end saying oh by the way if you give these to mice it
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 493.43 499.41 <NA> goes up that was great <unk> and the story could have ended there <unk> but i still have six and a half minutes 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 501.86 504.97 <NA> so we were sitting around thinking about all of this
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 505.14 511.04 <NA> and i don 't remember who thought of it but somebody said i wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 510.83 518.77 <NA> are noticing side effects of hyperglycemia <unk> they could and they should how would we ever determine that 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 519.06 524.99 <NA> we said well <unk> what do you do you 're taking a medication one new medication or two and you get a funny feeling
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 525.13 534.14 <NA> <unk> what do you do you go to google and type in the two drugs you 're taking or the one drug you 're taking and you type in side effects what are you experiencing <unk> 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 533.77 542.78 <NA> so we said ok <unk> let 's ask google if they will share their search logs with us so that we can look at the search logs and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 542.32 546.74 <NA> google i am sorry to say denied our request <unk> 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 546.31 554.25 <NA> so i was bummed <unk> i was at a at a dinner with a colleague who works at microsoft research and i said we wanted to do this study google said no it 's kind of a bummer
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 554.87 556.74 <NA> <unk> have the bing searches 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 562.31 563.91 <NA> yeah

RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 592.27 600.17 <NA> so we did a study where we defined fifty words that a regular person might type in if they 're having hyperglycemia
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 604.36 610.79 <NA> <unk> peeing a lot forgive me but that 's one of the things you might type in so we had fifty phrases that we called the diabetes words 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 610.33 620.27 <NA> and we did first a baseline and it turns out that about <unk> 5 to one percent of all searches on the internet involve one of those words so that 's our baseline rate 
RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 619.84 627.98 <NA> if people type in paroxetine or paxil those are synonyms and one of those words <unk> the rate goes up to about two percent

RussAltman_2015P 1 RussAltman_2015P 655.73 666.07 <NA> we published this and it got some attention the reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches <unk>
