MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 14.95 19.13 <NA> <unk> and what i want to do today is share my passion for poo with you
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 20.4 29.25 <NA> which might be quite difficult <unk> but i think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 29.96 34.42 <NA> <unk> this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 34.42 45.6 <NA> and yet it can do things that you and i couldn 't possibly entertain the idea of doing <unk> and basically it 's all evolved to handle its food source <unk> which is dung <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 45.47 51.49 <NA> so the question is where do we start this story <unk> and it seems appropriate to start at the end
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 51.26 54.73 <NA> because this is a waste product that comes out of other
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 54.72 64.99 <NA> <unk> animals <unk> but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living <unk> and so dung beetles eat dung <unk> and <unk>
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 64.89 70.9 <NA> <unk> their larvae are also dung feeders they are grown completely in a ball of dung <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 75.25 82.81 <NA> <unk> in africa we 've got two thousand species of dung beetles <unk> and in the world we have about six thousand species of dung beetles 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 82.81 87.17 <NA> so according to dung beetles dung is pretty good
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 87.9 98.09 <NA> unless you 're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself you 'll never see ninety percent of the dung beetle species because they go directly into the dung 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 97.75 104.58 <NA> straight down below it <unk> and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 105.32 106.65 <NA> so
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 106.58 115.05 <NA> the question is how do they deal with this material <unk> and most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 115.05 117.1 <NA> ten percent of the species
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 116.86 124.96 <NA> actually make a ball and this ball they roll away from the dung source <unk> usually bury it at a remote place
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 127.8 137.14 <NA> <unk> they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls <unk> so this is a very proud owner
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 136.83 144.91 <NA> of a beautiful dung ball you can see it 's a male because he 's got a little hair on the back of his legs there <unk> and he 's clearly very pleased about
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 144.57 149.66 <NA> what he 's sitting on there <unk> and then he 's about to become a victim of a vicious
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 154.75 156.68 <NA> <unk> clear indication
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 156.37 159.47 <NA> that this is a valuable resource <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 159.1 169.25 <NA> and so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way <unk> and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because <unk>
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 169.15 174.24 <NA> <unk> of this because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 180.02 184.62 <NA> <unk> and we think it 's the intense competition that makes the beetles
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 184.7 189.12 <NA> so well adapted to rolling balls of dung <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 188.84 194.46 <NA> so what you 've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the african veld 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 194.42 203.53 <NA> its head is down <unk> it 's walking backwards <unk> it 's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 203.53 204.85 <NA> and at the same
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 205.08 214.49 <NA> <unk> it 's got to deal with the heat this is africa <unk> it 's hot <unk> so what i want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 214.49 215.68 <NA> to
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 215.31 218.18 <NA> investigate how dung beetles
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 218 226.27 <NA> deal with these problems <unk> so watch this beetle and there 's two things that i would like you to be aware of 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 226.56 229.91 <NA> the first is how it deals with this obstacle that we
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 230.05 237.77 <NA> <unk> in its way see look it does a little dance <unk> and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place a
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 238.54 242.69 <NA> little dance <unk> and then heads off in a particular direction <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 242.5 249.96 <NA> so clearly this animal knows where it 's going and it knows where it wants to go <unk> and that 's a very very important thing because
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 250.91 259.71 <NA> <unk> the dung pile you 've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 259.64 263.91 <NA> so we gave them some more tasks to deal with <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 263.9 265.95 <NA> and what we did here
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 265.76 269.28 <NA> is we turned the world under their feet 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 268.94 271.29 <NA> and watch its response
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 277.53 287.62 <NA> <unk> so this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet it 's turned by ninety degrees <unk> but it doesn 't flinch it knows exactly where it wants to go and it heads off in that particular direction <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 287.88 292.63 <NA> so our next question then was how are they doing this 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 292.2 299.45 <NA> what are they doing and there was a cue that that was available to us it was that every now and then they 'd climb on top of the ball
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 300 308.74 <NA> <unk> look at the world around them and what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball what are the obvious cues that this animal could use
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 308.75 313.73 <NA> to direct its movement <unk> and the most obvious one
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 313.24 321.92 <NA> is to look at the sky and so we thought now what could they be looking at in the sky <unk> and the obvious thing to look at
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 321.7 328.41 <NA> is the sun <unk> so a classic experiment here <unk> in that what we did was we moved
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 329.99 338.37 <NA> <unk> we 're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position <unk> and look at what the beetle does it
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 338.21 340.8 <NA> does a little double dance <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 341.15 344.68 <NA> and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 344.35 347.16 <NA> in the first place what happens
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 347.24 354.76 <NA> now so clearly they 're looking at the sun the sun is a very important cue in the sky for them the thing is the sun is not always
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 354.69 359.77 <NA> <unk> available to you <unk> because at sunset it disappears below the horizon
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 359.52 366.44 <NA> what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 366.44 374.96 <NA> that you and i can 't see it 's the way our eyes are built <unk> but the sun is at the horizon over here and we know
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 380.02 386.99 <NA> <unk> a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can 't see that the beetles can see <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 387.46 394.34 <NA> so how do we test that well that 's easy what we do is we get a great big polarization filter 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 394.15 399.84 <NA> pop the beetle underneath it and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 401.18 404.25 <NA> <unk> beetle comes out from underneath the filter
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 405.29 412.86 <NA> and it does a right hand turn because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 412.37 417.09 <NA> and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 418.7 423.3 <NA> so obviously beetles can see polarized light 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 424.28 429.97 <NA> okay <unk> so what we 've got so far is what are beetles doing they 're rolling balls
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 430.1 440.26 <NA> how are they doing it well they 're rolling them in a straight line <unk> how are they maintaining it in a particular straight line well they 're looking at celestial cues in the sky some of which <unk>
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 440.16 449.99 <NA> <unk> you and i can 't see <unk> but how do they pick up those celestial cues that was what was of interest to us next and it was this particular little behavior the dance 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 450 459.47 <NA> we thought was important because look it takes a pause every now and then and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in so
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 459.31 469.15 <NA> what are they doing when they do this dance <unk> how far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves <unk> and in this experiment here <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 469.15 472.46 <NA> what we did was we forced them into a channel <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 472 475.11 <NA> and you can see he wasn 't particularly forced into this particular
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 476.03 478.69 <NA> <unk> and we gradually displaced the beetle
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 478.48 481.38 <NA> by one hundred and eighty degrees
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 481.21 490.38 <NA> until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in in the first place <unk> and let 's see what his reaction is
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 489.95 492.99 <NA> as he 's headed through ninety degrees here 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 492.99 500.1 <NA> and now he 's going to when he ends up down here he 's going to be one hundred and eighty degrees in the wrong direction <unk> and see what his response is he
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 500.36 504.82 <NA> does a little dance he turns around and heads back in
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 504.89 507.58 <NA> he knows exactly where he 's going <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 507.09 516.7 <NA> he knows exactly what the problem is <unk> and he knows exactly how to deal with it and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 516.36 518.24 <NA> so
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 518.08 524.99 <NA> that 's the dance <unk> but after spending many years sitting in the african bush watching dung beetles on nice
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 525.79 535.82 <NA> <unk> we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior every now and then when they climb on top of the ball they wipe their face
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 537.25 542.87 <NA> and you see him do it again now we thought now what could be going on here
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 543.07 549.99 <NA> clearly the ground is very hot and when the ground is hot they dance more often <unk> and when they do this particular dance they wipe the bottom of
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 551.09 561.42 <NA> <unk> and we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior we thought that maybe what they 're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 561.14 566.46 <NA> so what we did was design a couple of arenas 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 566 574.96 <NA> one was hot one was cold we shaded this one we left that one hot <unk> and then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera <unk> so what you 're looking at
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 580.68 585.58 <NA> <unk> and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 585.75 590.77 <NA> so the truth is if you look at the temperature over here <unk> dung is cool 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 593.82 594.97 <NA> so
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 594.96 604.94 <NA> all we 're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background <unk> so the background here is around about fifty degrees centigrade the beetle itself
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 604.96 614.39 <NA> <unk> and the ball are probably around about thirty to thirty five degrees centigrade <unk> so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 614.39 622.31 <NA> it isn 't climbing it isn 't dancing <unk> because its body temperature is actually relatively low it 's about the same as yours and mine <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 622.72 626.76 <NA> and what 's of interest here is that little brain
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 626.55 629.94 <NA> is quite cool <unk> but if we contrast now what happens
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 630.4 632.76 <NA> in a hot environment 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 632.45 640.38 <NA> look at the temperature of the soil <unk> it 's up around fifty five to sixty degrees centigrade <unk> watch how often the beetle dances <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 641.42 645.6 <NA> and look at its front legs they 're roaringly hot <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 645.38 654.85 <NA> so the ball leaves a little thermal shadow <unk> and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face <unk> and all the time it 's trying to cool itself
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 654.81 663.42 <NA> <unk> down we think and avoid the hot sand that it 's walking across <unk> and what we did then was put little boots
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 663.43 668.21 <NA> on these legs <unk> because this was a way to test if the legs
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 667.85 671.77 <NA> were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 671.94 678.92 <NA> and if you look over here <unk> with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 679.84 685.27 <NA> <unk> so we described these as cool boots it was a dental compound that we used to make these boots <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 685.28 696.09 <NA> and we also cooled down the dung ball <unk> so we were able to put the ball in the fridge gave them a nice cool dung ball and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 695.88 701.52 <NA> so this is called stilting it 's a thermal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach we jump onto a
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 704.99 712.29 <NA> <unk> and then you scuttle across onto somebody else 's towel <unk> and that way you don 't burn your feet and that 's exactly what the beetles are doing here <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 712.16 717.82 <NA> however there 's one more story i 'd like to share with you and that 's this particular species 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 717.82 728.04 <NA> it 's from a genus called pachysoma there are thirteen species in the genus <unk> and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 728.51 729.79 <NA> this is a dung
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 730.26 732.37 <NA> watch what he 's doing 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 733.02 735.58 <NA> can you spot the difference 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 735.72 744.58 <NA> they don 't normally go this slowly it 's in slow motion but it 's walking forwards <unk> and it 's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 744.57 749.98 <NA> this is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior there
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 750.66 754.31 <NA> 's one more interesting aspect of this dung
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 754.96 762.6 <NA> <unk> behavior that we found quite fascinating <unk> and that 's that it forages and provisions a nest <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 762.6 767.3 <NA> so watch this individual here <unk> and what he 's trying to do is set up a nest 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 767.71 775.2 <NA> and he doesn 't like this first position <unk> but he comes up with a second position <unk> and about fifty minutes later that nest is finished
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 775.46 779.4 <NA> <unk> and he heads off to forage and provision
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 778.94 788.94 <NA> at a pile of dry dung pellets <unk> and what i want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path and compare the two 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 788.81 797.7 <NA> and by and large you 'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path on the outward path he 's always on the lookout
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 797.24 804.97 <NA> for a new blob of dung on the way home he knows where home is and he wants to go straight to it the
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 804.9 808.39 <NA> <unk> important thing here is that this is not a one way trip 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 807.9 816.05 <NA> as in most dung beetles the trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 816.05 820 <NA> and watch you 're going to see another south african crime taking place right now and
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 821.31 829.94 <NA> his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets so what we 're looking at here is a behavior
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 830.1 834.89 <NA> called path integration <unk> and what 's taking place is that the beetle
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 834.49 846.44 <NA> has got a home spot <unk> it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food <unk> and then when it finds food it heads straight home <unk> it knows exactly where its home is 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 846.44 849.57 <NA> now there 's two ways it could be doing that 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 849.33 854.64 <NA> and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it 's at the foraging site
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 855.14 858.6 <NA> <unk> if it 's using landmarks <unk> it will find its home <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 858.2 861.77 <NA> if it is using something called path integration <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 861.78 875.02 <NA> it will not find its home it will arrive at the wrong spot <unk> and what it 's doing here if it 's using path integration is it 's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction it knows the bearing home <unk> and it knows it should be in that
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 875.73 887.23 <NA> <unk> if you displace it it ends up in the wrong place <unk> so let 's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment so here 's our cunning experimenter <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 888.48 891.37 <NA> he displaces the beetle <unk>

MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 896.11 904.61 <NA> <unk> what we 've got is a burrow that 's where the forage was the forage has been displaced to a new position <unk> if he 's using landmark orientation
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 904.72 908.92 <NA> <unk> should be able to find the burrow because he 'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 908.92 917.96 <NA> if he 's using path integration then it should end up in the wrong spot over here <unk> so let 's watch what happens
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 917.59 925.17 <NA> when we put the beetle through the whole test so there he is there he 's about to head home
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 932.15 938.85 <NA> <unk> it hasn 't a clue <unk> it starts to search for its house in the right distance away from
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 938.51 948.06 <NA> the food but it is clearly completely lost <unk> so we know now that this animal uses path integration
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 947.66 953.22 <NA> to find its way around <unk> and the callous experimenter leads it top left
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 953.34 954.34 <NA> and
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 955.02 956.47 <NA> <unk> we 're looking at here
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 956.58 962.71 <NA> are a group of animals that use a compass and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around <unk> 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 962.22 974.83 <NA> and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance <unk> and we know that these species here actually count the steps that 's what they use as an odometer a step counting system 
MarcusByrne_2012X 1 MarcusByrne_2012X 974.83 979.97 <NA> to find their way back home <unk> we don 't know yet what dung
