AmitSood_2011 1 AmitSood_2011 295.55 299.15 <NA> it really comes from these artists <unk> and
AmitSood_2011 1 AmitSood_2011 298.9 299.9 <NA> that 's been my
AmitSood_2011 1 AmitSood_2011 300 310.45 <NA> <unk> humbling experience in this i mean i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online and the biggest question i get asked nowadays
AmitSood_2011 1 AmitSood_2011 310.46 318.93 <NA> is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum and the answer is no it 's to supplement the experience and that 's it
