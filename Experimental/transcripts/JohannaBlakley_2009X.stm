JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 37.05 41.01 <NA> said i 'll buy it but i 'm also going to replicate it
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 42.05 47.13 <NA> now the academics in this audience may think well that sounds like plagiarism
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 46.67 54.88 <NA> but to a fashionista what it really is is a sign prada 's genius that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 54.99 60.16 <NA> <unk> that doesn 't need to be changed by one iota and to be current and to be now
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 60 63.85 <NA> you might also be asking whether it 's possible
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 63.54 66.94 <NA> that this is illegal for her to do this
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 66.45 73.87 <NA> well it turns out that it 's actually not illegal in the fashion industry there 's very little intellectual property protection
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 73.62 79.76 <NA> they have trademark protection but no copyright protection and no patent
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 79.72 89.9 <NA> <unk> protection to speak of all they have really is trademark protection and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell <unk>
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 89.8 97.55 <NA> <unk> it as their own design the only thing that they can 't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 105.31 112.41 <NA> because they can 't knock off the logo but if you go to santee alley yeah well yeah
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 112.76 117.63 <NA> canal street i know and sometimes these are fun right
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 118.1 125.55 <NA> now the reason for this the reason that the fashion industry doesn 't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 125.15 130 <NA> that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection they didn
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 130.07 139.93 <NA> 't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing and then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because joe blow owns it
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 140.79 151.06 <NA> but too utilitarian i mean is that the way you think of fashion this is vivienne westwood no we think of it as maybe too silly too unnecessary
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 150.72 154.97 <NA> now those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 155.19 158.81 <NA> which is that without ownership there is no incentive to innovate
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 158.81 166.19 <NA> might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 165.85 180 <NA> what i 'm going to argue today is that because there is no copyright protection in the fashion industry fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design things to cover our naked bodies into something
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 180.01 185.22 <NA> we consider art because there 's no copyright protection in this industry
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 184.82 189.25 <NA> there 's a very open and creative ecology of creativity
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 189.25 197.05 <NA> unlike their creative brothers and sisters who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 196.81 204.97 <NA> fashion designers can sample from all their peers designs they can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 204.93 207.43 <NA> <unk> incorporate it into their own design
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 207.15 215.8 <NA> they 're also notorious for you know riffing off of the zeitgeist and here i suspect they were influenced by the costumes in avatar
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 215.8 219.7 <NA> maybe just a little can 't copyright a costume either
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 219.6 228.62 <NA> now fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry this wedding dress here is actually made of sporks
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 230.05 236.9 <NA> <unk> and this dress is actually made of aluminum i 've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 237.1 250.61 <NA> so one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying which is really what it is is the establishment of trends people think this is a magical thing how does it happen well it 's because it 's legal for people to copy one another
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 250.42 254.97 <NA> some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain

JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 258.01 266.31 <NA> but if you talk to any designer at any level including these high end designers they always say their main inspiration comes from the street
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 266.31 270.81 <NA> where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 270.32 278.76 <NA> and that 's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration so it 's both a top down and a bottom up kind of industry
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 278.97 279.97 <NA> now the
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 279.93 286.2 <NA> <unk> fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry

JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 293.96 302.5 <NA> but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers the courts have said over and over again you don 't need any more intellectual property protection
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 302.28 304.61 <NA> when you look at copies like this
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 305.22 312.01 <NA> 's like you wonder how do the luxury high end brands remain in business if you can get it for two hundred bucks why pay a thousand

JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 365.34 370.57 <NA> charming aspects can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 370.11 372.79 <NA> there 's lots of virtues of copying
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 372.57 380 <NA> one that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design
JohannaBlakley_2009X 1 JohannaBlakley_2009X 380.08 385.13 <NA> <unk> choices to choose from than we ever have before and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry actually
