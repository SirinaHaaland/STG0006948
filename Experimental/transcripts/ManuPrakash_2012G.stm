ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 125.16 128.56 <NA> <unk> really hard to maintain <unk> and cost a lot of money 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 128.58 137.17 <NA> this picture is mahatma gandhi in the ' 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing t b

ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 143.91 154.94 <NA> traveled around india and thailand starting to think about this problem a lot we saw all kinds of donated equipment we saw fungus growing on microscope lenses and we saw people
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 154.87 158.9 <NA> <unk> who had a functional microscope but just didn 't know how to even turn it on 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 158.74 165.41 <NA> what grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call foldscopes 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 165.01 174.81 <NA> so what is a foldscope a foldscope is a completely functional microscope a platform for fluorescence bright field polarization
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 175.73 180.87 <NA> <unk> all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 180.86 184.29 <NA> so now you think how is that possible i
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 183.95 191.61 <NA> 'm going to show you some examples here and we will run through some of them it starts with a single sheet of paper 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 191.54 199.5 <NA> what you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright field and fluorescence microscope <unk> 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 200.43 211.45 <NA> <unk> there are three stages there is the optical stage the illumination stage and the mask holding stage and there are micro optics at the bottom that 's actually embedded in the paper itself 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 211.2 217.78 <NA> what you do is you take it on and just like you are playing like a toy <unk> which
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 217.98 223.27 <NA> it is i tab it off <unk> 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 226.59 229.97 <NA> and i break it off this paper
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 230.01 238.31 <NA> has no instructions and no languages there is a code a color code embedded that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 238.63 246.22 <NA> when it 's done it looks something like this has all the functionalities of a standard microscope just like an xy stage 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 246.22 250.28 <NA> a place where a sample slide could go 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 250.15 254.52 <NA> for example right here we didn 't want to change this
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 255.02 266.13 <NA> <unk> this is the standard that 's been optimized for over the years <unk> and many health workers are actually used to this so this is what changes but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 265.64 267.57 <NA> you pop this in 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 268.55 271.44 <NA> there is an xy stage 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 273.05 275.05 <NA> and then there is a focusing stage
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 275.01 282.28 <NA> <unk> which is a flexure mechanism that 's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps <unk> 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 281.94 291.56 <NA> so what 's really interesting about this object and my students hate when i do this but i 'm going to do this anyway is these are rugged devices i can turn it on
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 291.32 293.62 <NA> and throw it on the floor
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 294.15 296.47 <NA> and really try to stomp on it 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 297.03 304.88 <NA> and they last even though they 're designed from a very flexible material like paper <unk> another fun fact is
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 304.99 309.32 <NA> <unk> this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 309.94 317.72 <NA> but here in this envelope i have thirty different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder <unk> 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 319.81 329.85 <NA> and i 'm going to pick one randomly this one it turns out is actually designed specifically for malaria because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 329.99 335.49 <NA> <unk> so the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 335.42 345.63 <NA> so up till now you didn 't actually see what i would see from one of these setups <unk> so what i would like to do is if we could dim the lights please it turns <unk>
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 345.53 354.67 <NA> <unk> out foldscopes are also projection microscopes i have these two microscopes that i 'm going to turn go to the back of the wall and just project and this way you will see
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 355.08 358.27 <NA> <unk> what i would see what you 're looking at 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 360.42 370.91 <NA> this is a cross section of a compound eye <unk> and when i 'm going to zoom in closer <unk> right there i am going through the z axis you actually see how the lenses are cut together
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 370.91 379.64 <NA> in the cross section pattern another example one of my favorite insects i love to hate this one is a mosquito and
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 379.93 383.93 <NA> <unk> you 're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens right there 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 385.87 389.66 <NA> all from the simple setup that i actually described 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 389.89 393.74 <NA> so my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 393.76 399.99 <NA> by washing my clothes whenever i forget them in the dryer <unk> so it turns out they
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 404 412.71 <NA> <unk> right here is just fluorescent water <unk> and i don 't know if you can actually see this this also shows you how the projection scope works you get to see the beam the way it 's projected and bent 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 415.88 418.17 <NA> can we get the lights back on again <unk> 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 418.76 424.9 <NA> so i 'm quickly going to show you since i 'm running out of time <unk> in terms of how much it costs for us to
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 435.33 445.45 <NA> <unk> allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy which we call use and throw microscopy i 'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in here is <unk>
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 445.35 454.73 <NA> <unk> a sheet of paper this is when we were thinking about the idea this is an a4 sheet of paper these are the three stages that you actually see and the optical components if you look at the inset up on the
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 455.07 465.2 <NA> we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs so it uses a process of self assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in <unk>
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 465.1 475.14 <NA> <unk> the paper itself <unk> so that 's where the lenses go there are some light sources and essentially in the end all the parts line up because of origami because of the fact
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 480.38 487.56 <NA> <unk> so even though this looks like a simple toy <unk> the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated <unk> 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 487.25 497.58 <NA> so here is another obvious thing that we would do typically if i was going to show that these microscopes are robust is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself <unk> 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 497.33 500.32 <NA> there it is and it survives
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 501.18 507.31 <NA> <unk> so for us the next step actually is really finishing our field trials we are starting at the end of the summer 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 506.82 516.88 <NA> we are at a stage where we 'll be making thousands of microscopes that would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place we
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 516.51 521.98 <NA> 've started collecting data for malaria <unk> chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves 
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 522.36 528.98 <NA> and i want to leave you with this picture i had not anticipated this before but a really interesting link between
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 529.84 534.43 <NA> <unk> education and global health what are the tools that we 're actually providing
ManuPrakash_2012G 1 ManuPrakash_2012G 534.44 543.6 <NA> the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow i would love for them to be able to just print out a foldscope and carry them around in their pockets <unk> thank you
