ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 162.16 166.7 <NA> and then telling me this story frankie said you know god 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 167.44 174.72 <NA> drugs really make you stupid and you know you can 't fault him for accuracy
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 177.68 189.02 <NA> <unk> at that time was a heroin addict and he was in jail so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high <unk> and if there 's one place you really want to get high it 's when you 're in jail <unk> 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 189.03 195.64 <NA> but i 'm a scientist and i don 't like to make data out of anecdotes so let 's look at some data
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 195.46 199.66 <NA> <unk> we talked to six hundred drug addicts in three cities in
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 204.45 207.04 <NA> <unk> nearly one hundred percent yeah by sharing needles 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 207.04 214.72 <NA> and do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that oh yeah hundred percent we 're smackheads we know where to get clean needles 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 214.44 222.79 <NA> so are you carrying a needle we 're actually interviewing people on the street in the places where they 're hanging out and taking drugs are you carrying clean needles

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 226.45 236.6 <NA> <unk> so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in ten and the other <unk>
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 236.55 245.49 <NA> nine in ten are sharing so you 've got this massive mismatch everyone knows that if they share they 're going to get hiv but they 're all sharing anyway <unk> 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 252.56 259.17 <NA> <unk> want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you 're sleeping with there 's just kind of an ick factor there no <unk>
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 260.38 262.8 <NA> we share needles because we don 't want to go to jail 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 263.03 266.79 <NA> so in indonesia at this time 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 266.45 274.74 <NA> if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up they could put you into jail and that changes the equation slightly doesn 't it because
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 274.76 279.94 <NA> your choice now is either i use my own needle now
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 279.95 290.27 <NA> or i could i could share a needle now and and get a disease that 's going to possibly kill me ten years from now <unk> or i could use my own needle now and

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 291.99 304.97 <NA> and while junkies think that it 's a really bad idea to expose themselves to hiv <unk> they think it 's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they 'll probably end up in frankie 's situation and expose themselves to hiv
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 305.22 309.63 <NA> anyway <unk> so suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles <unk> 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 309.42 320.03 <NA> now let 's look at it from a policy maker 's point of view this is a really easy problem for once your incentives are aligned we 've got what 's rational for public health <unk>
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 319.98 329.97 <NA> you want people to use clean needles and junkies want to use clean needles <unk> so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 401.45 409.11 <NA> <unk> where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens we 've taken a very different approach

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 467.89 474.93 <NA> so it becomes quite rational to to deny services to injectors now let 's talk about

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 563.65 573 <NA> because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups and that 's considered stigmatizing
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 573.05 578.38 <NA> i 've always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing whereas lots of sex is

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 579.89 581.83 <NA> we 'll leave that be 
ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 581.94 593.29 <NA> the truth is that twenty years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 769.23 779.34 <NA> what we 've got some people say oh it doesn 't matter very much because actually treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit hiv

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 842.73 850.2 <NA> is that actually condom use rates which were very very high the gay community responded very rapidly to hiv

ElizabethPisani_2010 1 ElizabethPisani_2010 853.94 865.98 <NA> that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really one is the assumption of oh well if he 's infected he 's probably on meds and his viral load 's going to be low so i 'm pretty safe
