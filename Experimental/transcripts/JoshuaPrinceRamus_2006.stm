JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 17.7 25.62 <NA> and i want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation the first is what i like to call a hyper rational process it 's a process that
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 25.38 29.79 <NA> takes rationality almost to an absurd level and it transcends all the
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 29.75 39.34 <NA> <unk> baggage that normally comes with what people would call sort of a rational conclusion to something and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn 't expect as being
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 39.34 43.38 <NA> the result of rationality the second
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 44.21 45.81 <NA> the second
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 45.86 54.97 <NA> is that this process does not have a signature <unk> there is no authorship architects are obsessed with authorship <unk> this is something that has editing and it has
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 54.96 60.55 <NA> <unk> teams but in fact we no longer see within this process the traditional master architect creating
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 60.06 62.86 <NA> a sketch that his minions carry out 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 63.24 70.3 <NA> and the third is that it challenges and this is in the length of this very hard to to support why <unk> connect all these things
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 70.14 79.19 <NA> but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility <unk> high modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic almost anything can happen within them i call
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 79.87 81.92 <NA> <unk> flexibility <unk> turn your
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 81.43 91.13 <NA> head this way shoot and you 're bound to kill something so this is the promise of high modernism within a single space actually any kind of activity can happen but as we 're seeing 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 91.48 96.95 <NA> operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters and
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 96.67 104.76 <NA> so with this sort of idea what happens is whatever actually is in the building on opening day or whatever seems to be the most immediate need starts to
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 104.72 113.43 <NA> <unk> dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it of anything else could ever happen <unk> and so we 're proposing a different kind of flexibility something that we call
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 113.3 115.51 <NA> compartmentalized
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 115.32 127.53 <NA> flexibility and the idea is that you within that continuum identify a series of points and you design specifically to them they can be pushed off center a little bit but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 127.22 129.85 <NA> as you originally had hoped with high modernist
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 129.81 132.04 <NA> <unk> flexibility <unk> that doesn 't really work now
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 132.09 141.7 <NA> i 'm going to talk about i 'm going to build up the seattle central library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams and i truly mean this is the design process that you 'll see 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 141.24 150.02 <NA> with the library staff and the library board we settled on two core positions this is the first one and this is showing over the last nine hundred years the evolution of the
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 153.1 159.98 <NA> <unk> this diagram was our sort of position piece about the book and our position was books are technology that 's something people forget
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 159.78 166.91 <NA> but it 's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 166.66 175.88 <NA> the second premise and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first is that libraries since the inception of carnegie library tradition in america 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 175.72 179.46 <NA> had a second responsibility and that was for social roles
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 180.1 186 <NA> come back to later <unk> but something actually the librarians at first said no this isn 't our mandate our mandate is
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 185.93 193.29 <NA> media and particularly the book so what you 're seeing now is actually the design of the building the upper diagram
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 193.16 200.08 <NA> is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility sort of
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 200.16 202.33 <NA> <unk> any activity could happen anywhere
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 202.14 215.26 <NA> <unk> we don 't know the future of the library we don 't know the future of the book <unk> and so we 'll use this approach <unk> and what we saw were buildings that were very generic and worse not only were they very generic so not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 214.83 216.82 <NA> the magazine area
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 216.6 224.84 <NA> but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it and in this
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 225.25 233.63 <NA> <unk> was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book <unk> and so we proposed what 's at the lower diagram very dumb approach <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 233.29 243.65 <NA> simply compartmentalize put those things whose evolution we could predict and i don 't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future <unk>
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 243.6 250.52 <NA> put those in boxes designed specifically for it and put the things that we can 't predict on the rooftops <unk> so that was the core idea 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 254.81 264.9 <NA> <unk> important to media in order to get them to accept this what you 're seeing here is actually their program on the left that 's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 264.89 271.71 <NA> <unk> our first operation was to re digest it back to them show it to them and say you know what we haven 't touched it <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 271.71 274.99 <NA> but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 275.94 282.38 <NA> <unk> of it is already dedicated that 's the white band below the thing you said isn 't important is already dedicated to social functions 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 282.38 291.79 <NA> so once we had presented that back to them they agreed that this sort of core concept could work we got the right to go back to first principles that 's the third diagram we recombined everything <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 291.39 300.05 <NA> and then we started making new decisions what you 're seeing on the right is the design of the library specifically in terms of square footage on the left of that diagram
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 301.9 312.38 <NA> <unk> a series of five platforms sort of combs collective programs and on the right are the more indeterminate spaces things like reading rooms whose evolution in twenty thirty forty years we can 't predict <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 311.89 319.88 <NA> so that literally was the design of the building they signed it and to their chagrin we came back a week later and we presented them this
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 319.69 324.99 <NA> and as you can see it is literally the diagram on the right we just sized no really i mean
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 328.85 340.44 <NA> <unk> those are the boxes we sized them into five compartments they 're super efficient we had a very low budget to work with we pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships the reading room should be able to see the water 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 340.22 346.02 <NA> the main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code and so forth <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 346.13 350.08 <NA> so you see the five platforms those are the boxes within each one a very discrete
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 350 356.95 <NA> <unk> thing is happening <unk> the area in between is sort of an urban continuum these things that we can 't predict their evolution to the same degree 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 356.97 368.17 <NA> to give you some sense of the power of this idea the biggest block block is what we call the book spiral it 's literally built in a very inexpensive way it is a parking garage for books it
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 367.77 369.34 <NA> just so happens to be on the <unk>
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 370.26 379.97 <NA> <unk> of the building but that is not necessarily an expensive approach <unk> and it allows us to organize the entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it grows
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 380.05 387.47 <NA> <unk> or contracts within the building <unk> it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we 've all experienced in public libraries 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 389.62 394.58 <NA> and so this was the final operation which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 394.36 399.9 <NA> <unk> and to hold onto them with a skin that skin serves double duty again for economics
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 400.67 409.11 <NA> <unk> is the lateral stability for the entire building it 's a structural element but its dimensions were designed not only for structure but also for holding on every piece of glass
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 409.16 417.22 <NA> <unk> the glass was then i 'll use the word impregnated but it had a layer of metal that was called stretched metal that metal acts as a microlouver 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 417.22 422.85 <NA> so from the exterior of the building the sun sees it as totally opaque but from the interior it 's entirely transparent 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 422.93 424.39 <NA> so now i 'm going to
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 424.15 429.97 <NA> take you on a tour of the building let me see if i can find it for anyone who gets motion
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 430.05 433.57 <NA> <unk> sickness i apologize so this is the building <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 435.6 438.73 <NA> and i think what 's important is when we first unveiled the building <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 438.73 444.01 <NA> the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 443.73 452.99 <NA> and it was defended believe it or not by the librarians they said look we don 't know what it is but we know it 's everything that we need it to be based on the observations that we 've done about the program
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 456.61 457.79 <NA> is
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 457.45 462.68 <NA> going into one of the entries so it 's an unusual building for a public library obviously <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 465.46 474.13 <NA> so now we 're going into what we call the living room this is actually a program that we invented with the library it was recognizing that public libraries
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 474.13 479.88 <NA> are the last vestige of public free space there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 483.26 491.88 <NA> free places that allow you to get out of the rain so this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything including eat yell play chess and so forth <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 491.69 495.3 <NA> now we 're moving up into what we call

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 530.07 535.49 <NA> i can very quickly get into the book spiral because i think it 's as i said the most this is the main reading room
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 535.12 542.64 <NA> the most unique part of the building <unk> you dizzy yet ok so here this is the book spiral
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 554.87 558.48 <NA> <unk> one city block go up one full floor so that it 's on a continuum ok

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 566.6 569.94 <NA> to go very very quickly through this now this is the
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 569.57 574.53 <NA> dallas theater it was an unusual client for us because they came to us and they said 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 574.22 579.97 <NA> we need you to do a new building <unk> we 've been working in a temporary space for thirty years <unk> but because
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 580.14 583.1 <NA> <unk> of that temporary space we 've become an infamous theater
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 582.92 589.27 <NA> company theater is really focused in new york <unk> chicago and seattle with the exception of the dallas theater company 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 589.83 599.93 <NA> and the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for beckett they could blow out a wall they could do cherry orchard and blow a hole through the floor and so forth <unk> so it was a very daunting task for us to do a
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 603.13 610.73 <NA> <unk> be a pristine building but keep this kind of experimental nature <unk> and the second is they were what we call a multi form theater they do
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 610.56 622.44 <NA> different kinds of performances in repertory so they in the morning will do something in arena then they 'll do something in proscenium and so forth and so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 622.44 624.8 <NA> and for operational budget reasons 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 624.34 629.73 <NA> this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi form theater in the united states so we needed to figure out a way
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 631.01 639.52 <NA> so our thought was to literally put the theater on its head to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 639.52 650.35 <NA> and to create what we called a theater machine we invest the money in the operation of the building it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere wherever you place it the area under it is charged for theatrical performances
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 650.96 657.34 <NA> allowed us to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light enclosure and so forth 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 657.39 664.57 <NA> and at the push of a button <unk> it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium thrust and in fact arena
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 664.2 666.52 <NA> and traverse and flat floor 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 666.51 674.9 <NA> in a very quick transfiguration so in fact using operational budget we can sorry capital cost we can actually achieve what
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 678.37 680.21 <NA> <unk> the artistic director now has
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 679.98 691.76 <NA> a palette that he or she can choose from between a series of forms and a series of processions because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front of house and back of house spaces has been liberated <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 691.42 702.38 <NA> so an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a wagnerian procession <unk> shows the first first act in thrust <unk> the intermission in a greek procession

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 714.08 721.17 <NA> the light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure so you can do beckett with dallas as the backdrop 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 721.64 725.67 <NA> portions can be opened so you can now actually have motorcycles

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 920.86 929.94 <NA> so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown and make circulation connections and reroute the road <unk> so that 's the basic concept and now i 'm going to show
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 929.99 931.56 <NA> <unk> you what it leads to ok it
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 932.6 942.66 <NA> seems a very formal willful gesture but something derived entirely out of the constraints and again when we unveiled it there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 942.26 946.35 <NA> not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 946.67 949.87 <NA> now within that center zone as i said we have the
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 956.31 962.38 <NA> <unk> they told us the dimensions the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all the public components the lobbies the bars
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 962.22 967.04 <NA> everything that different commercial elements would have and combined it in the center 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 967.04 972.22 <NA> in the sort of subway map in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 972.3 976.84 <NA> so it creates a situation like this where you have artists who can operate within
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 976.98 979.61 <NA> an art space that also has an amazing view on the
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 979.86 988.97 <NA> 22nd floor <unk> but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close <unk> it allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art and so forth
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 988.77 997.46 <NA> it also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool so they 're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 997.46 1000.02 <NA> gallery space <unk> so how
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1001.33 1004.58 <NA> <unk> it 's very simple <unk> it 's a chair so we begin
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1004.3 1006.26 <NA> by building the cores as
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1006.25 1014.27 <NA> we 're building the cores we build the contemporary art museum at grade <unk> that allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency this is not a high budget building 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1014.2 1025.31 <NA> the moment the cores get to mid level <unk> we finish the art museum we put all the mechanical equipment in it and then we jack it up into the air this is how they build really large aircraft hangars for instance the ones that they did for the a380 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1025.36 1028.28 <NA> finish the cores <unk> finish the meat
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1028 1029.85 <NA> and you get something that looks like this
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1029.86 1035.58 <NA> now i only have about thirty seconds so i want to start an animation and we 'll conclude with that thank you chris asked me to add
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006 1042.23 1048.61 <NA> the theater is under construction and this project will start construction in about a year <unk> and finish in two thousand and ten
