JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 41.3 50.23 <NA> and then goods became the predominant economic offering <unk> where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods
JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 50.97 59.38 <NA> <unk> we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy well what then happened over the last fifty or sixty years is that goods have become commoditized commoditized

JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 69.18 74.96 <NA> now there 's an antidote to commoditization <unk> and that is customization <unk> my first book was called
JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 76.03 82.34 <NA> <unk> came up a couple of times yesterday and how i discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good
JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 82.17 94.58 <NA> automatically turned it into a service <unk> because it was done just for a particular person because it wasn 't inventoried it was delivered on demand to that individual person so we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy but
JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 94.24 100.02 <NA> over the past ten or twenty years what 's happened is that services are being commoditized as well

JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 111.43 119.24 <NA> what that means is that it 's time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services 
JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 119.24 129.7 <NA> and use in that same heuristic what happens when you customize a service what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person that 's exactly what they need at this moment in time then you can 't help but make them go

JosephPine_2004 1 JosephPine_2004 229.96 238.67 <NA> <unk> inside of us it 's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us so as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings then every experience we have is authentic now
