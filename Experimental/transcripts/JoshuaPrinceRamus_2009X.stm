JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 72.15 79.73 <NA> so as we have faced liability we have stepped back and back and unfortunately where there is liability guess what there is

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 91.27 103.2 <NA> and so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture and we announced hey architecture it 's over here in this autonomous language we 're going to seed control of processes

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 349.19 354.97 <NA> now the first issue that we faced was that the dallas theater center had a notoriety that

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 370.95 375.92 <NA> why was this horrible horrible little building so important to their
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 375.69 379.97 <NA> renown and their innovation because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 415.85 425.05 <NA> the second issue is a nuance of the first <unk> and that 's that the company and the building was multiform that meant that they were able to perform

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 442.29 449.75 <NA> so they stopped having inexpensive labor and eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 451.36 461.78 <NA> <unk> the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided the ability to move between stage configurations had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 465.21 467.39 <NA> was frankly just dumb 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 467.14 477.32 <NA> it was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house at first blush you think hey it 's crazy what could you possibly gain 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 476.83 479.79 <NA> we created what we like to call superfly
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 480.95 488.32 <NA> now superfly the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower and you smear them across flytower and auditorium <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 488.32 494.79 <NA> suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations <unk>

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 506.76 516.22 <NA> but there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected <unk> and that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way <unk> 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 516.48 521.74 <NA> and that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 521.73 529.94 <NA> so the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object <unk> but also
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 530.04 532.53 <NA> to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 549.4 552.84 <NA> they had to make a decision based on the positions we took
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 552.66 554.91 <NA> to redefine the budget being from two

JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 562.68 568.69 <NA> that 's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 568.5 573.28 <NA> but based on the positions they took the educated leap of faith to do so 
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 1 JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X 573.07 577.05 <NA> and effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine
