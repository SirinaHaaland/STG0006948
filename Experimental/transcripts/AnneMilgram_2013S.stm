AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 24.61 29.97 <NA> but when i became the attorney general two things happened that changed the way i see criminal
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 30.7 35.23 <NA> the first is that i asked what i thought were really basic questions <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 35.23 43.2 <NA> i wanted to understand who we were arresting who we were charging and who we were putting in our nation 's jails and prisons <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 42.77 48.72 <NA> i also wanted to understand if we were making decisions in a way that made us safer <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 48.47 50.08 <NA> and i couldn 't get this
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 51.93 59.11 <NA> <unk> it turned out that most big criminal justice agencies like my own didn 't track the things that matter 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 58.74 66.23 <NA> so after about a month of being incredibly frustrated i walked down into a conference room that was filled with detectives
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 65.9 68.78 <NA> and stacks and stacks of case files 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 68.78 79.04 <NA> and the detectives were sitting there with yellow legal pads taking notes <unk> they were trying to get the information i was looking for by going through case by case for the past five years
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 79.93 83.84 <NA> <unk> as you can imagine when we finally got the results <unk> they weren 't good <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 83.44 90.5 <NA> it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 90.52 100.29 <NA> the second thing that happened is that i spent the day in the camden new jersey police department now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 100.76 104.28 <NA> <unk> i ran the camden police department because of that 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 104.03 114.15 <NA> i spent the day in the police department <unk> and i was taken into a room with senior police officials all of whom were working hard and trying very hard to reduce crime in camden <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 114.02 118.08 <NA> and what i saw in that room as we talked about how to reduce crime 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 118.08 126.7 <NA> were a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes <unk> and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 126.46 129.97 <NA> and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago we have no suspects
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 130.22 135.7 <NA> and another said we had a shooting in this neighborhood last week we have no suspects 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 135.24 142.3 <NA> we weren 't using data driven policing we were essentially trying to fight crime with yellow post it notes <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 142.29 148.09 <NA> now both of these things made me realize fundamentally that we were failing <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 147.78 154.97 <NA> we didn 't even know who was in our criminal justice system we didn 't have any data about the things that mattered and we

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 160.84 165.47 <NA> and for the first time i started to think about how we made decisions 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 164.98 175.02 <NA> when i was an assistant d a and when i was a federal prosecutor <unk> i looked at the cases in front of me <unk> and i generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience when
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 175 184.05 <NA> became attorney general i could look at the system as a whole <unk> and what surprised me is that i found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 183.59 188.82 <NA> in police departments in prosecutors 's offices in courts and in jails 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 188.99 194.4 <NA> and what i learned very quickly is that we weren 't doing a good job <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 194.54 196.99 <NA> so i wanted to do things differently <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 196.99 204.97 <NA> i wanted to introduce data and analytics and rigorous statistical analysis into our work in short i wanted to moneyball criminal justice
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 205.47 214.42 <NA> now moneyball as many of you know is what the oakland a 's did where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 214.22 224.65 <NA> and they went from a system that was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience the scouts ' instincts and experience to pick players from one to use <unk>

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 234.16 238.76 <NA> we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 238.56 244.91 <NA> we reduced murders there by forty one percent <unk> which actually means thirty seven lives were saved <unk>

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 248.35 254.76 <NA> we also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions <unk> so we went from doing low level drug crimes that were outside our

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 338.9 351.27 <NA> so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions <unk> and i came back to thinking about how we had used data and analytics to transform the way we did criminal justice in new jersey <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 350.99 354.73 <NA> and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 364.17 368.27 <NA> so i decided to focus on using data and analytics
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 368.11 374.96 <NA> to help make the most critical decision in public safety and that decision is the determination of whether when
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 376.75 383.96 <NA> <unk> whether they pose a risk to public safety and should be detained or whether they don 't pose a risk to public safety and should be released <unk>

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 394.51 404.43 <NA> and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now <unk> they all say the same thing which is that we put dangerous people in jail <unk> and we let

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 409.38 419.7 <NA> but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don 't have when we start to look at the data what we find time and time again is that this isn 't the case 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 419.3 425.08 <NA> we find low risk offenders which makes up fifty percent of our entire criminal justice population
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 425.37 433 <NA> <unk> we find that they 're in jail take leslie chew who was a texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 432.63 440.35 <NA> he was arrested <unk> and he was kept in jail on three thousand five hundred dollars bail an amount that he could not afford to pay <unk>

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 465.7 474.96 <NA> the reason for this is the way we make decisions judges have the best intentions when they make these decisions about risk but they 're making them subjectively <unk>
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 475.43 482.71 <NA> <unk> they 're like the baseball scouts twenty years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses <unk>

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 489.17 493.66 <NA> what we need in this space are strong data and analytics 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 493.66 504.97 <NA> what i decided to look for was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool something that would let judges actually understand with a scientific and objective way what the risk was that was posed
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 505.02 514.54 <NA> <unk> by someone in front of them i looked all over the country and i found that between five and ten percent of all u s jurisdictions actually use any type of risk assessment tool <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 514.2 520.96 <NA> and when i looked at these tools i quickly realized why <unk> they were unbelievably expensive to administer <unk> they were <unk>
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 521.96 524.84 <NA> they were limited to the local jurisdiction in which they 'd been
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 525.73 529.4 <NA> <unk> so basically they couldn 't be scaled or transferred to other places <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 529.27 538.23 <NA> so i went out and built a phenomenal team of data scientists and researchers and statisticians to build a universal risk assessment tool <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 538.23 545.09 <NA> so that every single judge in the united states of america can have an objective scientific measure of risk 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 544.9 554.97 <NA> in the tool that we 've built <unk> what we did was we collected one point five million cases from all around the united states from cities from counties from every single state in the country the federal
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 554.99 564.33 <NA> <unk> districts <unk> and with those one point five million cases which is the largest data set on pretrial in the united states today we were able to basically find that there were <unk>

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 569.81 579.94 <NA> and we found that there were nine specific things that mattered all across the country and that were the most highly predictive of risk and so we built a universal risk assessment

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 580.8 582.62 <NA> and it looks like this 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 582.38 592.9 <NA> as you 'll see we put some information in but most of it is incredibly simple it 's easy to use it focuses on things like the defendant 's prior convictions whether they 've been sentenced <unk>

AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 604.93 615.59 <NA> <unk> for the first time and i think this is incredibly important <unk> we can predict whether someone will commit an act of violence if they 're released <unk> and that 's the single most important thing that judges say when you talk to them <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 615.1 619.22 <NA> and third we can predict whether someone will come back to court <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 618.79 625.05 <NA> and every single judge in the united states of america can use it because it 's been created on a universal data set
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 625.85 630.57 <NA> <unk> what judges see if they run the risk assessment tool is this it 's a dashboard 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 630.37 635.25 <NA> at the top you see the new criminal activity score <unk> six of course being the highest 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 635.25 643.65 <NA> and then in the middle you see elevated risk of violence what that says is that this person is someone who has an elevated risk of violence that the judge should look twice at 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 643.22 650.25 <NA> and then towards the bottom you see the failure to appear score <unk> which again is the likelihood that someone will come back to court <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 650.72 654.97 <NA> now i want to say something really important it 's not that i think we
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 654.93 661.09 <NA> <unk> should be eliminating the judge 's instinct and experience from this process <unk> i don 't 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 660.72 674.86 <NA> i actually believe the problem that we see and the reason that we have these incredible system errors where we 're incarcerating low level nonviolent people and we 're releasing high risk dangerous people is that we don 't have an objective measure of risk <unk> 
AnneMilgram_2013S 1 AnneMilgram_2013S 674.86 679.19 <NA> but what i believe should happen is that we should take that data driven risk assessment
