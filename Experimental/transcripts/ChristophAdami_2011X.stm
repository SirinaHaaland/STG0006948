ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 315.82 324.63 <NA> <unk> virus infections was that if you look at the rate at which the infection worked they show this spiky behavior that you 're used to from a flu virus <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 325.13 335.06 <NA> <unk> it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth <unk> and the result is kind of a tree of life
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 334.9 342.46 <NA> of these viruses a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we 're used to at least on the viral level 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 342.46 350.17 <NA> so is that life not as far as i 'm concerned why <unk> because these things don 't evolve by themselves <unk> in fact they have hackers writing
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 350.67 360.82 <NA> <unk> but the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further <unk> when a scientist working at the santa fe institute decided why don 't we try to package these little viruses in <unk>
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 360.72 374.96 <NA> <unk> artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve and this was steen rasmussen <unk> and he designed this system but it really didn 't work <unk> because his viruses were constantly destroying each other <unk> but there was another scientist who had been watching this an ecologist <unk> and he
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 375.91 387.38 <NA> <unk> i know how to fix this and he wrote the tierra system and in my book is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems except for the fact that these programs didn 't really grow in complexity <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 387.38 400.2 <NA> so having seen this work worked a little bit on this this is where i came in and i decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see in fact <unk> the evolution of complexity <unk> more

ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 429.9 436.48 <NA> <unk> well i can 't really go into the details <unk> but what you see here is some of the entrails but what i wanted to focus on
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 436.31 444.24 <NA> is this type of population structure there 's about ten thousand programs sitting here and all different strains are colored in different colors 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 444.24 450.02 <NA> and as you see here there are groups that are growing on top of each other because they are spreading any time there

ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 458.23 462.11 <NA> so i 'm going to show you a movie where you 're going to see that kind of dynamic <unk> and <unk>
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 463.39 471.32 <NA> <unk> of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves <unk> we write our own stuff replicate it and are very proud of ourselves and we put them in 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 471.32 479.97 <NA> and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation by the way this is highly accelerated so it 's like a one thousand generations a second
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 480.04 491.89 <NA> but immediately the system goes like what kind of dumb piece of code was this this can be improved upon in so many ways so quickly so you see waves of new types taking over the other types 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 491.89 495.48 <NA> and this type of activity goes on for quite a while until
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 495.08 500.02 <NA> the main easy things have been acquired by these programs and then
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 500.01 510.37 <NA> <unk> you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation like this one which is going to spread over <unk>
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 510.32 522.37 <NA> all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved and this process goes on and on and on 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 530.01 536.12 <NA> people had asked me really was do these guys have a biosignature 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 536.05 546.92 <NA> can we measure this type of life because if we can maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 546.73 554.58 <NA> so i said well <unk> perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 555.17 556.95 <NA> <unk> in fact it should perhaps make
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 556.75 564.11 <NA> use of the concepts that i developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 563.95 566.66 <NA> and the thing i came up with i have to first give you
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 566.66 574.98 <NA> an introduction about the idea and maybe that would be a meaning detector rather than a life detector <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 575.19 581.51 <NA> <unk> and the way we would do that i would like to find out how i can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 581.27 584.45 <NA> as opposed to text that is in our books and
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 584.27 595.36 <NA> i would like to do it in such a way that i don 't actually have to be able to read the language because i 'm sure i won 't be able to as long as i know that there 's some sort of alphabet so here would be a frequency <unk>
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 595.31 602.11 <NA> plot of how often you find each of the twenty six letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 604.9 612.11 <NA> <unk> roughly equally frequent <unk> but if you now look at the same distribution in english texts <unk> it looks like that <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 611.68 621.59 <NA> and i 'm telling you this is very robust across english texts <unk> and if i look at french texts it looks a little bit different or italian or german they all have their own type of
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 621.19 629.94 <NA> frequency distribution <unk> but it 's robust it doesn 't matter whether it writes about politics or about science <unk> it doesn 't matter whether it 's a
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 630.02 635.53 <NA> <unk> poem or whether it 's a mathematical text it 's a robust signature <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 635.53 642.51 <NA> and it 's very stable as long as our books are written in english because people are rewriting them and recopying them
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 642.11 651.31 <NA> it 's going to be there <unk> so that inspired me to think about well what if i try to use this idea in order not to detect
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 651.31 654.34 <NA> random texts from texts with meaning but rather
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 654.81 665.08 <NA> <unk> detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life <unk> but first i have to ask what are these building blocks like the alphabet elements that i showed you well <unk>
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 664.98 679.97 <NA> <unk> it turns out we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks we could use amino acids <unk> we could use nucleic acids carboxylic acids fatty acids in fact chemistry 's extremely rich and our body uses a lot of them so that we actually to test this
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 679.99 685.28 <NA> <unk> idea first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids and here 's the result 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 685.28 692.73 <NA> here is in fact <unk> what you get if you for example look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 692.56 704.91 <NA> or in interstellar space or in fact in a laboratory where you made very sure that in your primordial soup there is no living stuff in there what you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there 's some trace elements of
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 704.99 707.16 <NA> <unk> other ones that is
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 706.96 709.89 <NA> also very robust what you find
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 709.89 718.81 <NA> in systems like earth where there are amino acids <unk> but there is no life <unk> but suppose you take some dirt
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 718.47 719.47 <NA> and
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 719.26 724.96 <NA> dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers because there 's bacteria all over
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 725.31 733.69 <NA> <unk> you take water anywhere on earth because it 's teaming with life and you make the same analysis the spectrum looks completely different 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 733.26 744.46 <NA> of course there is still glycine and alanine but in fact there are these heavy elements these heavy amino acids <unk> that are being produced because they are valuable to the organism <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 744.54 751.75 <NA> and some other ones that are not used in the set of twenty they will not appear at all in any type of concentration <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 751.75 754.91 <NA> so this also turns out to be extremely robust it doesn 't

ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 769.38 779.97 <NA> now you could ask <unk> well <unk> what about these avidians the avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 780.07 790.38 <NA> so this is the distribution that you get if in fact there is no life <unk> they have about twenty eight of these instructions and if you have a system where they 're being replaced <unk>
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 790.33 798.51 <NA> one by the other it 's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 801.18 807.7 <NA> <unk> take a set of replicating guys like in the video that you saw <unk> it looks like this <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 807.69 820.54 <NA> so there are some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms and their frequency is going to be high and there 's actually some instructions that you only use once if ever <unk> so they are either poisonous or really
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 820.41 825.14 <NA> should be used at less of a level than random in this case

ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 916.84 928.08 <NA> i was being nasty i just turned up the heat again and again and of course it reaches the viability threshold and i 'm just showing this to you again because it 's so nice you hit the viability threshold the distribution changes to

ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1004.84 1006.47 <NA> <unk> first thing that we learn
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1006.3 1016.55 <NA> is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone without referring at all to the type of things that we hold <unk>
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1016.45 1022.23 <NA> <unk> dear as far as the type of life on earth is and that in a sense removes us again 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1025.01 1036.81 <NA> <unk> it 's this continuous dethroning of man of how we think we 're special because we 're alive <unk> well <unk> we can make life <unk> we can make life in the computer granted <unk> it 's limited <unk> but we have learned
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1036.81 1038.44 <NA> what it takes
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1037.99 1043.35 <NA> in order to actually construct it and once we have that <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1043.01 1049.95 <NA> then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say <unk> if we understand the fundamental processes
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1049.82 1054.94 <NA> that do not refer to any particular substrate then we can go
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1054.87 1061.72 <NA> <unk> out and try other worlds <unk> figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1061.56 1066.58 <NA> figure enough about the normal chemistry the geochemistry of the planet <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1066.58 1074.27 <NA> so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life <unk> and then look for large deviations from this this
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1074.03 1075.2 <NA> thing sticking
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1078.64 1083.59 <NA> <unk> now we don 't know that there 's life then <unk> but we could say well at least i 'm going to have to take a look
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1083.37 1091.31 <NA> very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from and that might be our chance of actually discovering life
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1091.14 1099.11 <NA> when we cannot visibly see it and so that 's really the only take home message that i have for you life
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1099.11 1104.97 <NA> can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1104.99 1114.36 <NA> <unk> planets <unk> and if we remove the mystery of life <unk> then i think it <unk> it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live <unk> 
ChristophAdami_2011X 1 ChristophAdami_2011X 1113.93 1120.43 <NA> and how perhaps we 're not as special as we always think we are <unk> and i 'm going to leave you with that and thank you very much
