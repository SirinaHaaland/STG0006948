RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 242.38 247.52 <NA> we traveled through five seas two oceans nine ports <unk> 
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 247.15 254.15 <NA> and i learned a lot about shipping and one of the first things that surprised me when i got on board kendal
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 253.93 254.94 <NA> was
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 255.07 265.02 <NA> where are all the people i have friends in the navy who tell me they sail with one thousand sailors at a time <unk> but on kendal there were only twenty one crew 
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 264.92 267.85 <NA> now that 's because shipping is very efficient <unk>
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 269.33 275.02 <NA> <unk> has made it very efficient ships have automation now they can operate with small
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 276.24 285.82 <NA> <unk> but it also means that in the words of a port chaplain i once met the average seafarer you 're going to find on a container ship is either tired or exhausted 
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 286.11 289.24 <NA> because the pace of modern shipping
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 288.87 298.36 <NA> is quite punishing for what the shipping calls its human element a strange phrase which they don 't seem to realize sounds a little bit inhuman 
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 298.5 304.97 <NA> so most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 305.2 313.73 <NA> they don 't have time to relax they 're at sea for months at a time and even when they 're on board they don 't have access to what a five year old would
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 313.3 320.33 <NA> take for granted the internet and another thing that surprised me when i got on board kendal was
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 320.33 327.68 <NA> who i was sitting next to not the queen i can 't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 327.31 329.97 <NA> but around that dining table in the officer

RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 345.38 354.55 <NA> because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last sixty years when most of the general public stopped noticing it was something called an open registry
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 355.14 362.35 <NA> <unk> a flag of convenience ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry 
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 362.55 370.18 <NA> you can get a flag from the landlocked nation of bolivia or mongolia or north korea though that 's not very popular

RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 438.45 440.77 <NA> and that 's because shipping
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 441.06 449.81 <NA> has very tight margins and they want cheap fuel so they use something called bunker fuel <unk> which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the

RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 453.64 462.9 <NA> and shipping is the greenest method of transport in terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile it emits about a thousandth of aviation
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 462.48 464.9 <NA> and about a tenth of trucking but
RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 464.5 467.9 <NA> it 's not benign because there 's so much of it

RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 506.16 516.47 <NA> <unk> i also traveled to cape cod to look at the plight of the north atlantic right whale because this to me was one of the most surprising things about

RoseGeorge_2013S 1 RoseGeorge_2013S 529.87 534.14 <NA> <unk> has a role to play here because shipping noise has
