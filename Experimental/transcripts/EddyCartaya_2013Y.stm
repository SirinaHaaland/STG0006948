EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 80.01 87.17 <NA> well those of you who have ever seen or touched snow you know that it 's really light because it 's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it 's mostly air 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 87.17 100.14 <NA> if you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball it gets really small hard and dense well on a mountain like hood where it snows over twenty feet a year <unk> it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 100.64 110.89 <NA> <unk> now each year more and more ice stacks up on top of it and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight <unk> forming a slow moving river of ice <unk> 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 110.84 118.98 <NA> <unk> when ice packed like that starts to move <unk> we call it a glacier and we give it a name the name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the sandy glacier <unk> 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 129.87 137.24 <NA> <unk> forming big networks of caves sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock now the crazy thing about glacier caves
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 137.06 147.58 <NA> is that each year <unk> new tunnels form different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave <unk> warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down <unk>
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 147.53 154.31 <NA> and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up gets into the cave and melts the ceilings back taller and taller
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 154.99 164.96 <NA> <unk> weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving because it 's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that 's slowly sliding down the mountain now
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 164.86 168.4 <NA> this is brent mcgregor <unk> my cave exploration partner <unk>

EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 187.92 199.72 <NA> so in july of that year <unk> we went out on the glacier and we found a big crack in the ice <unk> we had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole this is me looking into the entrance
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 200.76 207.38 <NA> <unk> at the end of this hole we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice <unk> 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 207.38 211.58 <NA> we followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 211.16 217 <NA> and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three dimensional map of the cave on our way back out 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 216.8 225.14 <NA> so how do you map a cave well cave maps aren 't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 225.14 229.55 <NA> to make a cave map you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 229.93 232.97 <NA> <unk> you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations then
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 232.96 240.23 <NA> you use a compass and and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings <unk> 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 239.74 249.96 <NA> now those of you taking trigonometry that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there in
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 250.22 256.35 <NA> <unk> the more i mapped and studied caves the more useful i found all that math that i originally hated in school to be 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 255.95 257.91 <NA> so when you 're done surveying 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 257.71 263.11 <NA> you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 262.93 266.36 <NA> and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this and
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 266.36 273.7 <NA> it 'll show you both a bird 's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage kind of like an ant farm view <unk> 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 273.52 278.82 <NA> we named this cave snow dragon cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow

EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 279.87 284.83 <NA> <unk> more snow melted off the glacier we found more caves and we realized they were all connected

EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 349.07 354.97 <NA> brent named this cave pure imagination i think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever

EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 435.2 443.44 <NA> even now brent and i find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard <unk> hidden away just waiting to be found 
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 443.28 454.97 <NA> like i said earlier the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now but that 's not true every year <unk> new caves get discovered that no one has ever been
EddyCartaya_2013Y 1 EddyCartaya_2013Y 454.93 464.57 <NA> <unk> in before so it 's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself you just have to be willing to look and go where people don 't often go
