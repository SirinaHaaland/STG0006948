HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 630.98 641.49 <NA> it 's a place where your data can be free so when we think about increasingly how governments want to access user data what they 're trying to do in iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 642.59 650.2 <NA> in my own field of investigative journalism we 're also having to start thinking globally so this is a site called investigative dashboard
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 650.82 655.21 <NA> <unk> if you 're trying to track a dictator 's assets for example hosni mubarak 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 654.98 665.41 <NA> you know he 's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he 's in trouble and what you want to do to investigate that is you need to have access to all of the world 's as many as you can 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 665.41 671.32 <NA> companies ' house registrations databases <unk> so this is a website that tries to

HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 687.18 692.63 <NA> the decisions which are impacting us the most perhaps the most important decisions
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 692.63 704.01 <NA> that are being made about war and so forth again we can 't just make a freedom of information request it 's really difficult <unk> so we 're still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information through leaks
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 705.74 712.98 <NA> <unk> so when the guardian did this investigation about the afghan war you know they can 't walk into the department of defense
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 712.58 722.47 <NA> and and ask for all the information you know they 're just not going to get it so this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by american soldiers
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 722.47 727.27 <NA> about the afghan war and leaked <unk> and then they 're able to do this investigation
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 729.9 731.62 <NA> <unk> rather large investigation

HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 746.4 749.62 <NA> through a leak from a disgruntled wikileaker
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 750.04 751.88 <NA> <unk> ended up going to work at the guardian <unk> 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 751.65 761.99 <NA> so i can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak it was amazing i mean it was amazing it reminded me of that scene in the wizard of oz do you know the one i mean where the <unk>
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 761.94 775.02 <NA> little dog toto runs across to where the wizard [ is ] and he pulls back the dog 's pulling back the curtain and don 't look behind the screen don 't look at the man behind the screen it was just like that because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 777.98 782.89 <NA> <unk> they were just like us <unk> they all bitched about each other i mean <unk> quite gossipy those cables 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 782.89 792.03 <NA> okay but i thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp these are human beings just like us they don 't have special powers they 're not magic they are not our parents
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 792.14 796.44 <NA> <unk> beyond that what i found most
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 796.46 804.97 <NA> fascinating was the level of endemic corruption that i saw across all different countries <unk> and particularly centered around the heart of power
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 805.16 814.87 <NA> around public officials who were embezzling the public 's money for their own personal enrichment and allowed to do that because of official secrecy <unk> 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 814.68 821.9 <NA> so i 've mentioned wikileaks <unk> because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 821.72 829.94 <NA> because that that is what julian assange did he wasn 't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal he threw it
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 829.95 833.13 <NA> all out there that did end up with
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 833.13 845.21 <NA> vulnerable people in afghanistan being exposed it also meant that the belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the u s government 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 846.31 854.97 <NA> is that radical openness i say it 's not because for me what it means it doesn 't mean abdicating power responsibility
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 855.13 862.11 <NA> accountability it 's actually being a partner with power <unk> it 's about sharing responsibility <unk> sharing accountability <unk> 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 861.77 871.23 <NA> also the fact that he threatened to sue me because i got a leak of his leaks i thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology to be honest as well 
HeatherBrooke_2012G 1 HeatherBrooke_2012G 872.51 879.97 <NA> laughs the other thing is that power is incredibly seductive and you must have two real qualities <unk> i think
