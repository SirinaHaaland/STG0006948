JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 31.88 39.22 <NA> <unk> he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in india a topic that indian elites love to ignore <unk> 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 39.22 49.99 <NA> so as part of this campaign he was using all of the traditional tactics that a good gandhian organizer would use so he was on a hunger strike and hazare realized through his hunger
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 49.78 54.85 <NA> that actually maybe this time in the 21st century a hunger strike wouldn 't be enough
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 54.99 57.4 <NA> <unk> so he started playing around with
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 56.94 59.32 <NA> mobile activism
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 58.83 61.99 <NA> so the first thing he did is he said to people okay 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 61.62 69.65 <NA> why don 't you send me a text message if you support my campaign against corruption so he does this he gives people a short code and
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 69.42 76.37 <NA> about eighty thousand people do it okay that 's pretty respectable but then he decides let me tweak my tactics a little bit
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 80.4 90.42 <NA> now for those of you who have lived in the global south you 'll know that missed calls are a really critical part of global mobile culture i see people nodding

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 112.19 125.14 <NA> so why do people leave missed calls well the reason of course is that they 're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts so when hazare asked people to leave him a missed call
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 127.29 131.83 <NA> <unk> a little guess how many people actually did this

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 320.98 325.2 <NA> new power is the deployment of mass participation
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 325.02 329.94 <NA> and peer coordination these are the two key elements to create change and shift outcomes
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 330.31 333.39 <NA> and we see new power all around us

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 371.31 379.61 <NA> old power is held like a currency <unk> new power works like a current old power is held by a few new power

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 392.08 397.61 <NA> so we 've talked a little bit about what new power is let 's for a second talk about what new power isn 't 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 397.3 400.14 <NA> new power is not your facebook page

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 418.52 429.7 <NA> new power is not inherently positive in fact this isn 't an normative argument that we 're making there are many good things about new power <unk> but it can produce bad outcomes more participation more peer
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 429.66 438.28 <NA> <unk> coordination sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things like things for example in the medical profession that we want new power to get nowhere near <unk> 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 437.88 448.22 <NA> and thirdly <unk> new power is not the inevitable victor <unk> in fact <unk> unsurprisingly as many of these new power models get to scale what you see is this massive pushback
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 448.17 454.97 <NA> <unk> from the forces of old power just look at this really interesting epic struggle going on right now between edward snowden

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 460.5 474.45 <NA> and so <unk> it 's not at all clear that new power will be the inevitable victor that said <unk> keep one thing in mind we 're at the beginning of a very steep curve <unk> so you think about some of these new power models right these were just like someone 's
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 474.45 479.7 <NA> garage idea a few years ago <unk> and now they 're disrupting entire industries
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 480.05 492.57 <NA> <unk> so what 's interesting about new power is the way it feeds on itself once you have an experience of new power <unk> you tend to expect and want more of it <unk> so let 's say you 've used a peer to peer lending platform like

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 549.09 554.55 <NA> in fact what 's interesting about new power is that it eschews some of the professionalization and

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 558.06 569.58 <NA> so what 's interesting about these new power values and these new power models is what they mean for organizations so we 've spent a bit of time thinking <unk> <unk> how can we plot organizations
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 569.09 579.85 <NA> on a two by two where essentially we look at new power values and new power models and see where different people sit we started with a u s analysis and let me show you some
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 579.78 582.62 <NA> <unk> interesting findings <unk> so the first is apple 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 582.41 587.5 <NA> in this framework we actually described apple as an old power company 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 587.5 599.96 <NA> that 's because the ideology the governing ideology of apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in cupertino it 's absolutely about that beautiful perfect thing descending
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 602.05 605.99 <NA> <unk> and it does not value as a company transparency in fact it 's very secretive 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 605.99 616.7 <NA> now apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world so this shows that you can still pursue a successful old power strategy but one can argue that there 's real vulnerabilites in that model 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 616.21 622.71 <NA> i think another interesting comparison is that of the obama campaign versus the obama presidency
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 631.16 633.33 <NA> <unk> i like president obama but he ran
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 633.13 642.84 <NA> with new power at his back right <unk> and he said to people we are the ones we 've been waiting for and he used crowdfunding to power a campaign 
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 642.84 649.24 <NA> but when he got into office he governed like more or less all the other presidents did and this is a really interesting
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 649.05 654.97 <NA> trend is when new power gets powerful what happens <unk> so this is a framework you should look at
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 654.96 664.85 <NA> <unk> and think about where your own organization sits on it and think about where it should be in five or ten years <unk> so what do you do if you 're old power well if you 're there thinking
JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 664.67 673.18 <NA> in old power this won 't happen to us then just look at the wikipedia entry for encyclopdia britannica

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 675.97 686.36 <NA> <unk> but if you are old power the most important thing you can do is to occupy yourself before others occupy you before you are occupied <unk> imagine that a group <unk>

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 764.23 774.99 <NA> now new power models live and die by the strength of their networks by whether the drivers and the consumers who use the service actually believe in it because they

JeremyHeimans_2014S 1 JeremyHeimans_2014S 819.27 824.9 <NA> will that old power just emerge so will new power elites just become old power and
