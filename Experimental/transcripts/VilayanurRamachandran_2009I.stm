VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 12.67 17.54 <NA> <unk> like to talk to you today about the human brain <unk> which is what we do research on at the university of california <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 17.08 24.09 <NA> just think about this problem for a second here is a lump of flesh about three pounds which you can hold in the palm of your hand <unk>

VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 34.17 41.46 <NA> and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world it 's the greatest mystery confronting human beings how does this all come about well 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 41.06 49.12 <NA> the brain as you know is made up of neurons we 're looking at neurons here there are one hundred billion neurons in the adult human brain 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 49.12 54.97 <NA> and each neuron makes something like one thousand to ten thousand contacts with other neurons in the brain <unk> and based on this
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 54.96 61.75 <NA> <unk> people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 61.55 71.86 <NA> so how do you go about studying the brain <unk> one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain and study changes in their behavior this is what i spoke about in the last ted today i 'll talk about <unk>
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 71.76 78.44 <NA> <unk> a different approach which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain <unk> and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 80.11 82.19 <NA> <unk> on the activity of nerve cells in the brain <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 82.72 90.45 <NA> now one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy in parma by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 90.45 96.11 <NA> is a group of neurons called mirror neurons which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 95.83 99.99 <NA> now it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 100 102.76 <NA> front of the brain <unk> which have been known for over fifty years 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 102.58 112.39 <NA> these neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action for example if i do that and reach and grab an apple a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 112.39 117.73 <NA> if i reach out and pull an object another neuron will fire <unk> commanding me to pull that object <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 117.28 120.54 <NA> these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 120.54 129.52 <NA> but what rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons <unk> maybe about twenty percent of them will also fire when i 'm looking at somebody else performing the same action so
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 130.08 141.09 <NA> <unk> that fires when i reach and grab something but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something <unk> and this is truly astonishing because it 's as though this neuron is adopting the other person 's point of view 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 141.09 147.13 <NA> it 's almost as though it 's performing a performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person 's action <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 146.67 154.97 <NA> now what is the significance of these mirror neurons for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation <unk> because to imitate a complex act
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 154.78 164.93 <NA> <unk> act requires my brain to adopt the other person 's point of view so this is important for imitation and emulation well why is that important well let 's take a look at the next slide <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 165.25 174.93 <NA> so <unk> how do you do imitation why is imitation important mirror neurons and imitation emulation <unk> now let 's look at culture the phenomenon of human culture if you
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 177.2 187.41 <NA> <unk> one hundred thousand years ago <unk> let 's look at human evolution it turns out that something very important happened around <unk> seventy five thousand years ago <unk> and that is there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number <unk>
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 187.31 197.58 <NA> <unk> of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use the use of fire the use of shelters and of course language and the ability to read somebody else 's mind and interpret that person 's behavior <unk>
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 197.53 204.94 <NA> all of that happened relatively quickly even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 204.95 209.62 <NA> hundred thousand years ago all of this happened very very quickly and i claim that what happened was
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 209.13 217.48 <NA> the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people 's actions so that when there was a sudden
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 217.23 224.81 <NA> accidental discovery by one member of the group say the use of fire <unk> or a particular type of tool instead of dying out this spread
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 227.35 233.63 <NA> <unk> or was transmitted vertically <unk> down the generations so this made evolution suddenly lamarckian instead of darwinian
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 233.63 245.16 <NA> darwinian evolution is slow it takes hundreds of thousands of years a polar bear to evolve a coat will take thousands of generations <unk> maybe one hundred thousand years a human being a child can just watch its parent
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 244.92 246.32 <NA> kill
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 246.04 254.97 <NA> another polar bear <unk> and skin it and put the skin on its body fur on the body <unk> and learn it in one step what the polar bear took one hundred thousand years to learn
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 255.07 258.01 <NA> it can learn in five minutes <unk> maybe ten minutes
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 258.01 268.5 <NA> <unk> and then once it 's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population <unk> this is the basis the imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 268.64 274.81 <NA> now there is another kind of mirror neuron which is involved in something quite different and that is there are mirror
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 275.1 284.3 <NA> <unk> just as there are mirror neurons for action there are mirror neurons for touch in other words if somebody touches me my hand neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 284.06 289.36 <NA> but the same neuron in some cases will fire when i simply watch another person being touched 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 289.36 300.02 <NA> so it 's empathizing the other person being touched <unk> so most of them will fire when i 'm touched in different locations different neurons for different locations <unk> but a subset of them will fire even when i watch somebody else being touched in the
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 301.9 312.38 <NA> <unk> here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy now the question then arises <unk> if i simply watch another person being touched <unk> why do i not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 312.16 325.02 <NA> merely by watching somebody being touched i mean i empathize with that person but i don 't literally feel the touch <unk> well that 's because you 've got receptors in your skin touch and pain receptors going back into your brain and saying don 't worry you 're not being touched <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 326.06 327.76 <NA> <unk> by all means with the other person 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 327.55 338.53 <NA> but do not actually experience the touch otherwise you 'll get confused and muddled okay so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 338.32 348.69 <NA> but if you remove the arm <unk> you simply anesthetize my arm so you put an injection into my arm anesthetize the brachial plexus <unk> so the arm is numb and there is no sensations coming in if i now watch <unk>
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2009I 348.59 354.94 <NA> <unk> you being touched i literally feel it in my hand in other words <unk> you have dissolved the barrier between you and other
