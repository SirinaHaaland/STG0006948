RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 23.07 29.94 <NA> and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process a recursive process <unk> so he starts out with one line
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 29.93 32.4 <NA> <unk> then two and then four and then sixteen and so on <unk> 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 32.12 40.89 <NA> and if he does this an infinite number of times which you can do in mathematics <unk> he ends up with an infinite number of lines each of which has an infinite number of points in it 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 40.55 50.02 <NA> so he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity <unk> and this blew his mind literally he checked into a sanitarium and when he came out of
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 51.75 60.22 <NA> <unk> he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself he was a very religious man he
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 59.76 62.14 <NA> was a mathematician on a mission <unk> 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 61.89 70.15 <NA> and other mathematicians did the same sort of thing a swedish mathematician von koch decided that instead of subtracting lines he would add them 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 70.15 76.81 <NA> and so he came up with this beautiful curve <unk> and there 's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape we can use any
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 76.44 79.73 <NA> any seed shape we like and

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 84.67 96.59 <NA> now upon iteration that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure <unk> so these all have the property of self similarity the part looks like the whole it 's the same pattern at many different scales <unk> 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 96.59 104.97 <NA> now mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down you measure a longer and longer length and since they went
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 104.9 110.46 <NA> <unk> through the iterations an infinite number of times as the ruler shrinks down to infinity <unk> the length
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 110.23 112.17 <NA> goes to infinity 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 112.31 119.52 <NA> this made no sense at all so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books they said these are pathological curves and we don 't have to discuss them 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 120.98 125.05 <NA> and that worked for a hundred years <unk> and then in
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 129.84 136.39 <NA> <unk> realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals <unk> you get the shapes of nature <unk>

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 154.99 162.8 <NA> <unk> is covered with fractals the mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes they were breathing those words with fractal lungs it 's very ironic
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 162.7 170.07 <NA> and i 'll show you a little natural recursion here again we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape <unk>
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 170.07 173.37 <NA> <unk> so here 's the second iteration and the third fourth

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 180.53 186.9 <NA> <unk> i happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an african village <unk> you see fractals <unk> 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 186.47 194.32 <NA> and i thought this is fabulous i wonder why and of course i had to go to africa and ask folks why <unk> so i got a fulbright
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 194.14 200.05 <NA> scholarship to to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 199.81 204.91 <NA> which is a great job if you can get it and so i finally got to

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 293.75 300.02 <NA> now you might wonder how can people fit in a tiny village only this big that 's because they 're spirit people it 's the ancestors
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 300.31 302.23 <NA> <unk> and of course the spirit people
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 302.23 314.93 <NA> have a little miniature village in their village right <unk> so it 's just like georg cantor said <unk> the recursion continues forever this is in the mandara mountains near the nigerian border in cameroon mokoulek <unk> i saw this diagram drawn by a french
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 314.89 324.84 <NA> architect and i thought wow what a beautiful fractal so i tried to come up with a seed shape which upon iteration would unfold into this thing i came up with this structure

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 351.96 362.29 <NA> <unk> we can take you there but you can 't go inside because that 's the sacred altar where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility <unk>
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 362.24 372.43 <NA> were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this and the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales so here 's a nankani village in mali <unk>
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 372.38 379.7 <NA> and you can see you go inside the family enclosure you go inside and here 's pots in the fireplace stacked recursively here 's

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 405.22 415.29 <NA> indigenous architecture <unk> and that was actually my original hypothesis when i first saw those african fractals i thought wow <unk> so any indigenous group that doesn 't have a state society that sort of hierarchy <unk> must <unk>
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 415.19 421.18 <NA> <unk> have a kind of bottom up architecture but that turns out not to be true i started collecting aerial photographs of
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 430.05 432.7 <NA> <unk> that they use <unk> so native americans
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 432.5 436.6 <NA> use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 436.2 449.87 <NA> you can see on the pottery and the baskets here 's an aerial photograph of one of the anasazi ruins you can see it 's circular at the largest scale <unk> but it 's rectangular at the smaller scale right it is not the same pattern at two different scales <unk>
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 453.64 456.11 <NA> <unk> you ignoring the diversity of african cultures

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 477.74 485.19 <NA> <unk> so they 're similar to themselves but they 're not necessarily similar to each other you see very different uses for fractals it 's a shared technology in africa 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 485.84 497.07 <NA> and finally <unk> well isn 't this just intuition it 's not really mathematical knowledge africans can 't possibly really be using fractal geometry right it wasn 't invented until the 1970s 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 497.07 499.83 <NA> well it 's true that some african fractals

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 585.6 600.02 <NA> this windscreen <unk> and of course fences around the world are all cartesian all strictly linear <unk> but here in africa <unk> you 've got these nonlinear scaling fences <unk> so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things this guy in in mali just outside of bamako
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 601.18 610.59 <NA> <unk> you 're making fractal fences because nobody else is and his answer was very interesting <unk> he said well if i lived in the jungle i would only use the long rows of straw
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 610.38 614.27 <NA> because they 're very quick and they 're very cheap it doesn 't take much time doesn 't take much straw

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 655.04 664.33 <NA> to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry it was in a symbolic code and this was bamana sand divination and the same divination system is found all over africa
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 664.59 672.61 <NA> you can find it on the east coast as well as well as the west coast and often the the symbols are very well preserved so

RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 705.01 710.06 <NA> matter and finally out of desperation i said well <unk> let me explain georg cantor in one thousand eight hundred and seventy seven 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 710.07 716.79 <NA> and i started explaining why i was there in in africa and they got very excited when they saw the cantor set 
RonEglash_2007G 1 RonEglash_2007G 716.45 724.84 <NA> and one of them said come here i think i can help you out here and so he took me through the initiation ritual for for a bamana priest
