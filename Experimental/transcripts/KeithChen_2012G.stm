KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 41.99 50.38 <NA> what i 'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i 've been working on
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 50.2 54.18 <NA> about the link between the structure of the language you speak

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 55.04 56.71 <NA> you find yourself

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 58.83 64.81 <NA> let me tell you a little bit about savings rates a little bit about language and then i 'll draw that connection
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 64.65 72.31 <NA> <unk> let 's start by thinking about the member countries of the oecd or the organization of economic cooperation and development 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 73.17 74.93 <NA> oecd countries 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 75 79.17 <NA> by and large you should think about these as the richest most industrialized countries in the world <unk>

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 86.17 96.83 <NA> despite all of these similarities we see huge differences in savings behavior so all the way over on the left of this graph what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter <unk>
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 96.73 102.8 <NA> <unk> of their gdp every year <unk> and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year <unk> 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 105.25 107.73 <NA> all the way on the other side is greece <unk> 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 107.57 117.15 <NA> and what you can see is that over the last twenty five years greece has barely managed to save more than ten percent of their gdp it should be noted of course that
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 116.69 124.96 <NA> the united states and the u k are the next in line <unk> now that we see these huge differences in savings rates how is it
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 125 136.78 <NA> possible that language might have something to do with these differences <unk> let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ linguists and cognitive scientists have been have been exploring this question for for many years now <unk> 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 136.78 140.32 <NA> and then i 'll draw the connection between these two behaviors 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 140.91 144.28 <NA> many of you have probably already noticed that i 'm chinese 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 143.97 154.3 <NA> i grew up in the midwest of the united states and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and in fact 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 154.81 163.23 <NA> <unk> fundamentally than that ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways now how might that be let me give you an example <unk> suppose i were

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 184.52 198.07 <NA> my language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother 's side or my father 's side whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth and if this man was my father 's brother whether he was older than or younger than my father 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 198.07 200.29 <NA> all of this information is obligatory
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 200.37 207.55 <NA> <unk> chinese doesn 't let me ignore it and in fact if i want to speak correctly chinese forces me to constantly think about it <unk>

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 208.98 220.03 <NA> that fascinated me endlessly as a child <unk> but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 219.78 225.11 <NA> so for example <unk> if i 'm speaking in english i have to speak grammatically differently if i 'm talking about
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 228.07 238.37 <NA> <unk> it is raining now or future rain it will rain tomorrow notice that english requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events <unk> why <unk> because i have to consider <unk>
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 238.27 247.52 <NA> <unk> that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say it will rain or it 's going to rain it 's simply not permissible in english to say it rain tomorrow

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 256.42 261.11 <NA> they can say yesterday it rain now it rain tomorrow it rain 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 261.12 269.01 <NA> in some deep sense chinese doesn 't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 271.13 279.97 <NA> is this difference in languages only between very very distantly related languages like english and chinese actually no so many of you know in this room that

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 291.92 300.17 <NA> feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying morgen regnet es quite literally to an english ear it rain tomorrow

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 313.75 327.27 <NA> you speak english a futured language and what that means is that every time you discuss the future or any kind of a future event grammatically you 're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it 's something viscerally different 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 327.27 329.88 <NA> now suppose that that visceral difference
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 329.99 334.03 <NA> <unk> makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 334.03 341.67 <NA> if that 's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present that 's going to make it harder to save <unk> 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 341.33 349.96 <NA> if on the other hand you speak a futureless language the present and the future you speak about them identically <unk> if that subtly nudges you to feel about

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 386.59 392.18 <NA> just to give you a hint of that let 's look back at that oecd graph that we were talking about 
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 391.87 400.05 <NA> what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak
KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 400 401.37 <NA> futured languages

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 425.04 434.87 <NA> <unk> all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists and i 'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences <unk> hoping to get this relationship to break

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 441.69 449.92 <NA> one way to imagine that is i gather large datasets from around the world so for example <unk> there is the survey of health [ aging ] and retirement in europe

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 508.99 516.62 <NA> combine that with a world value survey which measures the political opinions and fortunately for me the savings behaviors of

KeithChen_2012G 1 KeithChen_2012G 580.02 591.67 <NA> effectively everything i 'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families it 's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels
