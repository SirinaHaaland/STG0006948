RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 12.91 14.99 <NA> <unk> let me share with you today
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 14.99 24.63 <NA> an original discovery <unk> but i want to tell it to you the way it really happened not the way i present it in a scientific meeting or the way you 'd read it in a scientific paper
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 25.49 30.69 <NA> <unk> story about beyond biomimetics to something i 'm calling biomutualism 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 30.71 41.73 <NA> i define that as an association between biology and another discipline where each discipline reciprocally advances the other but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 41.81 50.13 <NA> now in terms of biomimetics as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature nature becomes a much more useful teacher <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 50.31 62.14 <NA> <unk> engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they 're advantageous <unk> but then integrating that with the best human engineering ultimately to make something actually better than nature now
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 62.88 74.84 <NA> being a biologist i was very curious about this these are gecko toes <unk> and we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly we discovered it <unk> and what we found was
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 76.3 79.37 <NA> <unk> structures on their toes with millions of tiny hairs
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 79.2 90.6 <NA> that look like a rug and each of those hairs has the worst case of split ends possible about one hundred to one thousand split ends that are nano size and the individual has two billion of these nano size split ends 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 90.6 97.79 <NA> they don 't stick by velcro or suction or glue they actually stick by intermolecular forces alone van der waals forces 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 97.81 104.91 <NA> and i 'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self cleaning dry adhesive has been made
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 104.92 113.55 <NA> from the simplest version in nature one branch my engineering collaborator ron fearing at berkeley had made the first synthetic version 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 113.24 122.71 <NA> and so has my other incredible collaborator mark cutkosky at stanford he made much larger hairs than the gecko <unk> but used the same general principles 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 122.71 124.48 <NA> and here is its first test
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 125.82 133.34 <NA> <unk> 's kellar autumn my former ph d student professor now at lewis and clark literally giving his first born child up for this test
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 154.95 159.98 <NA> <unk> 60 foot ascent <unk> lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of hollywood
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 159.81 166.31 <NA> and science man so you 're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko lynn verinsky ha wow 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 166.27 168.95 <NA> and what a privilege that has been robert full 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 170.5 178.77 <NA> that 's what she did on rough surfaces but she actually used these on smooth surfaces two of them to climb up and pull herself up and you can try this in the
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 180.02 182.52 <NA> <unk> the gecko inspired material
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 182.54 188.79 <NA> <unk> now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can 't get unstuck with the material <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 188.3 198.96 <NA> this is the gecko 's solution they actually peel their toes away from the surface at high rates as they run up the wall <unk> well i 'm really excited today to show you
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 198.5 200.08 <NA> the newest version
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 211.89 212.9 <NA> <unk> here is what it does
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 242.5 245.42 <NA> <unk> able to do in designing this incredible robot oh 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 248.8 249.96 <NA> one thing i want to
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 250 251.79 <NA> point out is look at stickybot 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 251.63 261 <NA> you see something on it it 's not just to look like a gecko <unk> it has a tail and just when you think you 've figured out nature this kind of thing happens 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 260.51 266.58 <NA> the engineers told us for the climbing robots that if they don 't have a tail <unk> they fall off the wall 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 266.27 270.57 <NA> so what they did was they asked us an important question 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 271.04 279.85 <NA> they said well it kind of looks like a tail even though we put a passive bar there do animals use their tails when they climb up walls
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 279.96 287.41 <NA> what they were doing was returning the favor by giving us a hypothesis to test in biology that we wouldn 't have thought of 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 287.37 301.31 <NA> so of course in reality we were then panicked being the biologists and we should know this already <unk> we said well what do tails do well we know that tails store fat for example <unk> we know that you can grab onto things with them 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 301.31 304.97 <NA> and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 304.96 311.51 <NA> <unk> balance it can also act as a counterbalance so watch this kangaroo 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 312.7 315.29 <NA> see that tail that 's incredible <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 314.92 318.68 <NA> marc raibert built a uniroo hopping robot <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 318.68 322.31 <NA> and it was unstable without its tail <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 324.76 329.88 <NA> now mostly tails limit maneuverability like this human inside this dinosaur suit
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 331.67 336.03 <NA> my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 335.57 338.94 <NA> by increasing the moment of inertia of a student <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 338.94 345.84 <NA> so they had a tail and running them through and obstacle course and found a decrement in performance like you 'd predict 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 347.54 354.43 <NA> but of course <unk> this is a passive tail and you can also have active tails and when i went back to research
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 355.23 364.55 <NA> <unk> that one of the great ted moments in the past from nathan we 've talked about an active tail video myhrvold thinks tail cracking dinosaurs were interested in love 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 364.55 365.89 <NA> not war robert full
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 367.41 373.63 <NA> he talked about the tail being a whip for communication <unk> it can also be used in defense <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 376.66 379.88 <NA> <unk> so we then went back and looked at the animal <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 379.42 391.31 <NA> and we ran it up a surface but this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there and watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips this is slowed down ten times <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 391.3 396.83 <NA> so here is normal speed <unk> and watch it now slip <unk> and see what it does with its tail 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 400 408.51 <NA> <unk> has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg and it contributes to stability <unk> if you make it slip a huge amount <unk> this is what we discovered
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 410.6 416.07 <NA> <unk> this is incredible <unk> the engineers had a really good idea <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 415.79 424.96 <NA> and then of course we wondered <unk> okay they have an active tail but let 's picture them they 're climbing up a wall <unk> or a tree and they get to the top and let 's say there 's
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 425 432.31 <NA> some leaves there and what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf and there was some wind or we shook it 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 432.03 435.4 <NA> and we did that experiment that you see here and
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 435.42 441.7 <NA> this is what we discovered now that 's real time you can 't see anything but there it is slowed down 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 443.16 450.17 <NA> what we discovered was the world 's fastest air righting response for those of you who remember your physics that 's a zero angular momentum righting response
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 451.75 458.57 <NA> <unk> cats falling cats do this they twist their bodies <unk> but geckos do it better and they do it with their tail <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 458.47 466.01 <NA> so they do it with this active tail as they swing around and then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 467.53 475.11 <NA> okay now we wondered if we were right we should be able to test this in a physical model in a robot <unk> so for ted we actually built a robot
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 475.4 484.23 <NA> <unk> over there a prototype with the tail and we 're going to attempt the first air righting response in a tail <unk> with a robot if we could have the lights on it 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 484.13 485.64 <NA> okay <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 485.81 489.03 <NA> there it goes <unk> and
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 489.02 490.95 <NA> show the video 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 494.03 500.17 <NA> there it is and it works just like it does in the animal <unk> so all you need is a swing
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 505.56 512.71 <NA> <unk> of course we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations so we thought oh that 's okay we 'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel we
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 512.71 520.27 <NA> 'll blow the air up we 'll give it a landing target a tree trunk just outside the plexi glass enclosure <unk> and see what it does 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 521.1 524.93 <NA> so we did and here is what it does so the wind is coming from the
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 525.16 527.09 <NA> <unk> slowed down ten times 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 528.31 531.56 <NA> it does an equilibrium glide <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 531.16 537.86 <NA> highly controlled this is sort of incredible <unk> but actually it 's quite beautiful when you take a picture of
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 538.51 549.75 <NA> and it 's better than that it just in the slide maneuvers in mid air and the way it does it is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left and it swings its other way to yaw right <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 549.75 551.91 <NA> so we can maneuver this way 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 551.67 554.97 <NA> and then we had to film this several times to believe this
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 555.23 562.93 <NA> it also does this watch this it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin <unk> it can actually swim through the air <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 562.93 566.07 <NA> but watch its front legs can you see what they are doing 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 567.68 571.35 <NA> what does that mean for the origin of flapping flight 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 571.04 576.24 <NA> maybe it 's evolved from coming down from trees and trying to control a glide 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 576.02 577.39 <NA> stay tuned for that
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 580.35 585.79 <NA> <unk> so then we wondered can they actually maneuver with this so there is the landing target could they steer towards it
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 585.36 589.45 <NA> with these capabilities here it is in the wind tunnel and it
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 589.45 594.7 <NA> certainly looks like it you can see it even better from down on top watch the animal <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 595.89 599.96 <NA> definitely moving towards the landing target watch the whip of its tail as it does
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 609.16 615.41 <NA> <unk> we have to go to the field <unk> and see if it actually does this completely opposite of the way you 'd see it on a nature film of course <unk>
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 615.1 620.24 <NA> we wondered do they actually glide in nature well we went to the forests of singapore and southeast asia <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 620.24 627.24 <NA> and the next video you see is the first time we 've showed this this is the actual video not staged a real research video of animal gliding down <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 627 629.76 <NA> there is a red trajectory line look at the end to see the animal
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 629.93 634.65 <NA> <unk> but then as it gets closer to the tree look at the close up and see if you can see it land <unk> 
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 635.57 643.95 <NA> so there it comes down there is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line you see it there there watch it come down now watch up there and you can see the landing did you see it hit it
RobertFull_2009 1 RobertFull_2009 643.49 647.74 <NA> actually uses its tail too just like we saw in the lab
