ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 17.92 23 <NA> many of you follow but we also follow for related reasons 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 23.29 28.65 <NA> obviously being a technology magazine technology trends are are something that we write about
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 30.05 31.89 <NA> but also it
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 31.58 46.2 <NA> 's part of being any monthly magazine you live in the future and we have a long lead time we have to plan issues many months in advance we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months nine months down the road so we 're in the forecasting business
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 46.22 50.08 <NA> <unk> we also like a lot of companies create a product that 's based on technology trends
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 50 51.88 <NA> <unk> this case ours is about
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 51.63 58.06 <NA> ideas and information and if we 're lucky some entertainment <unk> but the concept 's quite the same 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 58.35 66.62 <NA> and so we have to understand not only why tech 's important where it 's going <unk> but also very importantly when
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 66.4 73.12 <NA> the timing is is everything and it 's interesting when you look at the predictions made
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 72.78 74.48 <NA> during the peak of the boom in the
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 80.47 84.95 <NA> <unk> or internet advertising they were all right
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 84.64 86.9 <NA> they were just wrong in time 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 86.74 95.6 <NA> almost every one of those has come true just a few years later <unk> but the difference of a few years on on stock market valuations is obviously extreme <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 95.32 104.97 <NA> and that 's why timing is everything you 've probably seen something like this before this is the classic gartner hype curve which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 104.99 113.82 <NA> <unk> 's lifespan and just for fun we put a bunch of technologies on it to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak or whether they were about to crash into
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 113.82 116.17 <NA> the the trough of disillusionment 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 115.96 117 <NA> or
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 116.57 125.23 <NA> rise back in the slope of enlightenment etc and this is one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 125.73 135.13 <NA> <unk> and then anticipate the next upturn we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important we 'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first we
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 135.13 138.85 <NA> want to be the first to do it for the geeks who appreciate that we 'll catch it right there at the <unk>
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 141.65 147.63 <NA> we put linux on the cover <unk> but then it comes back and sufficiently big technologies
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 147.63 154.97 <NA> are going to hit the mainstream and they 're going to burst out and then it 's time to do it again last year <unk> and that
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 154.93 158.54 <NA> <unk> 's one way that we we try to time technology trends <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 158.35 167.06 <NA> i 'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but it 's
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 166.78 175.14 <NA> closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future <unk> it 's based 's based on the presumption the observation even
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 175.76 184.32 <NA> <unk> all important technologies go through four stages in their life at least one of one of the four stages <unk> sometimes all four of the stages <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 184.22 188.28 <NA> and at each one of these stages can be seen as a collision
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 188.12 190.68 <NA> a collision with
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 190.31 200.07 <NA> something else for example a critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world it 's an inflection point
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 200.91 208.42 <NA> <unk> and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be and maybe how you
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 208.26 217.63 <NA> can do something about it the first is the critical price the first stage in a technology 's advance is that it 'll fall below a critical price <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 218.04 224.48 <NA> after it falls below a critical price <unk> it will tend if it 's successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 232.66 234.53 <NA> <unk> and that 's another important point <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 235.33 247.97 <NA> and then finally <unk> a lot of technologies commoditize <unk> towards the end of their life they become nearly free each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it it 's an opportunity for the technology to change and even if you missed <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 247.97 249.15 <NA> you know the first
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 254.9 262.58 <NA> <unk> but hasn 't done displacement yet and hasn 't done free yet there 's still more opportunity in that i 'd like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 262.58 268.86 <NA> story of the dvd <unk> which is a technology which has done all of these the dvd as you know was introduced in the <unk>
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 269.83 278.8 <NA> and it was quite expensive <unk> but you can see that by one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight it had fallen below four hundred dollars and four hundred dollars was a psychological threshold
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 279.93 288.04 <NA> <unk> it started to take off and you can see that the the units started to trend up the hidden inflection point it was taking off 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 289.83 292.78 <NA> the next thing it hit a year later 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 292.29 297.82 <NA> was critical mass in this case <unk> twenty percent is often a good proxy for critical mass
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 297.72 304.04 <NA> in a household and what 's interesting here is that something else took off along with it
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 305.47 309.5 <NA> suddenly you have a dvd in the house you 've got high quality digital
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 309.3 315.71 <NA> video you have a reason to have a big screen television you have a reason for dolby five point one surround sound 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 315.22 324.93 <NA> and maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them <unk> and bring the rest of your entertainment in what 's interesting also is note that netflix was founded in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine reed hastings
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 326.09 331.41 <NA> <unk> he clearly saw that that was a moment that was an inflection point that he could do something with 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 332.42 339.03 <NA> the next phase it hit was displacement <unk> you can see around see around two thousand and one it finally out sold the vcr <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 338.9 340.83 <NA> and here too <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 341.03 349.99 <NA> you can see the implications in the world at large netflix was right the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 351.84 356.26 <NA> <unk> among the dvd 's many assets is that it 's very small you can stick it in the mailer
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 356.13 364.84 <NA> and post it cheaply <unk> that gave an advantage that was an implication of the technology 's rise that wasn 't obvious to everybody <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 365.1 371.96 <NA> and then finally <unk> dvds are approaching free <unk> there 's a company called apex a no name chinese firm who
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 371.77 374.84 <NA> has <unk> several times in the past year been the number one
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 392.56 399.84 <NA> <unk> but they 're getting very very cheap and look at the interesting implication of it as they get cheaper <unk> the premium brands the sonys and
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 402.65 410.13 <NA> <unk> are gaining them they 're being commodified <unk> and that 's what happens when things go to zero <unk> it 's a tough market out there 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 412.58 417.97 <NA> now they 've introduced these four these four ways of looking at technology these four stages of technology 's life i
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 417.97 427.69 <NA> 'd like to talk about some other technologies out there just technologies on our radar and i 'll use this lens these four as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 429.95 434.95 <NA> top 10 technologies out there they 're just examples of technologies that are in each each one of these
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 434.94 442.87 <NA> periods <unk> but i think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers these intersections are interesting to think about start with
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 442.38 451.34 <NA> gene sequencing as you probably know <unk> gene sequencing in a large part because it 's built on computers is falling in price at a kind of a moore 's
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 455.2 459.21 <NA> if craig venter indeed comes today he may tell you something about this
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 459.03 468.08 <NA> to sequence the human genome for forty million dollars by the end of this year that 's as opposed to to billions just a few years ago <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 468.67 471.47 <NA> you know <unk> our ability to
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 471.46 479.58 <NA> to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer what 's interesting is that at the same time the number of genes that we 're discovering
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 479.75 489.66 <NA> <unk> rising very quickly each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done very cheaply
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 489.38 491.46 <NA> <unk> if you want to know
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 491.24 494.07 <NA> <unk> you can learn about your own mosaic 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 494.45 497.53 <NA> here 's another technology that that 's approaching
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 497.32 500.08 <NA> a critical price this is a fascinating research
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 505.02 507.73 <NA> <unk> drug compounds and cocktails

ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 528.34 532.79 <NA> <unk> what 's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity if you look at the
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 532.39 540.44 <NA> correlation between these two as the anti retrovirals come down the number of people you can treat goes radically up <unk> and
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 540.01 543.17 <NA> the clinton foundation and who
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 542.95 549.8 <NA> believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by two thousand and five two million in sub saharan africa <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 549.46 552.68 <NA> and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 552.82 554.94 <NA> linux is another good example
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 555.01 563.7 <NA> now we 've switched to critical mass these are now technologies that are hitting critical mass <unk> if you look here here 's linux in red <unk> and it 's hit twenty percent <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 564.26 571.53 <NA> interestingly it 's done a crossover before but not the crossovers that matter the crossover that 's going to matter is the one with the blue <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 571.43 575.02 <NA> but you can look and see the direction those lines are going you can see that at the twenty
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 575.82 578.32 <NA> <unk> now taken seriously it 's not just for
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 577.92 585.55 <NA> for the geeks any more that is i imagine what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 586.89 599.74 <NA> another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars i don 't know whether anybody has a prius two thousand and four but they 're fantastic <unk> and if you look at the trends here by about two thousand and eight and i don 't think this is a crazy forecast
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 599.55 604.82 <NA> they 'll be two percent of auto sales two percent isn 't twenty percent but in the car
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 604.75 608.07 <NA> <unk> business which is slow moving that 's huge
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 609.27 616.29 <NA> that 's arrival at two percent you start seeing them on the roads everywhere <unk> and what 's interesting about
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 616.05 628.74 <NA> about the hybrids taking off is you 've now introduced electric motors to to the automobile industry it 's the first radical change <unk> in automobile technology in one hundred years and once you have electric motors you can do anything <unk> 
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 628.74 629.97 <NA> you can change the structure
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 630.05 636.87 <NA> <unk> of the car in any way you want <unk> you can have regenerative braking you can have drive by wire you can have replaceable body shapes
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 636.64 641.91 <NA> it 's a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car

ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 725 729.19 <NA> <unk> is probably the most interesting thing and here you have
ChrisAnderson_2004 1 ChrisAnderson_2004 728.73 738.25 <NA> just the number of songs that can be stored on on a hard drive you know there could be a film 's [ unclear ] there but it 's basically every song ever made
