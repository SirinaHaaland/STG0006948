GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 28.73 29.76 <NA> through a microscope
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 30.05 35.43 <NA> and i 'm going to show you some of this today <unk> so let 's start off looking at something rather
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 35.03 43.5 <NA> not so small something that we can see with our naked eye <unk> and that 's a bee <unk> so when you look at this bee it 's about this size here it 's about a centimeter <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 43.34 49.96 <NA> but to really see the details of the bee and really appreciate what it is you have to look a little bit closer <unk> so

GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 93.9 97.35 <NA> when i first saw living cells in a microscope i was absolutely
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 97.19 104.97 <NA> enthralled and amazed at what they looked like <unk> so if you look at the cell like that from the immune system they 're actually moving all over the place
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 104.98 106.92 <NA> this cell is looking for

GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 154.78 158.75 <NA> <unk> happens when we learn <unk> as you go farther down this scale here
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 158.53 170.22 <NA> that 's a micron or a micrometer and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom now an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom

GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 215.25 221.24 <NA> so if you look at this flower here and you 're a little bug if you 're on that surface of that of that flower 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 221.24 229.88 <NA> that 's what the terrain would look like the petal of that flower looks like that so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects and if you look a little bit closer at this

GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 314.24 319.52 <NA> plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 321.13 329.82 <NA> i want to talk about something really ordinary just ordinary sand i became interested in sand about ten years ago when i first saw sand from maui
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 330.05 333.25 <NA> and in fact this is a little bit of sand from maui <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 333.04 343.27 <NA> so sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size <unk> but when you look closer at this look at what 's there it 's really quite amazing <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 343.22 350.02 <NA> <unk> you have microshells there <unk> you have things like coral <unk> you have fragments of other shells you have

GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 355.98 360.5 <NA> an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 360.5 366.5 <NA> and the reason that is is because in a place like this island a lot of the sand is made of biological material because
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 366.34 371.03 <NA> the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 370.85 379.49 <NA> macroscopic animals grow <unk> and when they die their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand <unk> things like coral and so forth
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 380.26 383.48 <NA> <unk> so here 's for example a picture of sand from

GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 385.99 396.47 <NA> and when we 're walking along a beach we 're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history we don 't realize it but it 's actually a record of that entire ecology <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 396.37 402.59 <NA> so here we see for example a sponge spicule two bits of coral here 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 402.52 404.49 <NA> that 's a sea urchin spine
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 404.87 415.95 <NA> <unk> really some amazing stuff <unk> so when i first looked at this i was i thought gee this is like a little treasure trove here i couldn 't believe it and i 'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 415.46 420.6 <NA> here 's what most of the sand in our world looks like these are quartz crystals
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 420.14 429.97 <NA> and feldspar <unk> so most sand in the world on on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar it 's the erosion of granite rock so mountains are built up
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 429.84 432.19 <NA> <unk> up and they erode away by water
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 431.99 442.15 <NA> and rain and ice and so forth <unk> and they become grains of sand there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful these are sand from near the great lakes and you can see that it 's filled with minerals <unk>
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 442.05 452.77 <NA> <unk> like pink garnet and green epidote all kinds of amazing stuff and if you look at different sands from different places <unk> every single beach every single place you look at sand <unk> it 's different 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 455.08 462.77 <NA> <unk> like they 're little jewels there are places in africa where they do the mining of jewels and you go to the sand where where the rivers
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 462.67 468.44 <NA> have the sand go down to the ocean and it 's like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 468.31 476.38 <NA> so every grain of sand is unique every beach is different <unk> every single grain is different there are no two grains of sand alike in the world 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 476.38 479.85 <NA> every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 480.07 482.61 <NA> they 're like a snapshot in time 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 483.35 492.18 <NA> now sand is not only on earth but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe in fact outer space is filled with sand <unk>

GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 509.93 512.8 <NA> that we live in the planets and the moon <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 512.73 519.1 <NA> so nasa wanted me to take some pictures of moon sand so they sent me sand from all the different landings
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 519.84 525.08 <NA> of the apollo missions that happened forty years ago <unk> and i started taking pictures with my
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 526.57 528.29 <NA> <unk> this was the first picture i took it
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 528.04 531.74 <NA> was kind of amazing i thought it looked kind of a little bit like the moon <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 531.37 541.68 <NA> which is sort of interesting now the way my microscopes work is normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 541.68 550.02 <NA> keep taking pictures and then i have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 559.28 566.49 <NA> <unk> something 's interesting here <unk> this looks very different than any sand on earth that i 've ever seen and i 've seen a lot of sand on earth believe me 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 567.71 569.94 <NA> look at this hole in the middle 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 569.45 576.9 <NA> that hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the moon now the moon has no atmosphere so micrometeorites come in continuously

GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 618.79 624.72 <NA> basaltic lava flows <unk> and that 's what this sand looks like very similar to the sand that you would see in
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 627.35 636.36 <NA> <unk> other sands when these micrometeorites come in they vaporize and they make these fountains these microscopic fountains that go up into the
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 635.87 639.07 <NA> i was going to say up into the air but there is no air goes
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 638.62 648.91 <NA> sort of up and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly <unk> and they harden and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the moon <unk> 
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 648.86 654.61 <NA> <unk> they have these beautiful colored glass spherules and these are actually microscopic you need a microscope to see these
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 655.41 657.85 <NA> now here 's a grain of sand
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 657.72 667.78 <NA> that is from the moon <unk> and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there this grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion <unk>
GaryGreenberg_2012X 1 GaryGreenberg_2012X 667.68 673.76 <NA> <unk> years old <unk> and it 's never eroded away like the way we have sand on earth erodes away because of water
