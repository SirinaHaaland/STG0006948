SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 13.57 16.65 <NA> <unk> great to be back at ted why don 't i just start by firing
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 32.54 33.73 <NA> <unk> hang out with the flying club
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 60.69 62.15 <NA> <unk> okay
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 82.99 84.84 <NA> <unk> okay
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 154.9 158.93 <NA> <unk> this message from a nigerian prince he needs help
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 158.44 160.82 <NA> getting ten million dollars i
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 161.77 167.15 <NA> like to pay attention to these because that 's how we originally funded the company and it
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 167.56 174.66 <NA> 's gone pretty well though in all seriousness this position that you just saw me in
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 177.8 183.1 <NA> <unk> that 's one of the reasons behind this project project glass <unk> because
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 182.86 185.69 <NA> we ultimately questioned whether this is
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 185.53 191.73 <NA> the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life how you want to connect to information
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 191.69 196.71 <NA> <unk> should it be by just walking around looking down but
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 196.52 202.18 <NA> that was the vision behind glass <unk> and that 's why we 've created this form factor
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 207.42 208.96 <NA> <unk> okay <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 210.87 216 <NA> i don 't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot <unk> but i want to tell you a little bit more about
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 216 220.66 <NA> the motivation behind what led to it in addition to
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 220.83 225.08 <NA> potentially socially isolating yourself when you 're out and about looking
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 225 227.45 <NA> <unk> your phone it 's kind of 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 227.86 230.48 <NA> is this what you 're meant to do with your body 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 230.48 237.86 <NA> you 're standing around there and you 're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass you 're just kind of moving around 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 237.4 248.09 <NA> so when we developed glass we thought really about can we make something that frees your hands you saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 247.66 249.99 <NA> they were all wearing glass and that 's how we got that
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 252.44 261.75 <NA> <unk> and also you want something that frees your eyes that 's why we put the display up high out of your line of sight <unk> so it wouldn 't be where you 're looking
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 261.65 269.27 <NA> and it wouldn 't be where you 're making eye contact with people and also we wanted to free up the ears <unk> so
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 269.27 271.35 <NA> the sound actually
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 271.16 274.9 <NA> goes through <unk> conducts straight to the bones in your
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 275.88 278.14 <NA> <unk> little bit freaky at first but
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 277.68 286.72 <NA> you get used to it and ironically <unk> if you want to hear it better you actually just cover your ear <unk> which is kind of surprising but
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 286.89 291.79 <NA> that 's how it works my vision when we started google
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 291.69 300.05 <NA> fifteen years ago was that eventually you wouldn 't have to have a search query at all <unk> you 'd just have information come to you as you needed
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 301.06 304.35 <NA> <unk> and this is now fifteen years later sort of the first
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 304.35 310.94 <NA> form factor that i think can deliver that vision when you 're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 311.98 318.83 <NA> this project has lasted now been just over two years we 've learned an amazing amount 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 318.7 323.51 <NA> it 's been really important to make it comfortable so our first
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 323.38 328.62 <NA> prototypes we built were huge it was like cell phones strapped to your head it was very heavy
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 330.02 338.07 <NA> <unk> uncomfortable we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job and then she almost ran away
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 337.84 341.61 <NA> screaming <unk> but we 've come a long way <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 341.48 347.67 <NA> and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera our original prototypes didn 't have cameras at all
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 347.39 351.79 <NA> <unk> but it 's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 351.61 354.97 <NA> my family my kids i just never would have dug out
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 354.78 364.76 <NA> <unk> out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment <unk> and lastly i 've realized in experimenting with this device that
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 364.52 367.66 <NA> i also kind of have a nervous tic <unk>
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 367.38 374.78 <NA> the cell phone is yeah <unk> you have to look down on it and all that but it 's also kind of a nervous habit like
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 374.57 379.64 <NA> if i smoked i 'd probably just smoke instead i would just light up a cigarette it would look cooler
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 382.51 389.33 <NA> but in this case you know i whip this out and i sit there and look as if i have something very important to do or attend to 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 389.17 393.32 <NA> but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 392.89 395.21 <NA> <unk> i spent
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 394.75 404.07 <NA> just secluding away be it email or social posts or whatnot <unk> even though it wasn 't really there 's nothing really that important or that pressing
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 404.84 412.41 <NA> <unk> and with this i know i will get certain messages if i really need them but i don 't have to be checking them all the time yeah
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 412.91 419.4 <NA> i 've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2013 1 SergeyBrin_2013 421.07 422.59 <NA> thank you all very much
