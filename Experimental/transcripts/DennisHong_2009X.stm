DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 23.86 29.91 <NA> but have you seen anything in nature an animal that has three legs probably not so why do i call this
DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 29.9 35.64 <NA> <unk> biologically inspired robot how would it work but before that let 's look at pop culture so you know <unk>
DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 36.71 40.72 <NA> <unk> worlds novel and movie and what you see over here is a very popular
DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 40.72 54.46 <NA> video game and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize earth but my robot strider does not move like this <unk> so <unk> this is an actual dynamic simulation animation

DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 56.3 66.67 <NA> it flips its body one hundred and eighty degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall so that 's how it walks but when you look at us human being bipedal walking what you 're doing <unk>
DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 66.57 77.15 <NA> <unk> is you 're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot right <unk> what you 're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall stand up again swing your leg and catch the fall
DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 79.93 81.92 <NA> <unk> body just like a pendulum <unk>

DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 91.57 104.97 <NA> it 's a constantly falling process so <unk> even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this really we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot thus it 's a biologically inspired robot <unk> what you see over
DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 104.99 106.59 <NA> <unk> here this is what we want to do next we
DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 106.58 119.83 <NA> want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long range motion and it deploys legs it looks almost like star wars when it lands it absorbs the shock and starts walking what you see over here this yellow thing this is not a death ray this is
DennisHong_2009X 1 DennisHong_2009X 119.64 124.93 <NA> just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors because it is tall it 's one point eight meters tall
