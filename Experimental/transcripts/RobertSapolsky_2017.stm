RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 360.53 370.96 <NA> now we have to look at hours to days before <unk> and with this we have entered the realm of hormones for example testosterone where regardless of your sex <unk>
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 370.91 378.8 <NA> if you have elevated testosterone levels in your blood you 're more likely to think a face with a neutral expression is instead looking threatening

RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 413.81 425.2 <NA> but we push back even more back years back for example to your adolescence now the central fact of the adolescent brain is all of it is going full blast except

RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 444.27 452.9 <NA> but pushing back even further even further back to childhood and fetal life and all the different versions that that could come in now 
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 452.9 454.97 <NA> obviously that 's the time that your brain
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 455.11 463.59 <NA> <unk> is being constructed and that 's important <unk> but in addition experience during those times produce what are called epigenetic changes <unk>

RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 476.3 484.86 <NA> <unk> epigenetics is going to produce your amygdala in adulthood as a more excitable form and you 're going to have elevated stress hormone levels <unk> 
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 484.46 491.27 <NA> but pushing even further back back to when you were just a fetus back to when all you were was a collection of genes <unk> 
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 491.27 500.62 <NA> now genes are really important to all of this but critically genes don 't determine anything <unk> because genes work differently in different environments 
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 500.38 503.65 <NA> key example here there 's a variant of a gene called
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 505.05 511.31 <NA> <unk> and if you have that variant you are far more likely to commit antisocial violence
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 511.13 515.26 <NA> if and only if you were abused as a child 
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 515.26 523.64 <NA> genes and environment interact <unk> and what 's happening in that one second before you pull that trigger reflects your lifetime of those
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 526.84 533.99 <NA> <unk> remarkably enough we 've got to push even further back now <unk> back centuries what were your ancestors up to 
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 533.59 543.84 <NA> and if for example <unk> they were nomadic pastoralists they were pastoralists people living in deserts or grasslands with their herds of camels cows goats

RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 554.98 559.32 <NA> that would still be influencing the values with which you were raised <unk> 
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 559.28 569.35 <NA> but we 've got to push even further back back millions of years because if we 're talking about genes implicitly we 're now talking about the evolution of genes 
RobertSapolsky_2017 1 RobertSapolsky_2017 569.35 579.94 <NA> and what you see is for example <unk> patterns across different primate species some of them have evolved for extremely low levels of aggression others have evolved in the
