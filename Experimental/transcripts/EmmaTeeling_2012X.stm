EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 14.28 21.93 <NA> is to think of this mammal that i 'm going to describe to you the first thing i 'm going to tell you about this mammal
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 21.93 24.84 <NA> is that it is essential for our ecosystems to
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 26.6 33.6 <NA> <unk> if we remove this mammal from our ecosystems <unk> they simply will not work that 's the first thing 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 33.83 40.47 <NA> the second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 40.47 44.77 <NA> if we study this mammal we 're going to get great insight
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 44.59 50.23 <NA> into our diseases of the senses <unk> such as blindness and deafness
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 51.18 58.57 <NA> <unk> and the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that i fully believe
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 58.11 60.93 <NA> that the secret of everlasting youth
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 60.77 69.01 <NA> lies deep within its dna <unk> so are you all thinking so 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 69.6 75.58 <NA> magnificent creature isn 't it who here thought of a bat ah
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 76.26 79.97 <NA> i can see half the audience agrees with me and i have a lot of work to do
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 79.9 84.01 <NA> <unk> to convince the rest of you <unk> so i have had the good fortune
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 83.85 90.32 <NA> for the past twenty years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 90.37 100.05 <NA> one fifth of all living mammals is a bat <unk> and they have very unique attributes bats as we know them have been around on this planet
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 104.24 109.8 <NA> <unk> one of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 109.7 119.13 <NA> now flight is an inherently difficult thing flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times once in the bats <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 118.91 123.06 <NA> once in the birds <unk> and once in the pterodactyls <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 122.6 129.55 <NA> and so with flight it 's very metabolically costly <unk> bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 130.59 135.16 <NA> but one other extremely unique thing about bats is
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 134.73 144.46 <NA> that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment they use echolocation now what i mean by echolocation
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 144.03 146.74 <NA> they emit a sound from their larynx
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 146.74 154.91 <NA> out through their mouth or through their nose this sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 155.02 162.47 <NA> <unk> their environment <unk> and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 162.07 166.64 <NA> and this enables them to orient in complete darkness 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 166.42 175.14 <NA> indeed they do look very strange we 're humans we 're a visual species when scientists first realized that bats were actually
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 175.01 180.58 <NA> <unk> using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night <unk> we didn 't believe it 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 180.58 186.81 <NA> for a hundred years despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing <unk> we didn 't believe it 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 186.53 188.26 <NA> now if you look
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 187.93 190.92 <NA> at this bat it looks a little bit alien <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 190.58 195.15 <NA> indeed the very famous philosopher thomas nagel once said 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 195.15 204.79 <NA> to truly experience an alien life form on this planet you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying echolocating bat in complete darkness
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 204.99 211.5 <NA> and if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 211.5 217.51 <NA> you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 217.11 224.96 <NA> very big ears strange nose leaves <unk> but teeny tiny eyes <unk> so again if you just look at this
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 225.55 229.13 <NA> <unk> you realize sound is very important for its survival 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 229.21 233.72 <NA> most bats look like the previous one <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 233.32 237.56 <NA> however there are a group that do not use echolocation 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 237.33 240.65 <NA> they do not perceive their environment using sound 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 240.65 250.2 <NA> and these are the flying foxes <unk> if anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in australia you 've seen them coming out of the botanic gardens in sydney <unk> and if you just look
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 251.99 255.84 <NA> <unk> you can see they have much much larger eyes and much smaller ears <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 255.38 262.11 <NA> so among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 261.62 271.53 <NA> now this is going to be important for what i 'm going to tell you later during the talk now if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 271.04 277.23 <NA> and i know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 277.52 279.55 <NA> that 's probably not that surprising
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 280.05 292.07 <NA> <unk> because here in western culture <unk> bats have been demonized really of course the famous book dracula written by a fellow northside dubliner bram stoker probably is mainly responsible for this <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 292.07 303.19 <NA> however i also think it 's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night <unk> and we don 't really understand them we 're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 302.82 304.97 <NA> bats are usually synonymous with some type

EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 310.66 313.04 <NA> also if you think about it 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 312.55 319.79 <NA> demons always have bat wings <unk> whereas birds <unk> they typically or angels have bird wings <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 321.55 329.97 <NA> now this is western society and what i hope to do tonight is to convince you of the chinese traditional culture
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 329.69 332.61 <NA> <unk> culture that they perceive bats
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 332.12 335.55 <NA> as creatures that bring good luck <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 335.18 340.84 <NA> and indeed if you walk into a chinese home you may see an image such as this 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 340.84 347.37 <NA> this is considered the five blessings the chinese word for bat sounds like the chinese word for happiness 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 346.94 349.99 <NA> and they believe that bats bring

EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 360.9 368.08 <NA> is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 368.08 373.42 <NA> and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings

EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 530.17 533.12 <NA> so i want you to look at the person beside you just
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 533.05 540.56 <NA> have a quick look and what we need to realize is that every three hundred base pairs in your dna you 're a little bit different <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 540.22 544.77 <NA> and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 544.59 547.32 <NA> is to work out whether this variation
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 547.13 554.97 <NA> makes you more susceptible to diseases or does this variation just make you different <unk> again what does it mean here what does this
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 554.93 563.04 <NA> <unk> variation actually mean <unk> so if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 562.81 571.68 <NA> that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years <unk> we have to be able to differentiate between the two <unk> so how do we do this well
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 571.79 575.49 <NA> i believe we just look at nature 's experiments <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 575.9 579.94 <NA> so through natural selection over time

EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 587.1 595.63 <NA> evolution acts as a sieve <unk> it sieves out the bad variation <unk> and so therefore if you look at the same region of a genome
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 595.2 603.5 <NA> in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent you
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 605.11 618.68 <NA> <unk> of what the evolutionary prior of that site is i e if it is important for the mammal to function for its survival <unk> it will be the same in all of those different lineages species <unk> taxa <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 618.55 620.6 <NA> so therefore <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 620.26 629.43 <NA> if we were to do this what we 'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it 's the same or if it 's different <unk> so if it is
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 629.96 637.75 <NA> <unk> the same this indicates that that site is important for a function so a disease mutation should fall within that site <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 637.51 639.67 <NA> so in this case here 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 639.67 647.31 <NA> if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow type genome at that site <unk> it probably suggests that purple is bad 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 647.84 654.97 <NA> this could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently so say for example the region
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 655.01 659.35 <NA> of the genome that i was looking at was a region that 's important for vision <unk>

EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 664.25 670.9 <NA> and we find that bats that don 't see so well have the purple type we know that this is probably what 's causing
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 670.41 678.77 <NA> this disease <unk> so in my lab we 've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 679.93 683.06 <NA> 're looking at blindness now why would you do this <unk>

EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 687.83 699.99 <NA> and forty five million of these are blind so blindness is a big problem <unk> and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases <unk> so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 700.49 701.76 <NA> <unk> the disease 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 701.54 703.95 <NA> also we look at deafness

EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 905.59 912.39 <NA> <unk> molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 912.39 919.13 <NA> and hopefully in the next five years i 'll be giving you a tedtalk on that aging is a big problem for humanity <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 918.94 925.2 <NA> and i believe that by studying bats we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 927.53 933.99 <NA> <unk> if we find out what they 're doing <unk> perhaps through gene therapy <unk> we can enable us to do the same thing <unk> 
EmmaTeeling_2012X 1 EmmaTeeling_2012X 933.74 941.17 <NA> potentially this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it <unk> just imagine what that would be like
