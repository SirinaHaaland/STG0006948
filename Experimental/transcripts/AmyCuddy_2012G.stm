AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 115.24 124.93 <NA> it 's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions <unk> so what is your body language communicating to me what 's mine communicating to
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 129.12 133 <NA> <unk> this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 132.83 141.81 <NA> looking at the effects of of our body language or other people 's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 141.81 147.88 <NA> and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 147.39 149.75 <NA> who we ask out on a date for
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 151.87 156.11 <NA> <unk> nalini ambady a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch <unk>

AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 212.63 219.08 <NA> <unk> we are also influenced by our nonverbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology <unk> so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 229.96 237.29 <NA> <unk> power dynamics i became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 236.89 250.23 <NA> <unk> and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom <unk> they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out <unk> you take up space you 're basically
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 251.12 253.35 <NA> <unk> it 's about opening up <unk> and
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 253.18 257.88 <NA> this is true across the animal kingdom it 's not just limited to primates 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 257.87 260.34 <NA> and humans do the same thing 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 260.3 264.7 <NA> so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 264.7 270.82 <NA> and also when they 're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 270.65 279.79 <NA> how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 279.75 284.72 <NA> <unk> shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 284.54 293.06 <NA> do this when they win at a physical competition <unk> so when they cross the finish line and they 've won it doesn 't matter if they 've never seen anyone do it they do this <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 293.06 296.92 <NA> so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 296.43 299.93 <NA> what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 300.28 309.65 <NA> <unk> we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don 't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 309.43 315.24 <NA> and this is what happens when you put together high and low power <unk> so what we tend to do
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 314.85 325.44 <NA> when it comes to power is that we complement the other 's nonverbals so if someone is being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller <unk> we don 't mirror them we do the opposite of them
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 325.44 327.02 <NA> <unk> so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 326.53 328.95 <NA> i 'm watching this behavior in the classroom
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 330.23 333.42 <NA> what do i notice i notice that
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 333.98 345.04 <NA> mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas really coming into the room they get right into the middle of the room
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 344.65 352.35 <NA> before class even starts like they really want to occupy space <unk> when they sit down they 're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 352.1 355 <NA> <unk> you have other people who are virtually collapsing
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 355.29 364.78 <NA> <unk> when they come in as soon they come in you see it <unk> you see it on their faces and their bodies <unk> and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 364.8 371.98 <NA> i notice a couple of things about this one you 're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 372.09 374.93 <NA> women are much more likely to do this kind of
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 375 380.87 <NA> <unk> than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 380.65 394.88 <NA> <unk> but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half the grade 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 394.72 396.35 <NA> so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 395.86 402.62 <NA> business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 402.4 404.82 <NA> and then you get these differences in grades and it
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 405.02 407.5 <NA> <unk> to be partly attributable to participation 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 407.29 410.59 <NA> so i started to wonder <unk> you know okay <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 410.59 419.59 <NA> so you have these people coming in like this and they 're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 419.41 425.2 <NA> my main collaborator dana carney who 's at berkeley <unk> and i really wanted to know
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 425.4 429.3 <NA> <unk> can you fake it till you make it <unk> like can you do this just for a little while
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 429.14 436.02 <NA> and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful <unk> so we know that our nonverbals
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 435.86 445.27 <NA> govern how other people think and feel about us there 's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 445.65 450.11 <NA> there 's some evidence that they do so for example
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 451.09 457.28 <NA> <unk> we smile when we feel happy but also when we 're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 457.21 462.86 <NA> it makes us feel happy <unk> so it goes both ways <unk> when it comes to power 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 462.94 471.74 <NA> it also goes both ways <unk> so when you when you feel powerful you 're more likely to do this <unk> but it 's also possible that
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 471.46 478.62 <NA> when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 480.11 489.06 <NA> <unk> question really was <unk> you know <unk> so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 488.93 494.92 <NA> and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i 'm talking about thoughts
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 494.71 499.9 <NA> and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that 's
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 500.79 508.75 <NA> <unk> i look at hormones <unk> so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like <unk> so powerful people
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 508.41 518.08 <NA> tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more optimistic <unk> they actually feel they 're going to win even at games of chance
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 518.25 524.99 <NA> <unk> they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 525 527.63 <NA> differences between powerful and powerless people 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 527.17 535.64 <NA> physiologically there also are differences on two key hormones <unk> testosterone which is the dominance hormone <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 535.15 538.16 <NA> and cortisol which is the stress hormone <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 537.85 539.3 <NA> so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 538.87 541.43 <NA> what we find is that
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 543.87 549.8 <NA> alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol <unk> and
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 549.31 554.76 <NA> powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 554.93 561.17 <NA> <unk> so what does that mean when you think about power people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 561.18 567.07 <NA> but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 566.9 578.44 <NA> that 's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who 's powerful and assertive and dominant <unk> but not very stress reactive the person who 's laid back
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 579.9 581.27 <NA> <unk> we know that
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 581.72 587.26 <NA> in primate hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 586.89 590.98 <NA> <unk> if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 590.61 602.75 <NA> within a few days that individual 's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly <unk> so we have this evidence <unk> both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 604.84 610.46 <NA> <unk> that role changes can shape the mind <unk> so what happens okay you take a role change 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 610.42 620.33 <NA> what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it 's going to make you feel more powerful 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 620.23 622.04 <NA> so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 621.7 624.87 <NA> this is what we did <unk> we decided to bring
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 635.21 640.83 <NA> <unk> just going to show you five of the poses although they took on only two so here 's one a
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 641.51 650.13 <NA> couple more <unk> this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media <unk> here are a couple more <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 650.13 657.7 <NA> <unk> so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you 're folding up you 're making yourself small <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 658.26 665.09 <NA> this one is very low power when you 're touching your neck you 're really protecting yourself <unk> so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 664.76 679.06 <NA> this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial for two minutes we say you need to do this or this they don 't look at pictures of the poses we don 't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power so two minutes they do this <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 678.63 679.94 <NA> we then ask them
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 680.04 685.31 <NA> how powerful do you feel on a series of items <unk> and then we give them an opportunity to gamble 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 685.08 693.24 <NA> and then we take another saliva sample that 's it that 's the whole experiment <unk> so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 693.24 704.94 <NA> we find that when you are in the high power pose condition eighty six percent of you will gamble when you 're in the low power pose condition only sixty percent and that 's a whopping significant difference
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 704.9 714 <NA> here 's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high power people experience about a 20 percent increase 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 714.14 721.03 <NA> and low power people experience about a 10 percent decrease <unk> so again two minutes <unk> and you get these changes 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 721.03 724.81 <NA> here 's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 731.19 741.16 <NA> <unk> so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really <unk>
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 742.97 747.31 <NA> and feeling sort of shut down and we 've all had the feeling right <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 747.18 754.97 <NA> so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it 's not just others but it 's also ourselves
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 755.14 758.42 <NA> also our bodies change our minds <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 757.93 766.58 <NA> but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways <unk> this is in the lab it 's this little task it 's
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 766.58 768.3 <NA> just a couple of minutes
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 768.06 771.92 <NA> <unk> where can you actually apply this <unk> which we cared about of course
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 771.67 773.13 <NA> <unk> and so we think
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 780.07 794.97 <NA> situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends for teenagers it 's at the lunchroom table for some people it 's speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 794.51 802.77 <NA> doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview <unk> so
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 802.7 803.95 <NA> we published these
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 805.02 810.61 <NA> <unk> and the media are all over it and they say <unk> okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 811.26 825.05 <NA> so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no that 's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no don 't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it 's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 826.3 831.02 <NA> <unk> you 're sitting down you 're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 831.78 842.06 <NA> you 're looking at your notes you 're hunching up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes <unk> so that 's what we want to test okay so <unk>
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 841.96 849.99 <NA> <unk> we bring people into a lab and they do either high or low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 850.19 857.17 <NA> <unk> it 's five minutes long they are being recorded they 're being judged also and the judges
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 856.96 864.12 <NA> are trained to give no nonverbal feedback <unk> so they look like this imagine this is the person interviewing you 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 863.81 874.06 <NA> so for five minutes <unk> nothing <unk> and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it 's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 874.01 879.91 <NA> <unk> so this really spikes your cortisol <unk> so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 880.26 889.61 <NA> we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they 're blind to the hypothesis <unk> they 're blind to the conditions they have no idea who 's been posing in what pose <unk> 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 889.61 892.72 <NA> and they they end up
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 892.29 900.17 <NA> looking at these sets of tapes and they say we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don 't want to hire these people 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 900.13 903.77 <NA> <unk> we also evaluate these people much more positively overall 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 903.6 914.3 <NA> but what 's driving it <unk> it 's not about the content of the speech <unk> it 's about the presence that they 're bringing to the speech because we rate them on all these variables related to competence <unk>
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 914.25 923.16 <NA> like <unk> how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what 's affected these kinds of things 
AmyCuddy_2012G 1 AmyCuddy_2012G 930.01 937.44 <NA> <unk> residue over them <unk> so this is what 's driving the effect or mediating mediating the effect <unk> so
