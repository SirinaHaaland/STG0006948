CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 209.82 215.39 <NA> so how did we get here and more importantly what are we going to do about it <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 215.39 223.19 <NA> well to answer the slightly easier question first about ten thousand years ago i would say is the beginning of this process
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 222.95 227.89 <NA> in the ancient near east known as the fertile crescent because as you can
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 227.43 229.97 <NA> see it was crescent shaped and it was also

CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 230.91 241.62 <NA> and it was here about ten thousand years ago <unk> that two extraordinary inventions agriculture and urbanism happened roughly in the same place and at the same time <unk>
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 241.62 243.96 <NA> this is no accident <unk> because
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 243.63 248.15 <NA> agriculture and cities are bound together <unk> they need each other <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 248.15 254.91 <NA> because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 254.92 259.5 <NA> large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 259.64 270.69 <NA> and if we look at what those settlements were like we see they were compact <unk> they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur <unk>

CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 285.36 294.07 <NA> <unk> so if you like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 294.21 300.14 <NA> and in fact that 's true of every ancient city <unk> but of course not all of them were that small
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 301.54 306.83 <NA> <unk> had about a million citizens by the first century a d so how did a city like this
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 306.66 308.45 <NA> feed itself 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 308.83 312.41 <NA> the answer is what i call ancient food miles 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 311.95 325.05 <NA> basically rome had access to the sea which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away <unk> this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 325.73 328.12 <NA> <unk> and the food obviously went off very quickly <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 328.12 339.82 <NA> so rome effectively waged war on places like carthage and egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves and in fact <unk> you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 339.49 344.47 <NA> long drawn out militarized shopping spree really 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 344.47 354.94 <NA> in fact i love the fact i just have to mention this rome in fact used to import oysters from london at one stage i think that 's extraordinary so rome shaped its hinterland
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 355.04 356.83 <NA> through its appetite <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 356.79 369.19 <NA> but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre industrial world if we look at a map of london in the 17th century we can see that its grain <unk> which is coming in from the thames along the bottom of this map 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 368.88 374.66 <NA> so the grain markets were to the south of the city <unk> and the roads leading up from them to
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 375.31 386.12 <NA> <unk> which was the main market were also grain markets and if you look at the name of one of those streets bread street you can tell what was going on there three hundred years ago 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 385.81 396.6 <NA> and the same of course was true for fish fish was of course coming in by river as well same thing and of course billingsgate famously was london 's fish market <unk> operating on site here until the
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 397.66 399.96 <NA> <unk> which is extraordinary really when you think about it <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 400 407.49 <NA> <unk> everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 408.1 412.83 <NA> this is another thing about food in cities once its roots into the city are established 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 412.83 424.99 <NA> they very rarely move meat is a very different story because of course animals could walk into the city <unk> so much of london 's meat was coming from the northwest from scotland and wales <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 425.31 438.64 <NA> <unk> coming in and arriving at the city at the northwest which is why smithfield london 's very famous meat market was located up there poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on to the northeast i feel a bit like a weather woman doing this anyway 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 438.96 441.67 <NA> and so the birds were coming in
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 441.27 450.14 <NA> with their feet protected with little canvas shoes <unk> and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside that 's where they were sold which is why it 's called
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 451.39 454.73 <NA> <unk> in fact if you look at the map of any city
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 454.81 464.31 <NA> built before the industrial age you can trace food coming in to it you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food both by reading
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 464.26 470.4 <NA> <unk> the names of the streets which give you a lot of clues <unk> friday street in a previous life is where you went to buy your fish on a friday <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 480.01 492.27 <NA> and thirty you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from in fact if you were having sunday lunch the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 491.81 497.22 <NA> so this was obviously an organic city part of an organic cycle <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 497.39 504.88 <NA> and then ten years later everything changed this is an image of the great western in one thousand eight hundred and forty and as you can see some of the
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 504.84 508.39 <NA> <unk> earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 508.39 520.51 <NA> so all of a sudden these animals are no longer walking into market <unk> they 're being slaughtered out of sight and mind somewhere in the countryside and they 're coming into the city by rail <unk> and this changes everything 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 520.89 529.01 <NA> to start off with it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities really any size and shape in any place cities used to be constrained by geography
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 530.05 537.5 <NA> <unk> to have to get their food through very difficult physical means all of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography <unk> 
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 537.04 547.61 <NA> and as you can see from these maps of london in the ninety years after the trains came it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot <unk>
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 547.56 554.55 <NA> and so on to a large splurge that would be very very difficult to feed with anybody on foot either animals or people
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 555.41 564.69 <NA> and of course that was just the beginning after the trains came cars <unk> and really this marks the end of this process it 's the final emancipation <unk>
CarolynSteel_2009G 1 CarolynSteel_2009G 564.59 576.37 <NA> <unk> of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all <unk> and this is the kind of city that 's devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape
