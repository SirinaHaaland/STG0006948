AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 18.91 28.23 <NA> and it was a survey that measured levels of numeracy in the population <unk> and they were shocked to find out that for every one hundred working age adults

AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 30.07 35.02 <NA> lacked level one numeracy skills now level one numeracy skills that 's
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 36.29 44.22 <NA> <unk> score it 's the ability to deal with fractions <unk> percentages and decimals so this figure prompted a lot of hand wringing in
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 43.85 53.53 <NA> whitehall policies were changed investments were made and then they ran the survey again in two thousand and eleven <unk> so can you guess what happened to this number
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 55.95 63.97 <NA> <unk> it went up to forty nine and in fact when i reported this figure in the ft one of our readers joked and said this figure
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 63.97 67.27 <NA> is only shocking to fifty one percent of the population 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 68.64 74.93 <NA> but i preferred actually <unk> the reaction of a schoolchild when i presented at a school this information
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 75.4 83.72 <NA> <unk> raised their hand and said how do we know that the person who made that number isn 't one of the forty nine percent either so
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 83.59 91.82 <NA> clearly there 's a numeracy issue because these are important skills for life and a lot of the changes that we want to introduce
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 91.48 94.81 <NA> in this century involve us becoming more comfortable with numbers <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 94.81 101.87 <NA> now <unk> it 's not just an english problem <unk> oecd this year released some figures looking at numeracy in young people 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 101.56 105 <NA> and leading the way <unk> the usa nearly
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 105.02 111.99 <NA> <unk> forty percent of young people in the us have low numeracy now england is there too but there are <unk>
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 113.56 120.55 <NA> seven oecd countries with figures above twenty percent that is a problem because it doesn 't have to be that way if you look at the far end of this graph 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 120.55 124.17 <NA> you can see the netherlands and korea are in single figures
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 123.71 126 <NA> so there 's definitely
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 125.99 129.61 <NA> a numeracy problem that we want to address now
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 129.66 139.4 <NA> <unk> useful as studies like these are i think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories that there are two kinds of people 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 139.4 145.78 <NA> those people that are comfortable with numbers that can do numbers <unk> and the people who can <unk>
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 146.91 150.05 <NA> <unk> i 'm trying to talk about here today is to say that i believe that that
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 150.16 153.14 <NA> <unk> a false dichotomy <unk> it 's not an immutable pairing <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 153.14 162.14 <NA> i think you don 't have to have tremendously high levels of numeracy to be inspired by numbers <unk> and that that should be the starting point to the journey ahead
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 163 173.48 <NA> and one of the ways in which we can begin that journey for me is looking at statistics now i am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat of an image problem 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 173.77 179.97 <NA> laughter it 's the part of mathematics that even mathematicians don 't particularly like because whereas the rest of
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 179.96 187.32 <NA> <unk> maths is all about precision and certainty statistics is almost the reverse of that <unk> but actually
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 187.32 193.74 <NA> i was a late convert to the world of statistics myself <unk> if you 'd asked my undergraduate professors what two
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 193.55 203.41 <NA> subjects would i be least likely to excel in after university they 'd have told you statistics and computer programming <unk> and yet here i am about to show you some statistical graphics that i programmed
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 205.02 210.04 <NA> <unk> inspired that change in me what made me think that statistics was actually an interesting thing <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 209.64 215.15 <NA> it 's really because statistics are about us <unk> if you look at the etymology of the word statistics 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 215.15 223.75 <NA> it 's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in so statistics are about us as a group 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 223.38 229.88 <NA> not us as individuals and i think as social animals we share this fascination about how we as individuals
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 229.84 237.2 <NA> <unk> relate to our groups to our peers and statistics in this way are at their most powerful when they surprise us
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 237.19 242.16 <NA> <unk> and there 's been some really wonderful surveys carried out recently by ipsos mori in the last few years 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 242.16 249.99 <NA> they did a survey of over one thousand adults in the uk and said <unk> for every one hundred people in england and wales <unk> how many of them are muslim <unk>
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 250.73 257.26 <NA> <unk> now the average answer from this survey which was supposed to be representative of the total population was
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 258.62 266.31 <NA> that 's what people thought british people think twenty four out of every one hundred people in the country are muslim now official figures
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 266.15 268.92 <NA> reveal that figure to be about five <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 269.15 278.64 <NA> so there 's this big variation between what we think our perception <unk> and the reality as as given by statistics and i think that 's interesting what could possibly be causing
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 278.27 279.97 <NA> that misperception
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 280.65 289.91 <NA> and i was so thrilled with this study i started to take questions out in presentations i was referring to it now <unk> i did a presentation at st paul 's school for girls in hammersmith <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 289.91 297.25 <NA> and i had an audience rather like this except it was comprised entirely of sixth form girls <unk> and i said 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 297.15 298.9 <NA> girls <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 299.04 300.82 <NA> how many
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 300.42 304.97 <NA> teenage girls do you think the british public think get pregnant every
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 304.9 309.02 <NA> <unk> year and the girls were apoplectic when i said
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 308.89 314.9 <NA> the british public think that fifteen out of every one hundred teenage girls get pregnant in the year <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 314.86 324.29 <NA> and they had every right to be angry <unk> because in fact i 'd have to have closer to two hundred dots before i could color one in in terms of what the official figures tell us 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 324.04 325.14 <NA> and rather
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 325.04 331.03 <NA> <unk> like numeracy this is not just an english problem <unk> ipsos mori expanded the survey in recent years
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 330.85 332.88 <NA> to go across the world <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 332.39 341.58 <NA> and so they asked saudi arabians for every one hundred adults in your country <unk> how many of them are overweight or obese <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 341.99 345.39 <NA> and the average answer from the saudis
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 344.9 346.44 <NA> was
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 346.04 349.81 <NA> just over a quarter that 's what they thought just over a quarter of
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 350.31 355.45 <NA> <unk> overweight or obese the official figures show actually <unk> it 's nearer
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 355.65 357.7 <NA> to three quarters 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 358.32 363.76 <NA> so again a big variation <unk> and i love this one they asked in japan
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 363.45 369.65 <NA> <unk> they asked the japanese for every one hundred japanese people how many of them live in rural areas <unk>
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 371.94 374.81 <NA> <unk> the average was about a 50 50 split just over
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 376.42 383.03 <NA> <unk> of every one hundred japanese people lived in rural areas <unk> the official figure is seven so
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 382.9 391.46 <NA> extraordinary variations and surprising to some but not surprising to people who have read the work of daniel kahneman for example the <unk>
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 392.49 395.84 <NA> economist he and his colleague <unk> amos tversky spent
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 395.83 404.85 <NA> years researching this disjoint between what people perceive and the reality the fact that people are actually pretty poor intuitive statisticians
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 405.05 414.24 <NA> and there are many reasons for this individual experiences certainly can influence our perceptions but so too can things like the media reporting things by exception 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 414.24 416.58 <NA> rather than what 's normal 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 416.3 426.67 <NA> kahneman had a nice way of referring to that he said we can be blind to the obvious so we 've got the numbers wrong but we can be blind to our blindness about it and that has enormous repercussions
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 426.51 429.97 <NA> for decision making so at the statistics office while
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 429.93 437.41 <NA> <unk> this was all going on i thought this was really interesting i said this is clearly a global problem but maybe geography is the issue here
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 437.55 442.82 <NA> <unk> these were questions that were all about how well do you know your country <unk> so in this case it 's
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 442.59 450.67 <NA> how well do you know <unk> sixty four million people not very well it turns out i can 't do that so i had an idea which was
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 450.27 454.79 <NA> to think about this same sort of approach but to think about it in a very local sense
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 454.96 462.59 <NA> <unk> is this a local <unk> if we reframe the questions and say how well do you know your local area would your answers be any more accurate <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 463.6 467.57 <NA> so i devised a quiz <unk> how well do you know your area <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 467.92 475.08 <NA> it 's a simple web app you put in a post code and then it will ask you questions based on census data for your local
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 476.45 479.2 <NA> <unk> and i was very conscious in designing this i wanted to make it
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 478.96 488.52 <NA> open to the widest possible range of people not just the forty nine percent who can get the numbers i wanted everyone to engage with it so for the design of the quiz
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 488.15 495.85 <NA> i was inspired by the isotypes of otto neurath from the 1920s and ' 30s now these
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 495.66 498.27 <NA> are methods for representing
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 497.9 500.32 <NA> numbers using repeating
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 502.11 504.73 <NA> <unk> the numbers are there but they sit in the background 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 504.27 512.42 <NA> so it 's a great way of representing quantity without resorting to using terms like percentage fractions and ratios so
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 512.09 513.91 <NA> here 's the quiz <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 513.72 524.09 <NA> the layout of the quiz is you have your repeating icons on the <unk> left hand side there and a map showing you the area we 're asking you questions about on the right hand side there are seven questions 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 524.09 525.35 <NA> each question
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 525.49 533.87 <NA> <unk> there 's a possible answer between zero and a hundred and at the end of the quiz you get an overall score between zero and a hundred and so because this is <unk>
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 534.96 538.5 <NA> i thought we would have a quick look at the quiz for the first few questions
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 538.32 544.43 <NA> of exeter and so the first question is for every one hundred people <unk> how many are aged under sixteen <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 544.18 549.87 <NA> now <unk> i don 't know exeter very well at all so i had a guess at this but it gives you an idea of how this quiz
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 550.82 552.36 <NA> <unk> you drag the slider
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 552.16 554.46 <NA> to highlight your icons <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 554.23 560.35 <NA> and then just click submit to answer and we animate away the difference between your answer and reality <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 560.14 564.88 <NA> and it turns out i was a pretty terrible guess five <unk> 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 564.88 572.77 <NA> how about the next question this is asking about what the average age is so the age at which half the population are younger and half the population are older and i thought
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 580.5 585.55 <NA> <unk> in exeter it 's incredibly young and i had underestimated the impact of the university
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 585.35 591.52 <NA> in this area <unk> the questions get harder as you go through <unk> so this one 's now asking about homeownership 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 591.36 599 <NA> for every one hundred households how many are owned with a mortgage or loan <unk> and i hedged my bets here because i didn 't want to be more than fifty out
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 598.79 599.93 <NA> on the answer
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 602.65 609.41 <NA> <unk> these get harder these questions because when you 're in an area when you 're in a community things like age
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 609.16 616.64 <NA> there are clues to whether a population is old or young just by looking around the area you can see it something like homeownership
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 616.24 625.14 <NA> is much more difficult to see so we revert to our own heuristics our own biases about how many people we think own their own homes
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 626.3 633.67 <NA> <unk> the truth is when we published this quiz <unk> the census data that it 's based on was already a few years old we 've had
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 633.67 641.1 <NA> online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years <unk> so in some senses this was all a little bit
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 640.61 645.03 <NA> old and and not necessarily new but i was interested to see
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 644.54 654.94 <NA> what reaction we might get by <unk> gamifying the data in the way that we have by using animation and playing on the fact that people have their own preconceptions
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 655.35 658.99 <NA> <unk> it turns out <unk> the reaction was um 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 659.82 666.7 <NA> was more than i could have hoped for it was a long held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website due to public demand 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 668.7 674.99 <NA> laughter this url contains the words statistics gov and uk which are three of people 's least favorite words in a
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 675.85 679.58 <NA> <unk> and the amazing thing about this was that the website came down
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 679.15 683.3 <NA> at quarter to ten at night because people were actually
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 683.13 688.55 <NA> engaging with this data of their own free will using their own personal time
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 688.45 693.74 <NA> <unk> i was very interested to see that we got something like a quarter of a million
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 693.85 699.84 <NA> people playing the quiz within the space of forty eight hours of launching it and it sparked an enormous
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 701.09 704.16 <NA> <unk> on social media which was largely dominated
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 703.67 709.83 <NA> by people having fun with their misconceptions which is something that i
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 709.63 718.17 <NA> i couldn 't have hoped for any better in some respects i also liked the fact that people started sending it to politicians <unk> how well do you know the area you claim to represent 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 718.88 721.17 <NA> and then just to finish 
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 721.4 729.94 <NA> going back to the two kinds of people <unk> i thought it would be really interesting to see how people who are good with numbers would do on this quiz <unk> the national
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 729.9 738.37 <NA> <unk> statistician of england and wales <unk> john pullinger you would expect he would be pretty good he got forty four for his own area

AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 741.96 750.23 <NA> admittedly after a glass of wine thirty six even worse <unk> it just shows you that the numbers can inspire
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 750.55 762.75 <NA> <unk> can surprise us all so very often we talk about statistics as being the science of uncertainty my parting thought for today is actually statistics is the science of us <unk> and that 's why we should be fascinated
AlanSmith_2016X 1 AlanSmith_2016X 762.75 764.64 <NA> by numbers thank you very much
