SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 13.36 22.76 <NA> <unk> a child growing up in maine <unk> one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of maine <unk> because my parents told me it would bring me luck <unk> 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 22.76 24 <NA> but you know <unk> 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 23.76 24.99 <NA> these shells they 're hard to
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 25.61 28.53 <NA> <unk> they 're covered in sand they 're difficult to see 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 28.25 36.81 <NA> however over time i got used to looking for them i started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 37.37 43.36 <NA> this grew into a passion for finding things a love for the past and archaeology 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 43.36 54.09 <NA> and eventually when i started studying egyptology i realized that that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn 't enough because all of the sudden in egypt 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 53.63 54.97 <NA> my beach
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 55.4 57.58 <NA> had grown from a tiny beach in maine
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 57.41 65.56 <NA> to one eight hundred miles long next to the nile and my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities <unk> 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 66 73.57 <NA> this is really what brought me to using satellite imagery for trying to map the past i knew that i had to see differently 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 73.41 79.97 <NA> so i want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared this is a site located
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 80.02 88.37 <NA> <unk> in the eastern egyptian delta called mendes <unk> and the site visibly appears brown <unk> but when we use the infrared
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 87.91 94.44 <NA> and we process it all of the sudden using false color the site appears as bright pink <unk> 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 94.44 99.42 <NA> what you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 99.26 104.13 <NA> caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient egyptians
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 105.35 107.4 <NA> <unk> what i want to share with you today
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 107.06 110.08 <NA> is how we 've used satellite data
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 109.84 116.64 <NA> to find an ancient egyptian city called itjtawy <unk> missing for thousands of years 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 116.21 125.14 <NA> itjtawy was ancient egypt 's capital for over four hundred years at a period of time called the middle kingdom <unk> about four thousand years ago
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 125.55 134.06 <NA> <unk> the site is located in the faiyum of egypt and the site is really important because in the middle kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient egyptian art <unk> 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 134.06 136.48 <NA> architecture and religion <unk> 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 136.29 146.26 <NA> egyptologists have always known the site of itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it indicated within the red circles here <unk>
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 146.21 153.25 <NA> <unk> but somewhere within this massive flood plain <unk> this area is huge it 's four miles by three miles in size
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 154.87 162.41 <NA> <unk> city of itjtawy <unk> and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east it covered over the city <unk> so 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 162.07 167 <NA> how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 166.87 169.95 <NA> finding it randomly would be the equivalent
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 169.47 173.9 <NA> of locating a needle in a haystack blindfolded wearing baseball mitts 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 174.31 180 <NA> so what we did is we used nasa topography data to map out the landscape very subtle
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 179.96 184.62 <NA> <unk> changes we started to be able to see where the nile used to flow 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 184.43 194.97 <NA> but you can see in more detail and even more interesting this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of itjtawy <unk> 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 194.78 197.97 <NA> so we collaborated with egyptian scientists
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 197.78 199.87 <NA> to do coring work which you see
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 200.4 206.77 <NA> <unk> when i say coring it 's like ice coring but instead of layers of climate change you 're looking for layers of human occupation 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 206.46 210.62 <NA> and five meters down <unk> underneath a thick layer of mud 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 210.41 220.75 <NA> we found a dense layer of pottery <unk> what this shows is that at this possible location of itjtawy five meters down <unk> we have a layer of occupation for several <unk>
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 220.65 226.1 <NA> <unk> hundred years dating to the middle kingdom dating to the exact period of time we think itjtawy is 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 230.16 240.38 <NA> and agate that shows that there was a jeweler 's workshop here <unk> these might not look like much <unk> but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the middle kingdom <unk> 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 240.46 253.11 <NA> these are the stones that were used so we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the middle kingdom at this site we also have evidence of an elite jeweler 's workshop showing that whatever was there was a very important city
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 254.87 258.64 <NA> <unk> here yet but we 're going to be returning to the site in the near future
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 258.46 269.01 <NA> to map it out and even more importantly <unk> we have funding to train young egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well 
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 269.09 277.99 <NA> so i wanted to end with my favorite quote from the middle kingdom it was probably written at the city of itjtawy four thousand years ago
SarahParcak_2012U 1 SarahParcak_2012U 279.78 287.72 <NA> <unk> knowledge is the greatest of all callings there 's nothing like it in the land so as it turns out <unk> ted was not founded in
