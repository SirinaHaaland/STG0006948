ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 220.73 229.97 <NA> another way that you can make words in english is by squishing two other english words together this is called compounding words in english are like lego if you use enough
ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 229.99 232.49 <NA> <unk> force you can put any two of them together 
ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 234.43 245.39 <NA> we do this all the time in english words like heartbroken bookworm sandcastle all are compounds so go ahead and make words like duckface just don 't make duckface 
ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 247.24 249.87 <NA> another way that you can make words in english is
ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 252.59 262.45 <NA> <unk> instead you use so much force when you squish the words together that some parts fall off so these are blend words like brunch is a blend of

ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 286.29 298.82 <NA> <unk> you can also make words by changing how they operate this is called functional shift you take a word that acts as one part of speech and you change it into another part of speech <unk> okay who here knew that friend hasn 't always been a verb
ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 305.22 308.57 <NA> it almost any word in english can be verbed 
ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 308.2 316.82 <NA> you can also take adjectives and make them into nouns commercial used to be an adjective and now it 's a noun and of course you can green things 
ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 316.87 319.28 <NA> another way to make words in english is <unk>
ErinMcKean_2014Y 1 ErinMcKean_2014Y 320.28 324.99 <NA> you can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit <unk> so for example in
