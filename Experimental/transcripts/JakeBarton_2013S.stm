JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 270.91 277.21 <NA> engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it 's from or manipulate the work itself

JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 282.78 290.44 <NA> or this individual piece here <unk> you can see the actual bedroom it really changes the way you think about this type of a tempera painting 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 290.91 304.94 <NA> this is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself this is rodin 's bust you get the sense of this incredible factory for creativity and it makes you think about literally the hundreds or thousands of years of human creativity and how each individual artwork stands in for part of that story
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 305.02 309.62 <NA> this is picasso of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 309.49 316.56 <NA> and so our next interface which i 'll show you actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity it 's an algorithm
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 316.4 328.74 <NA> that actually allows you to browse the actual museum 's collection using facial recognition so this person 's making different faces <unk> and it 's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she 's looking
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 329.96 332.83 <NA> <unk> and so you can imagine that as people are
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 332.59 341.55 <NA> performing inside of the museum itself <unk> you get this sense of this emotional connection this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 341.21 347.19 <NA> this is an interface that actually allows you to draw and then draws forth objects using those same shapes <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 347 355 <NA> so more and more we 're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves to be creative even as they 're looking at other people
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 355.02 357.97 <NA> <unk> 's creativity and understanding them so in this
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 357.77 362.92 <NA> wall the collections wall you can actually see all three thousand artworks all at the same time 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 362.58 368.12 <NA> and you can actually author your own individual walking tours of the museum so you can share them

JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 372.63 379.52 <NA> but all the while that we 've been working on this engagement for cleveland we 've also been working in the background on really our largest engagement to date
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 379.93 383.12 <NA> <unk> and that 's the nine eleven memorial and museum 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 382.84 390.81 <NA> so we started in two thousand and six as part of a team with thinc design to create the original master plan for the museum 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 390.81 399.78 <NA> and then we 've done all the media design both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production so the memorial opened in two thousand and eleven and the museum 's going to open next year in two thousand and
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 400.7 411.15 <NA> <unk> and you can see from these images the site is so raw and almost archaeological and of course the event itself is so recent somewhere between history and current events it was a huge challenge <unk>
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 411.05 417.13 <NA> <unk> to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this an event like this to actually tell that story <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 426 430.32 <NA> <unk> so it 's estimated that a third of the world watched nine eleven live 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 430.33 438.97 <NA> and a third of the world heard about it within twenty four hours making it really by nature of when it happened this unprecedented moment of global awareness <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 438.48 450.02 <NA> and so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world through video through photos through written history and so people 's experiences on that day which was in fact this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 451.42 461.3 <NA> <unk> but that was coupled together with this oral histories booth really the simplest we 've ever made where you locate yourself on a map it 's in six languages <unk> and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 461.3 469.58 <NA> and when we started seeing the incredible images and stories that came forth from all around the world this is obviously part of the landing gear
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 469.09 471.35 <NA> we really started to understand
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 471.35 479.79 <NA> that there was this amazing symmetry between the event itself between the way that people were telling the stories of the event and how we ourselves needed to tell that story
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 480.32 487.23 <NA> this image in particular really captured our attention at the time because it so much sums up that event this is a
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 487.23 490.72 <NA> shot from the brooklyn battery tunnel there 's a firefighter
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 490.48 499.71 <NA> that 's stuck actually in traffic and so the firefighters themselves are are running a mile and a half to the site itself with upwards of seventy pounds of gear on their back
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 500 507.31 <NA> we got this amazing email that said while viewing the thousands of photos on the site i unexpectedly found a photo of my son <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 507 510.28 <NA> it was a shock emotionally yet a blessing to find this photo 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 510.08 515.02 <NA> and he was writing because he said i 'd like to personally thank the photographer for posting the photo 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 515.02 521.86 <NA> as it meant more than words can describe to me to have access to what is probably the last photo ever taken of my son 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 522.96 529.97 <NA> and it really made us recognize what this institution needed to be in order to actually tell that story
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 530.16 531.98 <NA> can 't have
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 531.49 537.83 <NA> just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 537.46 544.22 <NA> when you have the witnesses to history who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 543.79 554.58 <NA> and so we started imagining the museum along with the creative team at the museum and the curators thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors and so we created
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 554.66 564.67 <NA> <unk> idea of an opening gallery called we remember and i 'll just play you part of a mockup of it but you get a sense of what it 's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history

JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 622.61 629.97 <NA> withstood the actual pressure from the hudson river for a full year after the event itself <unk> and so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 630.25 635.47 <NA> of presence of that moment into the actual exhibition itself and we tell the stories
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 635.29 645.57 <NA> of being inside the towers through that same audio collage so you 're hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building or making their way down the stairwells <unk> and <unk>
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 645.47 654.97 <NA> <unk> as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 655.1 658.45 <NA> who literally excavated on top of the pile itself
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 658.05 667.81 <NA> <unk> and so you can hear oral histories so people who were actually working the so called bucket brigades as you 're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 667.65 671.59 <NA> and as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about nine eleven 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 671.59 679.97 <NA> we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about nine eleven
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 679.93 691.43 <NA> <unk> and we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable the types of questions that nine eleven itself draws forth for all of us <unk> and so these are questions like how can a democracy balance freedom and security 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 691.45 693.51 <NA> how could nine eleven
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 693.32 700.23 <NA> have happened and how did the world change after nine eleven and so these oral histories which we 've actually been capturing

JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 701.41 712.05 <NA> are then mixed together with interviews that we 're doing with people like donald rumsfeld bill clinton rudy giuliani and you mix together these different players and these different experiences these different reflection <unk>

JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 781.02 793.44 <NA> and we actually got involved in the memorial after we 'd done the museum for a few years the original designer of the memorial michael arad had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated almost random 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 793.37 799.93 <NA> really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself but it was a huge challenge
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 800.04 806.98 <NA> <unk> the families for the foundation certainly for the first responders and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 806.98 819.73 <NA> to actually create not an order in terms of chronology or in terms of alphabetical but through what 's called meaningful adjacency so these are are groupings of the names themselves which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 819.39 829.51 <NA> and we along with jer thorp created an algorithm to take massive amounts of data to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves <unk> so this is an image
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 829.84 838.98 <NA> <unk> actual algorithm itself with the names scrambled for privacy but you can see that these blocks of color are actually the four different flights the two different towers <unk> 
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 838.98 846.21 <NA> the first responders and you can actually see within that different floors and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 846.03 854.97 <NA> that were requested by the families themselves <unk> and so when you go to the memorial <unk> you can actually see the overarching organization inside
JakeBarton_2013S 1 JakeBarton_2013S 854.93 865.14 <NA> <unk> of the individual pools themselves <unk> you can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial and you can search for an individual name or in this case an <unk>
