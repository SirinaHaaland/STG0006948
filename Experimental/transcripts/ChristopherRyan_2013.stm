ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 76.18 85.49 <NA> <unk> let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes <unk> despite what you may have heard we are apes we are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 85.32 93.5 <NA> than the african elephant is to the indian elephant as jared diamond pointed out in one of his early books we
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 93.43 99.33 <NA> 're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate

ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 114.2 118.38 <NA> what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality 
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 118.43 125.38 <NA> now since darwin 's day there 's been what cacilda and i have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution

ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 128.91 142.19 <NA> the idea is that as part of human nature from the beginning of our species ' time men have sort of leased women 's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services

ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 180.02 190.36 <NA> <unk> have been around for about two hundred thousand years so we 're talking about five percent at most of our time as a as a modern distinct species <unk> 
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 190.36 191.73 <NA> so
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 191.99 200.13 <NA> before agriculture before the agricultural revolution it 's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter gatherer groups
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 200.13 204.64 <NA> that are characterized wherever they 're found in the world
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 204.96 209.35 <NA> <unk> what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism

ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 219.63 228.98 <NA> <unk> fidelity it turns out are shared widely among these societies now i 'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages and i 'm not saying modern day
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 230.05 240.71 <NA> <unk> savages either what i 'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context and there 's really no argument about this among anthropologists <unk>
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 240.66 249.99 <NA> all cacilda and i have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality <unk> so we 've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 252.17 265.74 <NA> <unk> as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex flexible social systems networks that our ancestors were very good at and that 's why our species has survived so well
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 266.6 279.58 <NA> now this makes some people uncomfortable and so i always need to take a moment in these talks to say <unk> listen i 'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous but i 'm not saying they were having sex with strangers there were no strangers
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 280.07 290.26 <NA> in a hunter gatherer band there are no strangers you 've known these people your entire life so i 'm saying yes there were overlapping sexual relationships that our ancestors probably had several <unk>

ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 319.51 329.55 <NA> i 'm not criticizing this and i 'm not saying there 's anything wrong with this what i 'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 330.02 339.18 <NA> is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism 
ChristopherRyan_2013 1 ChristopherRyan_2013 339.32 346.62 <NA> you can choose to be a vegetarian but don 't think that just because you 've made that decision bacon suddenly stops smelling good <unk>
