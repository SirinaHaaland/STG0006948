CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 41.42 45.94 <NA> well the three big problems have in common
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 45.75 50.29 <NA> that they are man made problems but they are controlled by natural forces
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 51.66 57.71 <NA> <unk> this should make us feel very terribly awful as much as it should make us feel hopeful because
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 57.5 65.38 <NA> if we have the power to create these problems <unk> we may as well have the power to remediate these problems but what about natural forces <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 65.01 73.12 <NA> well that 's exactly what i want to talk about today is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man made problems <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 74.61 79.97 <NA> when the bp oil spill happened i was working at mit <unk> and i was in charge of developing
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 79.96 86.84 <NA> <unk> an oil spill cleaning technology <unk> and i had a chance to go in the gulf of mexico and meet some fishermen
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 86.41 94.83 <NA> and see the terrible conditions in which they were working more than seven hundred of these boats which are fishermen boats repurposed
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 94.65 102.98 <NA> with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange were used but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 102.49 104.94 <NA> and the health of the cleaners were
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 105.02 106.83 <NA> <unk> very deeply affected 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 107.3 114.28 <NA> i was working on a very interesting technology at mit but it was a very long term view of how to develop technology <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 114.28 117.18 <NA> and it was going to be a very expensive technology 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 116.75 125.14 <NA> and also it would be patented <unk> so i wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast that would be cheap
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 128.61 132.88 <NA> <unk> in the gulf of mexico <unk> and that would be using renewable energy <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 132.72 139.72 <NA> so i quit my dream job <unk> and i moved to new orleans <unk> and i kept on studying how the oil spill was happening 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 139.26 146.68 <NA> currently what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats <unk> and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 146.4 149.96 <NA> if you 're using the exact same amount of surface of
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 151.03 156.56 <NA> <unk> just paying attention to natural patterns and if you 're going up the winds you can collect a lot more material 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 156.37 166.86 <NA> if you 're multiplying the rig <unk> so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you 're using you can collect a lot more <unk> but it 's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent against the winds 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 166.86 179.37 <NA> the surface currents and the waves these are enormous forces <unk> so the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 180.26 181.31 <NA> <unk> so
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 181.03 186.88 <NA> this didn 't require any invention we just took a simple sailing boat and we tried to pull something long and heavy <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 186.88 194.59 <NA> but as we tacked back and forth what we lost was two things we were losing pulling power and direction <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 194.38 199.92 <NA> and so i thought <unk> what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 199.43 201.69 <NA> would we have better control <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 201.26 204.91 <NA> so i built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front and
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 204.9 207.4 <NA> <unk> was trying to pull something very long and heavy so that 's a <unk>
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 208.8 216.07 <NA> object just to pull <unk> and i was surprised with just a <unk> 14 centimeter rudder i could control four meters of absorbent 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 215.67 222.41 <NA> then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot <unk> and so you see the the robot has a
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 222.19 224.93 <NA> front rudder here normally it 's at the back 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 226.66 233.66 <NA> <unk> realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing <unk> and i could avoid an obstacle at the very last second more maneuverable than a normal boat 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 233.26 238.41 <NA> then i started publishing online and some friends from korea <unk> they started
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 237.96 244.77 <NA> being interested in this and we made a boat which has a front rudder and a back rudder <unk> so we started interacting with this 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 244.77 249.96 <NA> and it was slightly better although it was very small and a bit off balance but then we thought <unk> what
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 262.67 267.24 <NA> <unk> and that 's the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 267.24 274.96 <NA> and the properties of sailing that we get are very superior compared to a normal boat <unk> when we 're turning we have the feeling of
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 279.81 289.45 <NA> <unk> this is low speed <unk> low wind speed <unk> and the maneuverability is very increased <unk> and here i 'm going to do a small jibe <unk> and look at the position of the sail <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 288.99 298.15 <NA> what 's happening is that because the boat changes shape the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind we 're catching wind from both sides <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 298.15 300.05 <NA> and this is exactly what we 're looking
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 300.04 304.85 <NA> <unk> if we want to pull something long and heavy <unk> we don 't want to lose pulling power nor direction <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 304.66 316.62 <NA> so i wanted to know if this was possible to put this at an industrial level <unk> so we made a large boat with a large sail and with a very light hull inflatable very small footprint so we have a very big
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 316.44 322.56 <NA> size and power ratio <unk> after this we wanted to see if we could implement this
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 322.35 329.25 <NA> and automate the system so we used the same system but we added a structure to it so we could activate the machine <unk> so we used the same
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 329.92 333.66 <NA> bladder inflated system <unk> and we took it for testing <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 333.17 340.26 <NA> so this is happening in the netherlands <unk> we tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 339.92 343.15 <NA> and then we mounted a camera for controlling it <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 343.15 350.1 <NA> but quickly we saw that we would need a lot more weight at the bottom <unk> so we had to take it back to the lab
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 349.76 354.94 <NA> and then we built a skin around it we put batteries remote controllers <unk> and then we put
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 354.99 360.16 <NA> <unk> the water and then we we let it go in the water and see how well it would work so
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 359.79 364.3 <NA> let some rope out <unk> and hope it 's going to work <unk> and
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 363.9 373.15 <NA> it worked okay but we still have a long way our small prototype has given us good insight that it 's working very well <unk> but we still need to work a lot more on this <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 373.41 379.97 <NA> so what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology we went from a back rudder to a front rudder to
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 379.93 388.64 <NA> <unk> two rudders to multiple rudders to the whole boat changing shape <unk> and the more we are moving forward <unk> and the more the design looks simple and
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 388.69 394.46 <NA> cute but i wanted to show you a fish because
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 394.96 404.46 <NA> in fact it 's very different from a fish a fish will move because by by changing like this but our boat is propelled by the wind still
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 404.78 408.27 <NA> <unk> and the hull controls the trajectory <unk> so
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 407.87 415.68 <NA> i brought to you for the first time on the ted stage protei number eight <unk> it 's not the last one but it <unk> it 's a good one for making demos <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 415.22 419.11 <NA> so the first thing as i show you in the video is that we may be

CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 419.75 429.28 <NA> control the trajectory of a sailing boat better or we may be able to never be in irons so never facing the wind <unk> we always can catch the wind from both sides
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 429.96 433.13 <NA> <unk> but new properties of a sailing boat <unk> so
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 432.92 434.14 <NA> if you 're looking
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 433.94 443.59 <NA> at the boat from this side <unk> this might remind you of an airplane profile an airplane <unk> when you 're moving in this direction starts to lift <unk> and that 's how it takes off now
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 443.19 450.19 <NA> if you 're taking the same system <unk> and you 're putting vertical you 're bending <unk> and if you 're moving this this way forward <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 449.76 454.43 <NA> your instinct will tell you that you might go this way <unk> but if you 're moving fast enough
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 455.05 459.92 <NA> <unk> what we call lateral lift <unk> so we could get further or closer to the wind <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 460 467.9 <NA> other property is this a normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 467.47 474.99 <NA> and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat but because this doesn 't have either
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 476.84 482.28 <NA> <unk> we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 482 492.56 <NA> the other thing is most boats when they reach a certain speed <unk> and they are going on waves they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 492.56 504.04 <NA> but if we 're going with the flow <unk> if we pay attention to natural patterns instead of trying to be strong but if you 're going with the flow <unk> we may absorb a lot of environmental noises so the the wave energy 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 503.85 504.91 <NA> to actually
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 504.92 507.43 <NA> save some energy to move forward <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 508.38 514.75 <NA> so we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy <unk> but
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 515.43 524.72 <NA> the idea is what is the purpose of technology if it doesn 't reach the right hands <unk> normal technology or innovation happens like this somebody has an interesting
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 525.67 534.32 <NA> <unk> some other scientist or engineer they take it to the next level they make a theory about it and maybe they patent it and then some industry will make a contract of
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 533.92 541.7 <NA> exclusivity to manufacture and sell it and then eventually a buyer will buy it and we hope that they are going to use [ it ] for a good purpose 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 541.69 549.78 <NA> what we really want is that this innovation happens continuously the inventor and engineers and also the manufacturers and everybody works at the same
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 550.55 564.06 <NA> <unk> but this would be sterile if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process <unk> what you really want is not a sequential not parallel development you want to have a network of innovation you want everybody like we 're doing now to work at the same time <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 564.06 569.65 <NA> and that can only happen if these people all together decide to share the information <unk>

CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 580.17 586.33 <NA> so what is open hardware essentially open hardware is a license it 's just an intellectual property setup <unk> 
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 585.84 595.91 <NA> it means that everybody is free to use modify and distribute <unk> and in exchange we only ask for two things the name is credited the name of the project
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 595.72 604.94 <NA> and also the people who make improvement they share back with the community so it 's a very simple condition <unk> and i started this project alone in a garage in new orleans
CesarHarada_2012S 1 CesarHarada_2012S 604.93 614.12 <NA> <unk> but quickly after i wanted to publish and share this information so i made a kickstarter which is a crowd fundraising platform <unk> and in about one month we fundraised thirty thousand dollars
