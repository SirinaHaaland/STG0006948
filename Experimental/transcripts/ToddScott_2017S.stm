ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 12.97 23.15 <NA> <unk> got a chance to watch the new star wars movie which was fantastic <unk> but one thing kept bugging me i don 't know if you noticed this or not in this entirely technically advanced world i did not see a single
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 23.15 29.97 <NA> aed anywhere which was totally shocking almost as shocking as not knowing what an aed is which you guys do know but for those
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 30.02 38.64 <NA> <unk> at home an aed is an automated external defibrillator it 's the device you use when your heart goes into cardiac arrest to shock it back into a normal rhythm
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 38.99 42.12 <NA> <unk> or as one of the guys i was teaching a class to referred to it <unk>
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 43.34 49.9 <NA> <unk> thing but i really can 't blame the empire since health and safety regulations
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 53.37 60.13 <NA> <unk> even if we i think worse than not having an aed would be if there was one there but just no one knew where to find it 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 60.12 66.46 <NA> these devices can drastically increase your chance of survival almost like a tauntaun on hoth 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 66.51 73.09 <NA> laughter but i 'm pretty sure that that stormtrooper is going to be toast regardless if we have an aed or not 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 72.69 79.97 <NA> since what happens is the chest plate is going to be quite hard to get off and like that tauntaun the aed has a very short
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 80.05 86.6 <NA> <unk> window of time at which it 's highly effective in this case basically we 've got to use it within the first ten minutes 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 86.47 91.4 <NA> the jedi on the other hand have no problems with their outfits those robes open straight up 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 91.06 98.6 <NA> you can place the pads right onto the chest so upper right hand side of the chest lower left <unk> wait for the unit to
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 98.14 104.79 <NA> determine if it 's a shockable rhythm and get ready to shock <unk> but the jedi do have a problem they have a head appendage issue
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 105.05 112.89 <NA> <unk> and so i can be totally clear thinking i 'm ready to go but i 'm accidentally touching a tentacle and inadvertently shocking myself 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 113.36 117.4 <NA> so before you hit that button make sure
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 116.92 119.91 <NA> you are clear and everyone else is clear 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 119.87 121.77 <NA> going back
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 121.43 129.94 <NA> to that stormtrooper if i did get that chest plate off in time what would you do if you suddenly found there was a wookiee under there or possibly
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 132.54 139.91 <NA> well lucky for us in the kit there 's actually a razor and we can use that to shave the chest on the upper right hand side
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 139.67 141.76 <NA> and the lower left 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 142.2 149.96 <NA> wookiees also have another problem they have an accessory issue <unk> what we want to do is remove these anything between the two pads we
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 154.15 161.93 <NA> <unk> for those who don 't know what arcing is do you remember the emperor when he shoots electricity out the ends of his fingers that would be kind of like arcing <unk> 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 162.22 167.15 <NA> another thing that oh by the way he creates that by wearing wool socks under his robes 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 168.04 174.83 <NA> we can also get arcing if we have an extremely wet chest the electricity travels across the surface instead of through the heart 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 174.83 179.94 <NA> we can correct this with the immortal words of douglas adams don 't panic which most of us have done today
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 180.35 188.7 <NA> and also always having a towel so good words to go by the metal bikini unfortunately this is where panic sets in
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 188.39 193.81 <NA> like the modern bra we have to make sure we remove <unk> because this can cause severe
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 193.63 202.29 <NA> cause severe arcing along with burns <unk> but unfortunately this opens up an issue that 's almost as controversial as talking about the prequels 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 202.85 204.7 <NA> the mere mention of the word
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 205.11 210.16 <NA> <unk> and people get into a little bit of a tizzy <unk> by the way that is not a nipple that 's a cupcake 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 212.58 217.27 <NA> chances are if you do have to use this this is going to be on someone you know 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 216.81 221.11 <NA> and remember <unk> everyone has nipples <unk> except for jabba but
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 220.98 229.34 <NA> he does love cupcakes speaking about jabba <unk> if we do have to use an aed on him remember pad placement is the same even though he
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 230.29 233.41 <NA> so it 's going to be upper right hand side lower left
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 233.42 241.62 <NA> if we were going through we 're shocking getting ready to go after we 've done the shock one of the things we need to do is remember to do compression 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 241.38 245.3 <NA> the preferred method is thirty compressions and two breaths
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 244.99 254.43 <NA> in the center of the chest between the nipples <unk> pressing down at least two inches no more than two and a half at a rate of at least one hundred beats a minute
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 254.84 256.89 <NA> <unk> no more than one hundred and twenty <unk> 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 257.66 265.11 <NA> unfortunately due to the size of jabba 's mouth and also what he puts in said mouth we may not want to actually <unk>
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 264.95 275.04 <NA> do the mouth to mouth part so instead we can do compression only cpr the way of remembering the compression only part is we can actually use the imperial march
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 274.55 279.91 <NA> i would sing it for you unfortunately that would be more
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 279.84 281.98 <NA> <unk> something an interrogation droid would do
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 281.85 288.55 <NA> <unk> yoda <unk> small little guy like a baby what we do is basically treat him like a baby <unk> 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 288.27 294.58 <NA> in the sense that we 're going to place one pad in the center of the chest and one in the back if we place them both in the front <unk> 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 294.58 299.17 <NA> they can be too close and cause severe arcing so we want to avoid that <unk> 
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 298.71 300.08 <NA> hopefully this helped
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 300 307.4 <NA> <unk> to clarify and put some some light on some of the darker issues of using an aed in the star wars universe or any universe in total i 'll
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 306.94 316.43 <NA> leave you with one point remember if you do find yourself dealing with a wookiee do not shave the entire wookiee this takes way too much time and it only pisses them off laughter
ToddScott_2017S 1 ToddScott_2017S 316.45 317.7 <NA> thank you very much
