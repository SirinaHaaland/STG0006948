EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 12.88 21.5 <NA> <unk> has everybody heard of crispr i would be shocked if you hadn 't this is a technology it 's for genome editing
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 21.5 29.85 <NA> and it 's so versatile and so controversial that it 's sparking all sorts of really interesting conversations <unk> should we bring back the woolly
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 29.78 30.9 <NA> <unk> mammoth 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 30.74 36.63 <NA> should we edit a human embryo <unk> and my personal favorite 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 36.47 46.2 <NA> how can we justify wiping out an entire species that we consider harmful to humans off the face of the earth using this technology 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 46.64 54.94 <NA> this type of science is moving much faster than the regulatory mechanisms that govern it and so for the past six years
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 55.19 57.76 <NA> <unk> i 've made it my personal mission
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 57.3 65.52 <NA> to make sure that as many people as possible understand these types of technologies and their implications now crispr has been
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 65.36 73.9 <NA> the subject of a huge media hype <unk> and the words that are used most often are easy and cheap 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 73.83 79.61 <NA> so what i want to do is drill down a little bit deeper and look into some of the the myths and the
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 80.37 81.89 <NA> around <unk> crispr 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 82.42 88.52 <NA> if you 're trying to crispr a genome <unk> the first thing that you have to do is damage the dna
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 88.45 96.8 <NA> <unk> the damage comes in the form of a double strand break through the double helix <unk> and then the cellular repair processes kick in 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 96.55 104.7 <NA> and then we convince those repair processes to make the edit that we want and not a natural edit that 's how it works
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 105.41 113.32 <NA> it 's a two part system <unk> you 've got a cas9 protein and something called a guide rna i like to think of it as a guided missile <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 113.32 124.2 <NA> so the cas9 i love to anthropomorphize so the cas9 is kind of this pac man thing that wants to chew dna and the guide rna is the leash that 's keeping it
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 123.86 129.97 <NA> out of the genome until it finds the exact spot where it matches <unk> and the combination of
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 129.9 136.57 <NA> <unk> those two is called crispr it 's a system that we stole from an ancient ancient bacterial immune system <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 136.92 145.87 <NA> the part that 's amazing about it is that the guide rna only twenty letters of it are what target the system 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 146.04 149.78 <NA> this is really easy to design and it 's really cheap to
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 151.75 161.36 <NA> <unk> that 's the part that is modular in the system everything else stays the same <unk> this makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use <unk>
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 161.53 171.54 <NA> the guide rna and the cas9 protein complex together go bouncing along the genome <unk> and when they find a spot where the guide rna matches 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 171.54 176.54 <NA> then it inserts between the two strands of the double helix <unk> it rips them apart 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 176.17 179.43 <NA> that triggers the cas9 protein to cut
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 179.9 186.57 <NA> <unk> and all of a sudden <unk> you 've got a cell that 's in total panic because now it 's got a piece of dna that 's broken 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 186.47 190.69 <NA> what does it do it calls its first responders <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 190.45 198.43 <NA> there are two major repair pathways <unk> the first just takes the dna and shoves the two pieces back together 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 198.43 204.73 <NA> this isn 't a very efficient system <unk> because what happens is sometimes a base drops out or a base is added
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 204.93 207.37 <NA> <unk> it 's an ok way to maybe like <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 207.03 217.39 <NA> knock out a gene <unk> but it 's not the the way that we really want to do genome editing the second repair pathway is a lot more interesting in this repair pathway it takes <unk>
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 217.34 224.96 <NA> a homologous piece of dna and now mind you in a diploid organism like people we 've got one copy of our genome from our mom and
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 225 231.92 <NA> one from our dad so if one gets damaged it can use the other chromosome to repair it so that 's where this comes from 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 231.97 236.27 <NA> the repair is made <unk> and now the genome is safe again 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 236.08 246.08 <NA> the way that we can hijack this is we can feed it a false piece of dna a piece that has homology on both ends but is different in the middle <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 245.59 249.89 <NA> so now you can put whatever you want in the center and the cell gets fooled 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 249.61 254.82 <NA> so you can change a letter <unk> you can take letters out but most importantly you can
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 254.78 258.78 <NA> <unk> stuff new dna in kind of like a trojan horse
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 258.59 268.47 <NA> crispr is going to be amazing in terms of the number of different scientific advances that it 's going to catalyze <unk> the thing that 's special about it is this <unk>
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 268.37 273.61 <NA> <unk> modular targeting system i mean we 've been shoving dna into organisms for years right <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 275.49 282.55 <NA> <unk> we can actually put it exactly where we want it the thing is that there 's a lot of
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 282.3 287.57 <NA> talk about it being cheap and it being easy and
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 287.39 289.93 <NA> i run a community lab <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 289.71 299.36 <NA> i 'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like hey can i come to your open night and like maybe use crispr and engineer my genome
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 306.16 315.53 <NA> <unk> but i 've heard it 's cheap i 've heard it 's easy we 're going to explore that a little bit so how cheap is it yeah <unk> it is cheap in comparison 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 315.13 325.17 <NA> it 's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars and it cuts the time a lot too it can cut it from weeks
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 326.57 334.23 <NA> <unk> that 's great <unk> you still need a professional lab to do the work in you 're not going to do anything meaningful outside of a professional lab i mean
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 334.23 338.55 <NA> <unk> don 't listen to anyone who says you can do this sort of stuff on your kitchen table
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 339.83 349.72 <NA> it 's really not easy to do this kind of work not to mention there 's a patent battle going on so even if you do invent something the broad institute
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 352.29 357.01 <NA> <unk> are in this incredible patent battle it 's really fascinating to watch it happen 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 357.01 364.87 <NA> because they 're accusing each other of fraudulent claims and then they 've got people saying oh well i signed my notebook here or there 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 364.47 372.88 <NA> this isn 't going to be settled for years <unk> and when it is you can bet you 're going to pay someone a really hefty licensing fee in order to use this stuff 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 372.81 375.14 <NA> so is it really cheap
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 376.03 383.81 <NA> <unk> it 's cheap if you 're doing basic research and you 've got a lab how about easy let 's look at that claim <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 383.89 387.38 <NA> the devil is always in the details <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 387.34 399.45 <NA> we don 't really know that much about cells they 're still kind of black boxes <unk> for example <unk> we don 't know why some guide rnas work really well and some guide rnas don 't <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 399.45 404.91 <NA> we don 't know why some cells want to do one repair pathway and some cells would rather do the
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 404.84 405.9 <NA> <unk> other 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 405.74 417.96 <NA> and besides that there 's the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place in a petri dish that 's not that hard but if you 're trying to do it on a whole organism it gets really tricky 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 417.71 424.99 <NA> it 's ok if you use something like blood or bone marrow those are the targets of a lot of research now there was a great story of some
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 425 430.75 <NA> <unk> little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out editing it and putting it back with a
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 430.55 432.79 <NA> precursor of crispr 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 432.39 446.48 <NA> and this is a line of research that people are going to do <unk> but right now if you want to get into the whole body you 're probably going to have to use a virus so you take the virus you put the crispr into it you let the virus infect the cell <unk> but now you 've got this virus in there <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 446.48 450.05 <NA> and we don 't know what the long term effects of that are plus 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 451.63 457.85 <NA> <unk> very small percentage but they 're still there <unk> what 's going to happen over time with that 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 457.48 465.05 <NA> these are not trivial questions <unk> and there are scientists that are trying to solve them and they will eventually hopefully be solved <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 465.05 470.97 <NA> but it ain 't plug and play not by a long shot so is it really easy <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 470.74 475.05 <NA> well <unk> if you spend a few years working it out in your particular system
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 475.97 483.54 <NA> <unk> it is now the other thing is we don 't really know that much about how to make
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 483.17 485.69 <NA> a particular thing happen
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 485.53 493.74 <NA> by changing particular spots in the genome we 're a long way away from figuring out how to give a pig wings for example <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 493.82 498.63 <NA> or even an extra leg i 'd settle for an extra leg that would be kind of cool right <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 498.62 504.97 <NA> but what is happening is that crispr is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 504.96 514.24 <NA> <unk> do really really important work like making better models of diseases in animals for example or for taking
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 514.32 521.71 <NA> pathways that produce valuable chemicals and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 521.71 524.87 <NA> <unk> or even doing really basic research on what genes
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 525.94 528.77 <NA> <unk> this is the story of crispr we should be telling <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 528.77 538.8 <NA> and i don 't like it that the flashier aspects of it are drowning all of this out <unk> lots of scientists did a lot of work to make crispr happen <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 538.58 543.57 <NA> and what 's interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 543.18 550.77 <NA> by our society <unk> think about it <unk> we 've got an infrastructure that allows a certain percentage of people
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 550.77 554.22 <NA> to spend all their time doing research
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 554.9 558.72 <NA> <unk> that makes us all the inventors of crispr 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 558.47 565.65 <NA> and i would say that makes us all the shepherds of crispr we all have a responsibility <unk> 
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 565.22 574.89 <NA> so i would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies <unk> because really only in that way are we going to be able to guide
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 574.46 579.94 <NA> the development of these technologies the use of these technologies and make sure that in the
EllenJorgensen_2016T 1 EllenJorgensen_2016T 579.9 587.21 <NA> <unk> end it 's a positive outcome for both the planet and for us thanks
