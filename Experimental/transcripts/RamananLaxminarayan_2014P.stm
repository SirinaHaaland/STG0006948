RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 329.99 344.88 <NA> <unk> and typically in the case of energy there are two ways in which you can deal with the problem one is we can make better use of the oil that we have <unk> and that 's analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics and we can do this in a number of ways that we 'll talk about in a second 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 344.39 354.76 <NA> but the other option is the drill baby drill option which in the case of antibiotics is is to go find new antibiotics <unk> now <unk> these are not separate
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 355.08 366.11 <NA> <unk> they 're related because if we invest heavily in new oil wells <unk> we reduce the incentives for conservation of oil in the same way that 's going to happen for antibiotics <unk>

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 381.99 384.58 <NA> this is really a game that we 're playing 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 384.59 397.55 <NA> the game is really one of coevolution and coevolution is in this particular picture between cheetahs and gazelles cheetahs have evolved to run faster because if they didn 't run faster <unk> they wouldn 't get any lunch <unk>

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 411.89 418.05 <NA> would just in the course of this little talk would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 426.39 437.8 <NA> <unk> we have drug discovery processes <unk> screening molecules we have clinical trials and then when we think we have a drug then we have the fda regulatory process <unk>

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 443.1 451.55 <NA> of the bacteria <unk> now this is clearly not a game that can be sustained or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead we 've got to slow the
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 451.55 454.97 <NA> pace of coevolution down <unk> and there are ideas
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 455.05 457.19 <NA> <unk> that we can borrow from energy
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 456.82 462.36 <NA> that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well <unk> 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 462.36 473.1 <NA> now <unk> if you think about how we deal with energy pricing for instance we consider emissions taxes <unk> which means we 're imposing the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 472.89 475.17 <NA> we might consider doing that for antibiotics
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 477.23 481.2 <NA> <unk> perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 481.19 488.88 <NA> there are clean energy subsidies which are to switch to fuels which don 't pollute as much or perhaps don 't need fossil fuels 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 488.88 498.06 <NA> now the analogy here is perhaps we need to move away from using antibiotics and if you think about it what are good substitutes for antibiotics <unk> 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 497.69 503.43 <NA> well <unk> turns out that anything that reduces the need for the antibiotic would really work <unk> so that could
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 503.06 504.82 <NA> include improving hospital

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 519.27 521.09 <NA> and that could really help 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 520.85 523.64 <NA> a third option might include something like tradeable permits
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 529.87 535.94 <NA> <unk> consider the fact that we might not have antibiotics for many people who have infections 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 535.94 541.7 <NA> we might consider the fact that we might want to allocate who actually gets to use some of these antibiotics
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 541.39 550.08 <NA> over others and some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need but also on the basis of pricing <unk> and certainly consumer education works very

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 566.11 573.48 <NA> <unk> and the same sort of example has been performed even in the case of antibiotics a hospital in st louis basically would put up on a chart

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 590.07 601.88 <NA> now <unk> there 's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well <unk> if you look at the price of penicillin <unk> the cost per day is about ten cents it 's a fairly cheap drug <unk> if you take drugs that have been introduced since then

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 615.52 621.81 <NA> but what is that really telling us that price is telling us that we should no longer

RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 629.96 636.83 <NA> <unk> that perhaps we need to be paying much more attention to conservation that price is also a signal
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 636.84 642.94 <NA> that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies in the same way that gasoline prices are a signal
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 642.58 647.1 <NA> and an impetus to say the development of electric cars 
RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 1 RamananLaxminarayan_2014P 646.91 652.93 <NA> prices are important signals and we need to pay attention but we also need to consider the fact that
