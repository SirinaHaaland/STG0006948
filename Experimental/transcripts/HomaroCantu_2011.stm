HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 16 24.78 <NA> <unk> and we 're chefs <unk> so when moto opened in two thousand and four people didn 't really know what to expect a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant and maybe it was the name
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 29.87 44.55 <NA> <unk> requests for japanese food which is really not what we did <unk> and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll <unk> we decided to give the people what they wanted <unk> so this picture is an example of printed food and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 44.55 51.78 <NA> so this is all the ingredients all the flavor of you know a standard maki roll printed onto a little piece of paper hc 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 51.74 54.73 <NA> so our diners started to get bored with this idea
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 55.05 58.66 <NA> <unk> and we decided to give them the same course twice <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 58.2 65.57 <NA> so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 65.36 73.47 <NA> so this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood the champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes a
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 73.47 77.48 <NA> little bit of seafood and some crme fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 79.98 87.54 <NA> 's not all just edible pictures <unk> we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 87.3 98.24 <NA> so in this case we have carrot cake <unk> so we take a carrot cake put it in a blender <unk> and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice <unk> and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen <unk>
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 98.19 103.95 <NA> to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream i guess <unk> and it comes off looking like
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 105.02 106.62 <NA> <unk> around your plate so yeah 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 106.34 111.16 <NA> we 're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for hc 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 110.92 113.95 <NA> and here 's something we have no reference to eat 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 113.74 119.45 <NA> this is a cigar <unk> and basically it 's a cuban cigar made out of a cuban pork sandwich <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 119.45 124.9 <NA> so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder <unk> we fashion that into
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 125.67 133.25 <NA> <unk> we take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green put an edible label that bears no similarity to a cohiba cigar label <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 133.25 137.53 <NA> and we put it in a dollar ninety nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it hc 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 138.66 140.53 <NA> delicious 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 140.58 148.28 <NA> br that 's not it though instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn 't eat <unk> we decided to make
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 148.12 154.49 <NA> ingredients look like dishes that you know <unk> so this is a plate of nachos the difference between our nachos and
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 154.96 157.4 <NA> <unk> other guy 's nachos is that this is actually a dessert <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 157.4 168.26 <NA> so the chips are candied the ground beef is made from chocolate and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 167.83 170.12 <NA> and after doing all of this <unk>
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 171.81 174.99 <NA> dematerialization and reconfiguring of this of
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 176.33 181.74 <NA> <unk> we realized that it was pretty cool because as we served it we learned that the dish actually behaves
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 181.46 189.81 <NA> like the real thing where the cheese begins to melt so when you 're looking at this thing in the dining room you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 189.44 194.4 <NA> and it 's not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert <unk> and it 's just kind of like a <unk>
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 199.37 204.91 <NA> so we had been creating all of these dishes out of a kitchen that was more like a mechanic 's
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 205.05 210.95 <NA> <unk> than a kitchen and the next logical step for us was to install a state of the art laboratory 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 210.95 217.54 <NA> and that 's what we have here so we put this in the basement and we got really serious about food like serious experimentation br 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 218.16 225.17 <NA> one of the really cool things about the lab besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen is that you know <unk> with this new equipment
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 228.1 240.35 <NA> <unk> all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open <unk> and so the the experiments and the the food and the dishes that we created <unk> they just kept going further and further out there hc 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 240.35 244.7 <NA> let 's talk about flavor transformation <unk> and let 's actually make some cool stuff 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 244.33 251.01 <NA> you see a cow with its tongue hanging out what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious what is that cow eating 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 251.01 254.97 <NA> and why is it delicious <unk> so the cow basically eats
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 254.96 259.67 <NA> <unk> three basic things in their feed <unk> corn <unk> beets <unk> and barley <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 259.68 269.82 <NA> and so what i do is i actually challenge my staff with these crazy wild ideas can we take what the cow eats remove the cow and then make some hamburgers out of that 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 269.33 270.58 <NA> and
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 270.41 274.2 <NA> basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this br 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 275.82 282.49 <NA> <unk> 's our chef de cuisine chris jones this is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task <unk> but
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 282.18 290.26 <NA> a lot of these ideas <unk> they 're hard to understand <unk> they 're hard to just get automatically there 's a lot of research and
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 289.98 299.29 <NA> a lot of failure <unk> trial and error i guess more error that goes into each and every dish so we don 't always get it right and it it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people hc 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 299.19 304.88 <NA> so after about a day of chris and i staring at each other we
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 304.81 308.51 <NA> <unk> came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 308.31 315.92 <NA> and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat this is made from three ingredients <unk> beets <unk> barley <unk> corn <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 315.91 322.59 <NA> and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat <unk> looks and tastes like hamburger meat <unk> and not only that but
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 322.37 329.55 <NA> it 's basically removing the cow from the equation so replicating food taking it into that next level is where we 're going
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 332.36 336.33 <NA> and it 's definitely the world 's first bleeding veggie burger
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 335.93 346.38 <NA> <unk> which is a cool side effect <unk> and a miracle berry if you 're not familiar with it is a natural ingredient <unk> and it contains a special property it 's a glycoprotein called miraculin a
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 346.37 354.85 <NA> naturally occurring thing it still freaks me out every time i eat it but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 354.86 356.74 <NA> so that
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 356.46 361.75 <NA> primarily sour taste receptors so normally things that would taste very sour or tart <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 361.26 375.02 <NA> somehow begin to taste very sweet hc you 're about to eat a lemon and now it tastes like lemonade <unk> let 's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that we could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 375.02 377.02 <NA> and we can replace it with
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 376.98 379.97 <NA> all natural fresh fruit br so you see us
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 379.96 384.83 <NA> <unk> here cutting up some watermelon the idea with this is that we 're going to eliminate
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 384.52 393.56 <NA> tons of food miles <unk> wasted energy and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna or any exotic
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 393.56 395.54 <NA> produce or
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 395.05 399.96 <NA> or item from a very far away place with local organic produce <unk> so we have a
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 402.29 416.58 <NA> <unk> so if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon <unk> and it makes it go from sweet to savory <unk> so after we do that we put it into a vacuum bag <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 416.58 425.02 <NA> add a little bit of seaweed some spices and we roll it and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna <unk> so the key now is to make it
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 426.96 431.74 <NA> <unk> and then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 431.64 436.93 <NA> we really have something that looks tastes and behaves like like the real thing hc 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 437.16 446.86 <NA> so the key thing to remember here is we don 't really care what this tuna really is as long as it 's good for you and good for the environment it doesn 't matter <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 446.86 454.97 <NA> but where is this going how can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 455.01 458.48 <NA> that could be a disruptive food technology <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 458.44 468.98 <NA> so here 's the next challenge i told the staff let 's just take a bunch of wild plants think of them as food ingredients <unk> as long as they 're non poisonous to the human body go out around chicago <unk>
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 468.88 478.44 <NA> <unk> sidewalks take it <unk> blend it cook it and then have everybody flavor trip on it at moto let 's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 481.42 482.64 <NA> so you can imagine 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 482.64 491.79 <NA> a task like this this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for but we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general <unk> 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 491.3 499.69 <NA> because these are ingredients you know plant life that we 're one unfamiliar with and two we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don 't eat them <unk>
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 500.34 509.68 <NA> <unk> so we really had to think about new creative ways to flavor new ways to cook and to change change texture and that was the main issue with this challenge hc 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 509.49 512.02 <NA> so this is where we step
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 511.65 513.76 <NA> into the future
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 513.33 520 <NA> and we leapfrog ahead so developing nations and first world nations <unk> imagine if you could take
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 519.99 525.17 <NA> these wild plants and consume them food miles would basically turn into food feet
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 525.46 538.77 <NA> <unk> this disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are even if we just swapped out say one of these for flour that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 539.37 545.82 <NA> to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers there 's a bale of hay there and some crab apples 
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 545.82 549.93 <NA> and basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue
HomaroCantu_2011 1 HomaroCantu_2011 550 555.52 <NA> sauce out of those two ingredients people swore they were eating barbecue sauce <unk> and this is free food
