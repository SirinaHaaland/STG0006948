ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 17.62 23.85 <NA> over the last three years <unk> we found over two hundred of these things and so we looked back into our library
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 23.66 27.23 <NA> and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 28.81 29.91 <NA> of these
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 29.78 36.3 <NA> <unk> six the first one that we 're going to talk about is in the black envelope you 're holding it comes from a company
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 35.9 39.54 <NA> in japan called geltech now go ahead and open it up keith schacht now
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 44.03 46.8 <NA> be sure and take the two pieces apart 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 47.87 53.14 <NA> what 's unexpected about this is that it 's soft <unk> but it 's also a strong magnet
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 55.38 59.86 <NA> <unk> zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 59.37 62.33 <NA> we spent a long time thinking about why this is and
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 62.33 69.55 <NA> it 's just recently that we realized <unk> it 's when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 69.6 79.31 <NA> as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 80.53 87.81 <NA> now <unk> it 's important to understand what the unexpected properties are but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible <unk> 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 87.81 91.16 <NA> we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 91.51 99.26 <NA> so a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors <unk> if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 99.37 104.94 <NA> if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn 't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 105.11 107.46 <NA> imagine taking the same material <unk> 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 107.23 109.72 <NA> but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker you know
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 109.72 117.72 <NA> this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet <unk> and you could literally stick
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 117.29 123.69 <NA> your shoes up instead of using a shelf for me <unk> i really love this idea if
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 125.42 128.62 <NA> you come to my apartment and see my closet i 'm sure you 'd figure out why
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 129.96 133.1 <NA> <unk> the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 132.92 140.86 <NA> it helps you see why this is significant what the potential is but we 've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference zk 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 141.36 150.02 <NA> it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in l a and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola he works on mostly music videos
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 150 153.11 <NA> <unk> and commercials with his company the directors bureau
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 152.74 162.02 <NA> as we were talking roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you 're holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 161.77 165.18 <NA> and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 164.82 170.72 <NA> and he whips out this manila folder he opens it up <unk> and keith and i look in 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 170.38 177.39 <NA> and he starts showing us concepts that he 's been working on these things just get him really excited and so we 're looking at these concepts
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 180.02 181.23 <NA> <unk> were just like 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 180.95 190.42 <NA> whoa this guy 's good because the way that he presented the concept his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 190.09 192.45 <NA> as if it was for sale right now <unk> 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 192.92 199.44 <NA> when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking why was this so powerful 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 199.61 204.97 <NA> and as we thought about it more we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 205.25 214.21 <NA> just as if you saw it on tv so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 213.9 217.46 <NA> to create a commercial for a product a product from the future
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 249.67 254.94 <NA> <unk> we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when 's it coming out so i just wanted to let you know
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 254.96 257.7 <NA> <unk> 's not actually coming out just the concept is zk 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 258.08 264.06 <NA> so now when we dream up these concepts it 's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint <unk> 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 263.72 266.46 <NA> so i just want to quickly explain how this would work 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 266.09 272.97 <NA> this is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial the gel that you 're holding would be lining the bottom of the board 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 272.51 279.85 <NA> now this is important for two reasons one <unk> the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that if it were to hit the rider in the head it wouldn 't injure him in addition
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 279.99 292.67 <NA> <unk> see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you 're going down <unk> the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market <unk> 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 292.67 295.42 <NA> it 's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 295.08 298.09 <NA> when you get to the very bottom of the slide
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 301.18 309.8 <NA> <unk> kick it to keith to explain why that 's important from a technical standpoint ks so i 'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal <unk> it 's not a magnetic material <unk> 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 309.61 316.02 <NA> but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 334.7 337.02 <NA> <unk> you see the magnet fell really slowly 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 336.59 338.85 <NA> now i 'm not going to get into the physics of it 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 338.85 347.52 <NA> but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling <unk> the greater the stopping force zk now <unk> our next technology is actually a 10 foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 358.62 361.24 <NA> <unk> some of them automatically unroll like this one 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 360.78 367.45 <NA> they can be made to automatically roll up or they can be made stable like zach 's to hold any position in between zk
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 370.59 374.99 <NA> as we were talking to the vendor to try to learn about how you could apply

ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 377.02 379.29 <NA> he was telling us that in the military
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 379.08 388.4 <NA> they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their on their chests very concealed and then when they 're out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 388.96 395.9 <NA> in our brainstorms <unk> we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 397.36 400.05 <NA> ks now the interesting thing about this is
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 400.16 405.21 <NA> <unk> have to be an engineer to appreciate why a <unk> 10 foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 407.24 415.59 <NA> laughter so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this man i clean my ceiling fans with that and
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 415.16 418.32 <NA> i get the spider webs off my house i do it that way woman i
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 417.98 423.94 <NA> 'd make my very own walking stick woman i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree

ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 505.02 514.03 <NA> <unk> to the audience the temperature of your shirt go ahead sj it 's cold ks now the reason it 's cold is that 's it 's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 513.6 520.15 <NA> it 's a dry liquid developed by 3m it 's perfectly clear <unk> it 's odorless it 's colorless <unk> 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 519.78 523.15 <NA> it 's so safe you could drink this stuff

ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 547.27 554.67 <NA> what 's the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 555.02 567.9 <NA> now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we 'd damage the electronics that we 'd get him wet that we 'd hurt the books or the computers 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 567.59 579.88 <NA> it works because it 's non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn 't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away <unk> but today it 's most widely used in office buildings in the sprinkler system as
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 579.98 584.54 <NA> <unk> a fire suppression fluid again it 's perfectly safe for people it puts out the fires doesn 't hurt anything <unk> 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 584.3 588 <NA> but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 588.01 594.22 <NA> so during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry wouldn 't hurt the court zk 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 594.24 603.25 <NA> our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical one of their r <unk> & d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer <unk>

ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 632.78 641.07 <NA> <unk> so you see there it didn 't bounce back now this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing <unk> it 's technically called shape retaining property 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 640.76 643.87 <NA> now think about your interactions with aluminum foil
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 645.2 653.41 <NA> <unk> is common in metal <unk> you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 654.96 664.48 <NA> <unk> for example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist <unk> but doesn 't use a buckle taking it a little further if you wove those strips together
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 664.17 667.84 <NA> kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retaining sheet 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 667.41 674.56 <NA> and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it wouldn 't blow away 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 674.4 679.31 <NA> for our next technology it 's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself because it 's an ink
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 679.93 683.09 <NA> <unk> so we 've prepared a video to show it applied to paper ks 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 686.65 690.84 <NA> as this paper is bending <unk> the resistance of the ink changes 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 690.84 695.33 <NA> so with simple electronics <unk> you can detect how much the page is being bent 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 694.84 700.08 <NA> now to think about the potential for this think of all the places ink is supplied on business
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 700.55 706.17 <NA> <unk> on the back of cereal boxes board games any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it zk 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 706.01 712.68 <NA> so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book this could totally change the way that you interface with paper 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 712.4 720.9 <NA> you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page you 're on based on the curvature of the pages 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 721.16 728.8 <NA> in addition if you were to fold in one of the corners <unk> then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 729.99 736.19 <NA> <unk> for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 758.32 767.15 <NA> <unk> to smell like you narrator fresh watch from inventables dairy farms <unk> packaging that changes color when your milk 's gone off don 't let milk spoil your morning zk 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 767.92 775.02 <NA> now this technology was developed by these two guys professor ken suslick and neil rakow of the university of illinois ks now the way it works
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 775.28 777.22 <NA> <unk> there 's a matrix of color dyes 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 777.22 791.17 <NA> and these dyes change color in response to odors so the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow <unk> this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 790.95 797.61 <NA> but like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor zk 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 797.15 804.88 <NA> right it was that that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible beyond
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 805.02 808.72 <NA> <unk> detecting spoiled food it 's really where the significance of it lies 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 808.59 818.47 <NA> his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 817.98 827.12 <NA> he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is they would rush to the scene of the crime they would look around if there were no dead policemen it was ok to go
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 830.71 834.23 <NA> <unk> i mean this is a true story they 're using policemen as canaries 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 835.24 843.11 <NA> but more seriously they determined that you could develop a device that can can smell better than the humans <unk> and say if it 's safe for the firemen 
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 843.94 849.99 <NA> in addition he 's spun off a company from the university called chemsensing where they 're working on medical equipment

ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 879.93 886.72 <NA> <unk> changed our understanding of what was possible in the world <unk> prior to seeing this we would have assumed a 10 foot pole couldn 't fit in your pocket
ZachKaplan_2005 1 ZachKaplan_2005 886.23 893.08 <NA> something as inexpensive as ink couldn 't sense the way paper is being bent <unk> every one of these things and we 're constantly trying to find more zk
