EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 14.2 20.75 <NA> <unk> i think as a grumpy eastern european <unk> i was brought in to play the pessimist this morning <unk> so bear with me 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 20.53 24.93 <NA> well i come from the former soviet republic of belarus <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 25.46 30.81 <NA> <unk> as some of you may know is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 30.95 40.26 <NA> <unk> so that 's why i 've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 39.98 52.74 <NA> so i 'm graduating college and feeling very idealistic <unk> i decided to join the ngo which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former soviet union however
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 53.06 54.91 <NA> to my surprise
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 54.89 58.9 <NA> i discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 59.04 66.13 <NA> in fact some of them actually survived the internet challenge and some got even more repressive
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 66 74.9 <NA> <unk> so this is when i ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my ngo job and actually study how the internet could impede
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 76.9 81.5 <NA> <unk> i must tell you that this was never a very popular argument and
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 81.28 91.08 <NA> it 's probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience it was never popular with many political leaders especially those in the united states
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 91.03 96.75 <NA> <unk> who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn 't 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 104.9 111.93 <NA> <unk> by two thousand and nine this news has finally reached britain <unk> so i should probably add gordon brown to this list as well
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 112.07 116.11 <NA> <unk> however there is an underlying argument
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 115.89 124.9 <NA> about logistics which has driven so much of this debate right so if you look at it close enough you 'll actually see that much of this is
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 126.81 132.97 <NA> <unk> the cybertopians say much like fax machines and xerox machines did in the ' 80s 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 132.66 141.16 <NA> blogs and social networks have radically transformed the economics of protest <unk> so people would inevitably rebel
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 141.09 150.29 <NA> <unk> to put it very simply the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity <unk> if you give them enough devices
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 155.47 162.98 <NA> <unk> i never really bought into this argument in part because i never saw three american presidents agree on anything else in the past 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 166.54 174.05 <NA> but you know even beyond that if you think about the logic underlying it is something i call ipod liberalism
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 173.77 179.97 <NA> where we assume that every single iranian or chinese who happens to have and love his ipod
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 180.19 182.97 <NA> will also love liberal democracy 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 183.47 187.76 <NA> and again <unk> i think this is kind of false <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 187.77 200.28 <NA> but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic that we should be dropping ipods not bombs i mean it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman 's new book 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 200.66 203.44 <NA> but this is rarely a good sign
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 205.32 211.72 <NA> <unk> so the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 211.55 214.72 <NA> versus the actual uses of technology 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 214.59 221.95 <NA> for those of you who think that new media of the internet could somehow help us avert genocide 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 221.49 229.91 <NA> should look no further than rwanda where in the ' 90s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 229.84 238.11 <NA> <unk> first place <unk> but even beyond that coming back to the internet what you can actually see is that certain governments
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 237.93 245.45 <NA> have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes <unk> right <unk> and they are building what i call the spinternet 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 245.14 249.62 <NA> the combination of spin on the one hand and the internet on the other
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 249.25 254.94 <NA> so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hiring training
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 254.93 264.84 <NA> <unk> and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues <unk> right <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 264.84 270.67 <NA> so you may wonder why on earth are they doing it why are they engaging with cyberspace <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 270.46 275.2 <NA> well my theory is that it 's happening because censorship actually
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 275.16 280.63 <NA> <unk> is less effective than you think it is in many of those places the moment you put something critical <unk>
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 281.99 295.46 <NA> even if you manage to ban it immediately it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs <unk> <unk> so the more you block it the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 295.46 299.81 <NA> win in this cat and mouse game <unk> <unk> so the only way to
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 300 308.45 <NA> control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being for example a cia agent <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 308.29 315.32 <NA> and again this is happening quite often just to give you an example of how it works in china for example there
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 315.13 319.07 <NA> was a big case in february two thousand and nine
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 319.27 326.04 <NA> called elude the cat and for those of you who didn 't know i 'll just give a little summary <unk> so what happened is that
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 329.9 333.75 <NA> <unk> prison custody <unk> and police said that it happened
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 333.26 340.48 <NA> because he was playing hide and seek which is elude the cat in chinese slang with other inmates
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 340.3 343.08 <NA> and hit his head against the wall
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 343.82 349.35 <NA> <unk> which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese bloggers
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 349.49 354.46 <NA> <unk> so they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments in fact
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 354.95 362.47 <NA> qq com which is a popular chinese website <unk> had <unk> thirty five thousand comments on this issue within hours <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 362.19 365.47 <NA> but then authorities did something very smart 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 364.98 375.08 <NA> instead of trying to purge these comments they instead went and reached out to the bloggers <unk> and they basically said look guys we 'd like you to become netizen
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 376.9 383.48 <NA> <unk> so five hundred people applied <unk> and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 383.02 390.12 <NA> <unk> and thus inspect it and then blog about it <unk> within days the entire incident was forgotten 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 390.12 396.29 <NA> which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content people would keep talking about it for weeks
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 395.92 404.79 <NA> <unk> and this actually fits with another interesting theory about what 's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 405.16 408.14 <NA> this is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 408.14 415.77 <NA> and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 415.34 423.12 <NA> <unk> we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships but in many cases it only strengthens them
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 422.69 428.02 <NA> <unk> and you may wonder why i 'll just give you a very short list of reasons
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 427.86 429.97 <NA> why authoritarian deliberation may
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 429.9 437.38 <NA> <unk> actually help the dictators <unk> and first it 's quite simple most of them operate in a complete information vacuum
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 436.95 443.47 <NA> <unk> they don 't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 443.07 449.99 <NA> so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 450.94 453.93 <NA> <unk> low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 453.69 461.18 <NA> concealing what 's actually happening in the country <unk> right <unk> so from this perspective <unk> having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 460.81 465.03 <NA> secondly involving public in any decision making
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 464.64 469.7 <NA> is also great because it helps you to share the blame for the policies which eventually fail 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 469.7 475.02 <NA> because they say well look we asked you we consulted you you voted on it you put it on the front
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 479.48 480.72 <NA> <unk> and finally 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 480.59 487.77 <NA> the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes <unk> both at home and abroad <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 487.77 494.1 <NA> so inviting people to all sorts of public forums having them participate in decision making <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 494.06 499.87 <NA> it 's actually great because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say well we are
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 502.35 507.52 <NA> <unk> just to give you an example one of the russian regions for example <unk> now involves its citizens
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 507.35 508.35 <NA> in
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 508.13 512.01 <NA> planning its strategy up until year two thousand and twenty <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 511.79 517.91 <NA> right <unk> so they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year two thousand and twenty i
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 517.91 524.87 <NA> mean anyone who has been to russia would know that there was no planning in russia for the next month <unk> so having people involved in
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 526.15 531.86 <NA> <unk> is not necessarily going to change anything because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 532.17 537.47 <NA> just to give you an example from iran we all heard about the twitter revolution that happened there
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 537.47 549 <NA> <unk> but if you look close enough you 'll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and twitter and facebook were actually operational <unk> <unk> they may have become slower <unk> but the activists could still access it
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 548.84 554.46 <NA> and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states and
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 555.04 556.59 <NA> simply because
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 556.76 560.52 <NA> they can gather open source intelligence <unk>
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 560.27 567.21 <NA> <unk> in the past it would take you weeks <unk> if not months to identify how iranian activists connect to each other 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 566.78 577.75 <NA> now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their facebook page i mean kgb and not just kgb used to torture in order to actually get this data now it 's all available online
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 579.99 582.83 <NA> <unk> i think the biggest conceptual pitfall that
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 582.65 587.39 <NA> cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives people who have grown up online <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 587.39 599.96 <NA> we often hear about cyber activism how people are getting more active because of the internet rarely hear about cyber hedonism for example <unk> how people are becoming passive why because they somehow assume that the internet is going to be
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 600 612.8 <NA> catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography that 's not an option being considered too strongly <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 612.43 620.9 <NA> so for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of tehran there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the world of warcraft <unk> 
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 620.9 629.91 <NA> and this is realistic <unk> and there is nothing wrong about it because the internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them if you
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 629.87 644.92 <NA> <unk> look at some of the surveys on how the young people actually benefit from the internet you 'll see that the number of teenagers in china for example for whom the internet actually broadens their sex life is three times more than in the united states <unk> so it does play a social role
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 644.92 648.49 <NA> <unk> however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 648.3 654.85 <NA> so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber needs in space a total rip off from abraham maslow <unk> but the point
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 655.02 668.75 <NA> <unk> is that when we get the remote russian village online what will get people to the internet is not going to be the reports from human rights watch it 's going to be pornography sex and the city or maybe watching funny videos of cats
EvgenyMorozov_2009G 1 EvgenyMorozov_2009G 668.75 670.94 <NA> <unk> so this is something you have to recognize
