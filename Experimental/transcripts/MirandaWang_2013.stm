MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 25 28.02 <NA> can be but are they always that bad
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 27.71 34.29 <NA> the discovery that had led to penicillin for example is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 33.92 43.53 <NA> without biologist alexander fleming 's moldy accident caused by a neglected workstation we wouldn 't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections jeanny yao
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 44.15 49.72 <NA> miranda and i are here today because we 'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 51.75 57.82 <NA> <unk> we visited the vancouver waste transfer station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 57.33 63.29 <NA> we realized that when plastics get to the dump it 's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 63.11 70.81 <NA> and when they 're mixed with organic matter and construction debris it 's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them mw
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 70.59 78.61 <NA> however plastics are useful because they 're durable flexible and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 78.24 79.94 <NA> the downside of this
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 79.87 83.21 <NA> <unk> convenience is that there 's a high cost to this
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 82.72 91.91 <NA> plastics cause serious problems such as the destruction of ecosystems the pollution of natural resources and the reduction of available land space
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 91.6 94.71 <NA> this picture you see here is the great pacific gyre when
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 94.71 103.29 <NA> you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment we think about the great pacific gyre which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 103.08 104.76 <NA> but that 's no longer an accurate
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 104.72 108.45 <NA> <unk> depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 107.96 117.48 <NA> right now the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris and there 's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn 't be able to find plastic particles jy
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 117.53 126.21 <NA> in a plastic dependent society cutting down production is a good goal but it 's not enough and what about the waste that 's already been produced
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 125.9 129.97 <NA> plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 130.04 137.74 <NA> so we thought you know what instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up let 's find a way to break them down
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 137.31 141.37 <NA> with bacteria sounds cool right audience yeah jy thank you but
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 142.56 149.87 <NA> we had a problem you see plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 150.28 159 <NA> <unk> we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go mw with this idea in mind jeanny and i read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the internet
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 158.79 163.14 <NA> and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade twelve year
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 163.14 169.85 <NA> we aimed to find bacteria from our local fraser river that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 169.75 179.58 <NA> phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility durability and transparency although they 're part of the plastic they 're not
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 180.11 189.6 <NA> <unk> bonded to the plastic backbone as a result they easily escape into our environment not only do phthalates pollute our environment but they also pollute our bodies
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 189.17 196.32 <NA> to make the matter worse phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure such as babies toys
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 196.25 204.94 <NA> beverage containers cosmetics and even food wraps phthalates are horrible because they 're so easily taken into our bodies they
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 204.9 208.93 <NA> <unk> can be absorbed by skin contact ingested and inhaled jy
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 208.59 218.83 <NA> every year at least four hundred and seventy million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air water and soil the environmental protection agency even classified <unk>
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 218.73 226.3 <NA> <unk> this group as a top priority pollutant because it 's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 229.99 233.19 <NA> <unk> concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 232.95 243.35 <NA> so we figured if there are places along our fraser river that are contaminated with phthalates and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas then perhaps
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 243.12 247.7 <NA> perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates mw
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 247.6 253.62 <NA> so we presented this good idea to dr lindsay eltis at the university of british columbia and
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 253.45 255 <NA> surprisingly he actually
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 255.16 260.16 <NA> took us into his lab and asked his graduate students adam and james to help us
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 260.39 263.19 <NA> little did we know at that time that
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 262.7 273.09 <NA> a trip to the dump and some research on the internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life changing journey of accidents and discoveries jy
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 273.14 275.29 <NA> the first step in our project
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 275.31 279.17 <NA> <unk> was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the fraser river
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 278.96 283.4 <NA> out of thousands of bacteria we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 283.4 292.36 <NA> so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source this implied that if anything grew in our cultures then they must be able to live off of phthalates
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 292.2 297.19 <NA> everything went well from there and we became amazing scientists laughter mw um uh jeanny
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 298.14 302.86 <NA> jy i 'm just joking mw okay well it was partially my fault
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 302.49 303.59 <NA> you see i
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 305.05 317.36 <NA> <unk> cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture and as a result we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice and this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 316.93 324.81 <NA> but this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous we noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 325 336.72 <NA> contamination levels so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels jy
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 337.13 344.29 <NA> now that we grew the bacteria we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates because we thought that would be
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 344.11 348.06 <NA> less accident prone but we were wrong again
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 348.11 354.85 <NA> we poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi as a result we had to streak and
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 354.81 356.65 <NA> <unk> restreak several times
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 356.34 368.5 <NA> then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth and found that they shared an inverse correlation so as bacterial populations increased phthalate concentrations decreased
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 368.04 372.07 <NA> this means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates mw
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 372.06 379.94 <NA> so now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates we wondered what these bacteria were so jeanny and i took three of our most efficient
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 379.9 386.19 <NA> <unk> strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 385.95 398.24 <NA> we were happy to see that although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation so this was actually a novel discovery jy
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 398.86 405 <NA> to better understand how this biodegradation works we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 405.14 412.59 <NA> <unk> of our three strains to do this we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid mw
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 412.55 418.15 <NA> we monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 417.67 423.24 <NA> this graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 423.24 429.97 <NA> our bacteria can transform phthalates which is a harmful toxin into end products such as carbon dioxide water and alcohol
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 430.04 435.25 <NA> i know some of you in the crowd are thinking well carbon dioxide is horrible it 's a greenhouse gas
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 434.91 446.26 <NA> but if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates they would have used some other kind of carbon source and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 446.34 454.91 <NA> we were also interested to see that although we 've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site we obtained the
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 454.84 461.93 <NA> <unk> most efficient degraders from the landfill site so this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection jy
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 462.4 470.9 <NA> so miranda and i shared this research at the sanofi biogeneius challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 470.62 479.85 <NA> although we 're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 479.78 480.83 <NA> <unk> problem
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 480.67 493.23 <NA> we have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 492.95 501.93 <NA> throughout this journey we have also discovered our passion for science and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 501.47 504.79 <NA> we hope that in the near future we 'll be able to create
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 504.78 516.16 <NA> <unk> model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants we can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 516.15 518.23 <NA> other natural resources
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 517.95 523.66 <NA> and perhaps one day we 'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste mw
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 524.19 529.91 <NA> i think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms and jeanny and i have shown
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 529.84 538.88 <NA> <unk> that even mistakes can lead to discoveries einstein once said you can 't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them
MirandaWang_2013 1 MirandaWang_2013 539.29 547.44 <NA> if we 're making plastic synthetically then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically thank you
