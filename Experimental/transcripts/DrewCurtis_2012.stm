DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 22.12 25.14 <NA> <unk> by a company called gooseberry natural resources
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 26.45 33.66 <NA> <unk> owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 34.85 42.11 <NA> now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented but it does happen all the time <unk> take something already being done
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 42.11 47.74 <NA> and patent it for an emerging technology like phone calls on the internet
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 47.5 54.97 <NA> or video listings for tv shows or radio but for cellphones <unk> and so on the
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 54.93 63.52 <NA> <unk> problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional <unk> and as a result most of these lawsuits end in settlements 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 63.03 72.55 <NA> and because these settlements are under a non disclosure agreement no one knows what the terms were <unk> and as a result the patent troll can claim that they won the case 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 72.84 74.84 <NA> in the case of gooseberry natural
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 75.46 80.96 <NA> <unk> this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 80.73 90.77 <NA> and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release <unk> and it turns out that is press release as in p r 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 90.77 94.83 <NA> now my company fark <unk> deals with news ostensibly <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 94.59 100.29 <NA> and as a result we were not in violation of this patent so case closed right
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 102.5 112.05 <NA> <unk> one of the major problems with patent law is that in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 112.05 119.37 <NA> which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they 're suing you on and this can take quite a while 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 119.93 128.16 <NA> you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes eighteen months when you win 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 128.27 129.82 <NA> that is your best case
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 129.78 132.13 <NA> <unk> outcome when you get sued by a patent troll <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 131.91 140.5 <NA> now i had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit but one by one they settled out of the case <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 140.1 147.28 <NA> even though and this is important none of these companies infringed on this patent not a one of them 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 147.21 149.35 <NA> and they started settling out 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 150.03 154.88 <NA> the reason they settled out is because it 's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit clearly two million
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 154.81 164.78 <NA> <unk> dollars cheaper in some cases and much worse if you actually lose <unk> it would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company especially a small eight man shop like my company <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 164.56 178.4 <NA> six months into the lawsuit we finally reached the discovery phase <unk> and in discovery phase we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 177.91 179.97 <NA> now perhaps it 's because no
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 179.99 186.51 <NA> <unk> such screenshots actually existed <unk> but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle their attorney 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 186.44 195.99 <NA> ah yes <unk> my company 's having a reorganization on our end never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l a with no employees 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 195.65 199.9 <NA> and we 'd like to go ahead and close this out so would you mind
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 211.86 214.48 <NA> <unk> we didn 't have high hopes for that outcome 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 215.22 219.07 <NA> but they settled no counter offer <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 219.33 226.69 <NA> now as mentioned before one of the reasons i can talk to you about this is because there 's no non disclosure agreement on this case now how did that happen 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 226.69 229.82 <NA> well during the settlement process when we received our copy
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 230.02 235.07 <NA> <unk> i struck it my attorney said nah no chance of that working it came back signed <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 235.36 240.44 <NA> now why you can call them they 're not under nda either 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 240.22 243.47 <NA> now what did i learn from this case <unk> well three things <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 243.04 249.3 <NA> first of all if you can don 't fight the patent fight the infringement 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 249.3 253.38 <NA> patents are very difficult to overturn infringement is a lot easier to disprove
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 255.1 264.9 <NA> <unk> make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 264.77 266.8 <NA> now the reason this works
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 266.47 271.56 <NA> is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they 're able to recover in settlements 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 271.31 276.96 <NA> if it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money they become less interested in pursuing the case <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 276.77 279.97 <NA> finally make sure that you can tell them
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 279.96 286.67 <NA> <unk> that you will make this process as annoying and as painful and as difficult as possible for them <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 286.67 296.68 <NA> now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way it turns out because they 're paid on contingency it works really really well in reverse don 't forget that 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 296.64 304.97 <NA> so what does all this mean well to sum up it boils down to one thing <unk> don 't negotiate with terrorists
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 310.48 315.41 <NA> patent trolls have done more damage to the united states economy than any domestic <unk>
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 315.36 321.05 <NA> or foreign terrorist organization in history every year <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 325 331.59 <NA> plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits <unk> now this is the point in the talk where i 'm supposed to
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 331.1 338.88 <NA> come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system and the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 338.48 342.06 <NA> different outcomes in mind for the patent system <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 341.6 348.93 <NA> the health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors the hi tech industry would like stronger protections for producers <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 348.93 354.91 <NA> and these goals aren 't necessarily diametrically opposed but they are at odds <unk> and as a result patent trolls can kind of
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 354.84 364.66 <NA> <unk> live in the space in between so unfortunately i 'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem however i did have this idea <unk> 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 365.01 370.06 <NA> and it was kind of good <unk> and i thought i should patent this 
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 371.94 379.97 <NA> behold patent infringement via mobile device defined as a computer which is not stationary
DrewCurtis_2012 1 DrewCurtis_2012 380.4 386.76 <NA> <unk> my solution award me this patent and i will troll them out of existence <unk> thank you
