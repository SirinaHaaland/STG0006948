ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 21.85 29.91 <NA> and very much to myself and kind of as a way of surviving i would go into my own very personal
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 29.87 38.25 <NA> <unk> space <unk> and i would make things <unk> i would make things for people as a way of you know giving showing them my my love <unk>
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 37.97 42.72 <NA> i would go into these private places and i would put my ideas

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 47.86 54.12 <NA> so the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 54 55 <NA> with
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 55.19 62.47 <NA> not only the idea realm <unk> but also with very much the feeling realm <unk> and the
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 62.4 64.2 <NA> the ideas are
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 64.21 73.36 <NA> are very disparate i 'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces and there 's no real connection between one or the other except that they sort of come out of my brain
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 72.99 79.31 <NA> and they 're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by by looking at life and seeing
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 79.81 85.88 <NA> <unk> nature and seeing objects and just having having kind of playful random thoughts about things
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 85.57 91.55 <NA> when i was a child i started to explore
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 91.42 98.21 <NA> motion i fell in love with the way things moved <unk> so i started to explore motion by
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 98.21 104.34 <NA> by making little flipbooks <unk> and this is one that i did probably like when i was around seventh grade
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 104.96 111.83 <NA> <unk> and i remember when i was doing this <unk> i was thinking about that that little rock there <unk> and the pathway

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 118 125.46 <NA> would come shooting out of the car <unk> so <unk> on my mind i was thinking about the the trajectory of
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 125.63 128.53 <NA> the vehicles and of course when you 're a little kid
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 130.62 135.61 <NA> so it has to end with this gratuitous violence <unk> 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 137.43 145.91 <NA> so that was how i i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it now when i went to
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 155.14 164.81 <NA> <unk> and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests when i was in high school i loved to program computers <unk> so i sort of liked
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 164.81 167.72 <NA> the the logical flow of events
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 167.8 173.22 <NA> <unk> i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 173.03 179.52 <NA> and becoming a surgeon because it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 180.76 190.02 <NA> so i started taking art courses and i found a way to make sculpture that that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 189.95 191.73 <NA> with
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 191.39 196.14 <NA> coming up with different kinds of logical

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 212.33 220.85 <NA> so i was able to sort of exercise all of that now <unk> this kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 220.85 224.38 <NA> and it 's full of
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 223.95 229.97 <NA> many little trivial end points like there 's a little foot here that just drags

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 243.74 254.07 <NA> any other engineer <unk> in that i love to solve problems i love to figure things out but the end result of what i 'm doing is really completely ambiguous
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 257.42 259.65 <NA> that 's pretty ambiguous
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 260.51 267.39 <NA> <unk> the next piece that is going to come up is
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 266.93 275.26 <NA> an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 276.39 281.18 <NA> <unk> i gave myself the problem since i 'm always liking to solve problems i gave myself the problem of
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 281 282.59 <NA> turning a crank
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 282.59 289.9 <NA> in one direction <unk> and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 291.33 300.05 <NA> so when i started this i didn 't have an overall plan for the machine <unk> but i did have a sense of the gesture and
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 300 308.96 <NA> <unk> a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space <unk> and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 310.66 317.72 <NA> that little gear there switches back and forth to change direction <unk> and that 's a little found object 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 319.63 324.93 <NA> so a lot of the pieces that i 've made they involve found objects
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 331.94 336.24 <NA> <unk> like doing visual puns all the time when i see objects i imagine them
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 336.04 344.94 <NA> in motion i imagine what can be said with them this next one here machine with wishbone 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 345.35 347.55 <NA> it came about from
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 347.06 353.68 <NA> from playing with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but i always play with things
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 354.93 360.62 <NA> <unk> i had this wishbone and i thought <unk> it 's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long and
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 360.62 365.95 <NA> i started to make him walk across the table and i thought oh i can make a little machine that will do that 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 368.1 375.14 <NA> so i made this device linked it up and the wishbone walks and because the wishbone
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 377.74 382.82 <NA> <unk> it 's sort of a point where i think we we can enter into it
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 383.98 385.91 <NA> and that 's the whole piece 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 386.65 388.76 <NA> that 's about that big
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 395.34 400.2 <NA> this kind of work is also very much like puppetry 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 400.55 408.48 <NA> <unk> the found object is in a sense the puppet <unk> and i 'm the puppeteer at first because i 'm playing with an object <unk> 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 408.48 415.05 <NA> but then i make the machine which is sort of the stand in for me and it is able to achieve the action that i want <unk> 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 417.2 424.87 <NA> the next piece i 'll show you is a much more conceptual thought <unk> and it 's a little piece
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 425.1 427 <NA> <unk> cory 's yellow chair 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 427.62 435.88 <NA> i had this image in my mind when i saw my son 's little chair <unk> and i saw it explode
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 435.51 438.22 <NA> up and out and
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 442.59 450.08 <NA> so the way i saw this in my mind at first was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed and the pieces would move
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 450.94 454.94 <NA> <unk> and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 454.54 461.78 <NA> to the point where they would they would approach infinite speed back to the center <unk> and they would coalesce for just a moment
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 461.59 465.53 <NA> <unk> so you could you could perceive that there was a chair there 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 465.73 469.5 <NA> for me it 's kind of a feeling
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 469.32 474.87 <NA> about the fleetingness of the present moment and i wanted to express that now <unk> the
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 475 481.38 <NA> <unk> machine is in this case it 's a real approximation of that because obviously you can 't move physical matter
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 481.37 488.44 <NA> infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously <unk> this whole thing is about four feet
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 488.2 492.54 <NA> wide and the chair itself is only about a few inches 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 496.91 499.96 <NA> now this is a funny sort of conceptual
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 500.1 501.97 <NA> <unk> and yesterday we were talking about
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 501.8 503.77 <NA> danny hillis '

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 515.07 524.54 <NA> so that means that the the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once <unk> 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 524.54 528.28 <NA> so i 've invented it in concrete because it doesn 't really matter 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 528.03 529.73 <NA> because it could run all the time
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 532.84 538.08 <NA> now a completely different thought <unk> i 'm always imagining myself
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 538.08 540.18 <NA> in different situations
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 539.73 544.97 <NA> i 'm imagining myself as a machine what would i love i would love to be bathed in oil 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 545.59 550.05 <NA> so this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 558.71 560.28 <NA> <unk> it 's really just sort of
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 560.27 567.76 <NA> for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil and then i got a call from a friend
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 567.76 573.51 <NA> who wanted to have a show of erotic art <unk> and i didn 't have any pieces but when she suggested
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 573.23 579.94 <NA> to be in the show this piece came to mind so it 's sort of related but you can see it 's much more overtly erotic
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 582.3 588.46 <NA> <unk> and this one i call machine with grease it 's just continually ejaculating and it 's 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 588.78 591.1 <NA> this is a happy machine i 'll tell you it
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 591.84 593.98 <NA> 's definitely happy 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 596.97 600.02 <NA> from an engineering point of view <unk> this is just a
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 601.57 606.92 <NA> <unk> and then again this is a found object a little fan that i that i found and i thought 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 606.76 614.54 <NA> what about the gesture of opening the fan and how how simply could i state something and in a case like this
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 614.29 617.03 <NA> <unk> i 'm trying to make something which
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 617.35 624.78 <NA> which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 631.34 640.25 <NA> <unk> is very important because i 'm inventing machines but i 'm also inventing tools to make machines and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 640.25 649.84 <NA> so this is a little wire bending tool after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers i made that tool <unk> and then i made this other tool for sort of
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 650 652.03 <NA> centering gears very quickly
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 653.19 660.38 <NA> sort of developing my own little world of technology my life completely changed

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 662.79 667.25 <NA> and that was that tool <unk> it completely changed what i could do

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 679.93 681.68 <NA> <unk> little bits of solder in 
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 682.36 690.42 <NA> so that 's a finished gear when i moved to boston <unk> i joined a group

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 694.54 704.61 <NA> the idea their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street <unk> and there 'd be no subjective
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 705.17 709.95 <NA> decision about what was the best it would be whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner
ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 710.27 721.35 <NA> so i made this is my first racing sculpture <unk> and i thought oh <unk> i 'm going to make a cart <unk> and i 'm going to have it i 'm going to have my hand writing ' faster '

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 734.85 745.27 <NA> was every time you finish writing the word i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road so i would never win the race because i 'm always stopping but

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 761.95 771.38 <NA> in some ways the most complete kind of piece because when i was a kid i also played a lot of guitar <unk> and when i had this thought <unk>

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 832.81 836.24 <NA> and that leads me to the thought that

ArthurGanson_2004 1 ArthurGanson_2004 868.04 875.02 <NA> someone brings it into their own mind then there 's a cycle that has been completed
