RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 13 18.89 <NA> <unk> i 'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 18.43 27.83 <NA> headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and like this when they have to do with air quality or smog they 're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 27.37 29.76 <NA> recently the headlines looked like this when the
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 29.72 35.68 <NA> <unk> intergovernmental panel on climate change <unk> or ipcc put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 35.5 42.31 <NA> that report was written by six hundred and twenty scientists from forty countries they wrote almost one thousand pages on the topic <unk> 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 42.31 50.05 <NA> and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400 plus scientists and reviewers from one hundred and thirteen countries <unk> it 's a big community <unk> such a big
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 50.4 56.99 <NA> <unk> in fact that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world over fifteen thousand scientists go to san francisco every year for that
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 56.75 67.09 <NA> every one of those scientists is in a research group and every research group studies a wide variety of topics for us at cambridge it 's as varied as the el nio oscillation which affects weather and climate to the <unk>
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 66.99 72.52 <NA> <unk> assimilation of satellite data to emissions from crops that produce biofuels which is what i study 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 75.28 81.54 <NA> <unk> there are phd students like me <unk> and we study incredibly narrow topics things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 81.33 91.65 <NA> and one of the molecules i study is called isoprene which is here it 's a small organic molecule you 've probably never heard of it the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to nine hundred zeta illion
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 91.6 104.97 <NA> <unk> ten to the 21st molecules of isoprene <unk> but despite its very small weight <unk> enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet <unk> it 's a huge amount of stuff it 's equal to the weight of methane and because it 's so
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 104.87 115.14 <NA> <unk> much stuff it 's really important for the atmospheric system <unk> because it 's important to the atmospheric system <unk> we go to all lengths to study this thing <unk> we blow it up and look at the pieces this is the euphore smog chamber <unk>
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 115.04 125.35 <NA> <unk> in spain atmospheric explosions or full combustion takes about fifteen thousand times longer than what happens in your car <unk> but still we look at the pieces <unk> we run enormous models on supercomputers
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 125.31 137.63 <NA> <unk> this is what i happen to do our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each on minute timescales it takes weeks to perform our integrations <unk> and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 137.63 149.87 <NA> we also fly all over the world looking for this thing i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia there are others <unk> we found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of scientific
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 150.22 158.19 <NA> <unk> off this tower to look for isoprene and other things while we were there this is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above and the tower from below
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 158.19 162.56 <NA> on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us <unk> and this plane the model <unk>
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 163.54 174.84 <NA> <unk> run by faam <unk> normally flies one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty people so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today but we didn 't just fly it we were flying at one hundred meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 175 185.22 <NA> incredibly dangerous stuff <unk> we have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering we need special flight clearance as you come around the banks in these valleys the forces <unk>
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 185.12 195.31 <NA> <unk> can get up to two gs <unk> the scientists must be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while on board so as you can imagine the inside of the aircraft doesn 't look like one you 'd take on vacation <unk> 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 204.93 213.98 <NA> <unk> sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule they write one scientific paper on the subject and out of that field campaign we 'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 213.98 217.51 <NA> as a body of knowledge builds up it will form one subsection or one <unk>
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 218.69 224.99 <NA> of an assessment like the ipcc although we have others <unk> and each one of the eleven chapters of the
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 225.88 229.52 <NA> <unk> six to ten subsections so you can imagine the scale of the effort 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 229.36 240.83 <NA> in each one of the assessments we write we always tag on a summary and the summary is written for a non scientific audience <unk> and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these <unk> 
RachelPike_2009G 1 RachelPike_2009G 240.91 242.16 <NA> thank you very much
