AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 110.65 114.12 <NA> but the surprising thing is it wasn 't always like this 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 113.72 115.53 <NA> this is l 'ospedale degli <unk>

AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 121.55 129.97 <NA> and when i look at this building and then think about hospitals today what amazes me is this building 's ambition it 's just a really great building
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 129.96 139.19 <NA> <unk> it has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings so they just feel more comfortable to be in

AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 140.9 144.82 <NA> somehow <unk> we 've forgotten that that 's even possible for a hospital 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 144.66 148.93 <NA> now <unk> if we want better buildings for dying then we have to talk about it 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 148.93 154.97 <NA> but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable we don 't talk about it and we don 't question how we as a society
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 154.96 156.38 <NA> <unk> approach death 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 156.31 166.13 <NA> one of the things that surprised me most in my research though is how changeable attitudes actually are this is the first crematorium in the u k which was built in woking in the <unk>

AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 184.01 193.96 <NA> so this conversation about death and architecture was what i wanted to start when i did my first exhibition on it in venice in june which was called death in venice 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 195.35 204.97 <NA> it was designed to be quite playful so that people would literally engage with it this is one of our exhibits which is an interactive map of london that shows just how much of the real estate in the city
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 205.16 214.33 <NA> is given over to death and dying <unk> and as you wave your hand across the map the name of that piece of real estate the building or cemetery is revealed <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 214.08 218.97 <NA> another of our exhibits was a series of postcards that people could take away with them <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 218.97 224.15 <NA> and they showed people 's homes and hospitals and cemeteries and mortuaries <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 223.97 229.27 <NA> and they tell the story of the different spaces that we pass through on either side of death <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 228.93 229.97 <NA> we wanted to
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 229.9 234.32 <NA> <unk> show that where we die is a key part of how we die 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 235.03 241.88 <NA> now the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition especially the audio visual works <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 241.65 248.61 <NA> we had people dancing and running and jumping as they tried to activate the exhibits in different ways <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 248.61 254.97 <NA> and at a certain point they would kind of stop and remember that they were in an exhibition about death and that maybe that 's not
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 254.99 256.68 <NA> <unk> how you 're supposed to act 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 256.19 261.22 <NA> but actually i would question whether there is one way that you 're supposed to act around death 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 261.01 269.56 <NA> and if there 's not i 'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is and what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014U 1 AlisonKilling_2014U 269.56 274.54 <NA> and mightn 't it be a little less like this and a little more like this
