BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 205.07 215.23 <NA> that will become more practical but right now you pretty much have to take silicon put it in an oven at one thousand six hundred f for seventeen hours to make the cells a lot of people are working to try and reduce <unk>

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 239.44 253.8 <NA> this seemed practical now because a lot of new technologies had come in the twenty five years since i had last looked at it there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques not to mention really cheap miniature motors brushless motors servomotors stepper motors that are used in printers and scanners

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 293.27 300.07 <NA> to create a new type of concentrator and i 'll show you what we came up with traditionally concentrators look like this those shapes are parabolas

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 315.21 324.9 <NA> collector that would gather much more than one degree of light with no moving parts <unk> so we created a genetic algorithm to try this out we made a model in excel of a multisurface reflector and an amazing

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 340.93 349.93 <NA> and each of them collect light in the following way if the sunlight strikes right here it might bounce right to the center the hot spot directly <unk> but if the sun is off axis and comes from the
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 350.52 360.33 <NA> <unk> it might hit two places and take two bounces <unk> so for direct light it takes only one bounce for off axis light it might take two and for extreme off axis it might take three 
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 360.34 368.96 <NA> your efficiency goes down with more bounces because you lose about ten percent with each bounce <unk> but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle 
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 368.77 373.45 <NA> so about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component 
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 372.99 379.94 <NA> solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though on an average adjusted day a solar cell because the sun 's moving across the sky
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 380.1 390.32 <NA> <unk> the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off axis angles it collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day <unk> so even this although it was great with no moving parts <unk>
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 390.27 404.67 <NA> we could achieve high temperatures wasn 't enough we needed to beat solar cells <unk> so we took a look at another idea <unk> we looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track <unk> so what you see here is twelve separate petals that each could be controlled with individual
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 404.63 415.17 <NA> <unk> microprocessors that would only cost a dollar <unk> you can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now and you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes <unk>
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 415.12 429.97 <NA> for a dollar <unk> so we can control all twelve of these petals for under fifty dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more but only move the petals the whole system would have a much lower profile but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 429.96 435.37 <NA> <unk> a day now that we have concentrated sunlight what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity <unk>

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 443.1 450.08 <NA> and one of the great ones of all time <unk> james watt 's steam engine of one thousand seven hundred and eighty eight was a major major breakthrough <unk> james watt didn 't actually invent the steam

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 479.96 490.23 <NA> <unk> so they 're not good for distributed power generation they 're also very high pressure so they 're dangerous another type of engine is the hot air engine and the hot air engine also was not invented <unk>
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 490.13 498.1 <NA> <unk> by robert stirling but robert stirling came along in one thousand eight hundred and sixteen and radically improved it this engine because it was so interesting it only worked on air no steam
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 505.02 517.56 <NA> <unk> came along and also he didn 't invent the internal combustion engine <unk> he just refined it he showed it in paris in one thousand eight hundred and sixty seven and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up you could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space 
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 517.56 522.56 <NA> and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications so once you have mobility
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 522.35 524.93 <NA> you 're making a lot of engines because you 've got lots of units as
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 528.37 538.85 <NA> <unk> this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn 't so because it went into mass production costs were reduced one hundred years of refinement emissions were reduced 
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 538.42 550.31 <NA> tremendous production value there have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built compared to thousands of stirling engines built and not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore only large ones for big operations <unk> 
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 549.85 554.97 <NA> so after looking at these three and forty seven others we concluded that the stirling engine would be the
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 554.93 563.95 <NA> <unk> best one to use i want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works <unk> so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 563.71 565.39 <NA> it was practical
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 565.39 579.97 <NA> weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around but if you 're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn 't matter so much we also discovered that efficiency doesn 't matter so much if your energy source is
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 580.55 587.42 <NA> normally efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine <unk> 
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 587.42 596.33 <NA> but if your fuel source is free <unk> then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine <unk> so you don 't want to optimize for efficiency you want to optimize for power per dollar <unk> 
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 596.14 600.05 <NA> so using that new twist with the new criteria we thought we could relook at the stirling
BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 600.55 610.73 <NA> <unk> and also bring genetic algorithms in basically robert stirling didn 't have gordon moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power <unk> so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to <unk>

BillGross_2003 1 BillGross_2003 646.71 650.26 <NA> the problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent
