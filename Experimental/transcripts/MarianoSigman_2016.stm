MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 12.94 22.67 <NA> <unk> we have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient greeks dressed how they lived how they fought <unk> but how did they think 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 22.9 27.8 <NA> one natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 27.37 29.97 <NA> our ability to imagine to be
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 29.96 40.02 <NA> <unk> conscious to dream have always been the same <unk> another possibility is that the social transformations that have shaped our culture
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 39.59 44.31 <NA> may have also changed the structural columns of human thought <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 44.39 53.29 <NA> we may all have different opinions about this actually it 's a long standing philosophical debate <unk> but is this question even amenable to science
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 54.78 64.45 <NA> <unk> here i 'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient greek cities looked just based on a few bricks 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 64.02 66.59 <NA> that the writings of a culture
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 66.17 71.11 <NA> are the archaeological records <unk> the fossils of human thought <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 71.4 79.97 <NA> and in fact <unk> doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient books of human culture julian jaynes came
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 79.93 90.02 <NA> <unk> in the ' 70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis that only three thousand years ago humans were what today
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 89.8 98.4 <NA> we would call schizophrenics and he made this claim based on the fact that the first humans described in these books
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 98.4 103.92 <NA> behaved consistently in different traditions and in different places of the world as if they
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 104.98 106.96 <NA> and obeying voices
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 106.75 115.2 <NA> that they perceived as coming from the gods <unk> or from the muses what today we would call hallucinations <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 115.37 121.96 <NA> and only then as time went on they began to recognize that they were the creators <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 121.96 125.13 <NA> the owners of these inner voices <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 127.98 131.05 <NA> <unk> the ability to think about their own thoughts <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 131.28 138.28 <NA> so jaynes 's theory is that consciousness at least in the way we perceive it today 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 137.85 141.73 <NA> where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 141.42 144.94 <NA> is a quite recent cultural development <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 144.96 154.61 <NA> and this theory is quite spectacular but it has an obvious problem which is that it 's built on just a few and very specific examples <unk> so the question is whether the theory that
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 154.69 159.39 <NA> <unk> introspection built up in human history only about three thousand years ago
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 159.18 162.86 <NA> can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 163.03 166.88 <NA> and the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 166.87 175.02 <NA> it 's not like plato woke up one day and then he wrote hello i 'm plato and as of today i have a fully introspective consciousness
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 178.07 188.13 <NA> <unk> this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem we need to find the emergence of a concept that 's never said <unk> the word introspection
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 187.64 190.56 <NA> does not appear a single time
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 190.36 192.93 <NA> in the books we want to analyze <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 193.22 198.27 <NA> so our way to solve this is to build the space of words 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 198.11 204.7 <NA> this is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 204.87 207.73 <NA> <unk> indicative of how closely related they are 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 207.9 216.73 <NA> so for instance you want the words dog and cat to be very close together <unk> but the words grapefruit and logarithm to be very far away <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 216.33 221.17 <NA> and this has to be true for any two words within the space <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 221.16 229.97 <NA> and there are different ways that we can construct the space of words one is just asking the experts a bit like we do with dictionaries <unk> another possibility
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 230.25 239.45 <NA> is following the simple assumption that when two words are related they tend to appear in the same sentences in the same paragraphs in the same documents 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 239.45 243.26 <NA> more often than would be expected just by pure chance <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 243.73 246.05 <NA> and this simple hypothesis 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 246.05 253.7 <NA> this simple method <unk> with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex and high dimensional space <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 253.24 254.76 <NA> turns out to be quite
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 254.72 255.78 <NA> <unk> effective 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 255.65 263.34 <NA> and just to give you a flavor of how well this works this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 263.06 272.64 <NA> and you can see first that words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods so you get the fruits <unk> the body parts the computer parts the scientific terms and so on 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 272.69 279.97 <NA> the algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy <unk> so for instance you can see that the scientific terms
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 280.07 284.98 <NA> break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 284.88 293.25 <NA> and then there are very fine things for instance the word astronomy which seems a bit bizarre where it is is actually exactly where it should be 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 293.25 295.07 <NA> between what it is 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 294.84 299.71 <NA> an actual science <unk> and between what it describes <unk> the astronomical terms 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 299.67 304.94 <NA> and we could go on and on with this actually if you stare at this for a while and you just build random trajectories
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 305.19 309.56 <NA> you will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 309.52 315.32 <NA> and this is because in a way walking in this space is like walking in the mind <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 315.55 325.11 <NA> and the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 335.99 345.79 <NA> <unk> are just very far away <unk> and so once we 've built the space <unk> the question of the history of introspection <unk> or of the history of any concept
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 345.79 350.32 <NA> which before could seem abstract and somehow vague
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 350.82 352.22 <NA> <unk> becomes concrete
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 352.01 355.75 <NA> becomes amenable to quantitative science 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 355.71 363.23 <NA> all that we have to do is take the books we digitize them <unk> and we take this stream of words as a trajectory
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 362.99 368.92 <NA> and project them into the space <unk> and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 368.49 372.25 <NA> circling closely to the concept of introspection <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 372.27 379.97 <NA> and with this we could analyze the history of introspection in the ancient greek tradition for which we have the best available written
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 380.02 385.91 <NA> <unk> record so what we did is we took all the books we just ordered them by time
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 385.69 394.25 <NA> for each book we take the words and we project them to the space <unk> and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection and we just average that 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 394.09 396.75 <NA> and then we ask whether as time goes on
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 396.59 404.91 <NA> and on these books get closer and closer and closer to the concept of introspection <unk> and this is exactly what happens
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 404.9 407.01 <NA> <unk> in the ancient greek tradition <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 407.21 418.98 <NA> so you can see that for the oldest books in the homeric tradition <unk> there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection <unk> but about four centuries before christ this starts ramping up very rapidly
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 418.49 424.99 <NA> to an almost five fold increase of books getting closer and closer and closer to the concept of introspection
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 426.12 434.41 <NA> <unk> and one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different independent tradition 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 434.43 441.19 <NA> so we just ran this same analysis on the judeo christian tradition <unk> and we got virtually the same pattern <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 441.09 451.84 <NA> again you see a small increase for the oldest books in the old testament <unk> and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the new testament <unk> and then we get the peak of introspection in 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 451.83 454.97 <NA> the confessions of saint augustine about four centuries
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 455.01 456.41 <NA> after christ <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 456.4 458.81 <NA> and this was very important 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 458.32 466.82 <NA> because saint augustine had been recognized by scholars <unk> philologists historians as one of the founders of introspection <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 466.57 470.69 <NA> actually some believe him to be the father of modern psychology <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 470.5 474.51 <NA> so our algorithm which has the virtue
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 475.58 481.26 <NA> <unk> of being objective <unk> and of course of being extremely fast it just runs in a fraction of a second
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 480.95 484.78 <NA> can capture some of the most important conclusions
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 484.6 487.5 <NA> of this long tradition of investigation <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 487.79 495.43 <NA> and this is in a way one of the beauties of science <unk> which is that now this idea can be translated
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 495.2 504.97 <NA> and generalized to a whole lot of different domains <unk> so in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness <unk> maybe the most challenging question
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 505.02 506.81 <NA> <unk> we can pose to ourselves
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 506.81 515.47 <NA> is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness to put it more precisely whether the words we say today
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 514.98 519.14 <NA> can tell us something of where our our minds will be
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 518.96 523.21 <NA> in a few days in a few months or a few years from now 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 523.11 529.61 <NA> and in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate our respiration
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 529.93 534.74 <NA> <unk> genes on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 534.55 541.13 <NA> we can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak <unk> we tweet we email we write 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 540.82 545.03 <NA> can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 544.63 553.49 <NA> with our minds <unk> and with guillermo cecchi who has been my brother in this adventure we took on this task 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 553.75 554.94 <NA> and we did so
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 554.66 562.86 <NA> <unk> so by analyzing the recorded speech of thirty four young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 562.94 571.56 <NA> and so what we did is we measured speech at day one <unk> and then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict within a window of almost three years 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 571.58 574.59 <NA> the future development of psychosis <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 574.94 579.49 <NA> but despite our hopes we got failure
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 579.84 585.45 <NA> <unk> after failure there was just not enough information in semantics
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 585.46 590.32 <NA> to predict the future organization of the mind it was good enough
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 589.83 594.34 <NA> to distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 594.34 600.17 <NA> a bit like we had done for the ancient texts <unk> but not to predict the future onset of psychosis
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 601.12 602.61 <NA> <unk> but then we realized
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 602.37 608.96 <NA> that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying <unk> but how they were saying it 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 609.16 618.65 <NA> more specifically it was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were <unk> but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood to the other one <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 618.76 623.19 <NA> and so we came up with this measure which we termed semantic coherence 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 623.19 629.73 <NA> which essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic <unk> within one semantic category
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 630.8 635.25 <NA> and it turned out to be that for this group of thirty four people 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 634.85 641.34 <NA> the algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict with one hundred percent accuracy 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 641.03 644.4 <NA> who developed psychosis and who will not <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 644.48 650.05 <NA> and this was something that could not be achieved not even close with all the
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 655.32 663.04 <NA> <unk> remember vividly while i was working on this i was sitting at my computer and i saw a bunch of tweets by polo
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 662.58 668.26 <NA> polo had been my first student back in buenos aires and at the time he was living in new york <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 667.8 673.78 <NA> and there was something in this tweets i could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 673.5 678.92 <NA> but i got this strong hunch this strong intuition that something was going wrong
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 680.29 684.8 <NA> <unk> so i picked up the phone and i called polo and in fact he was not feeling well <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 684.85 689.69 <NA> and this simple fact that reading in between the lines 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 689.32 697.07 <NA> i could sense <unk> through words <unk> his feelings was a simple but very effective way to help 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 697.45 699.63 <NA> what i tell you today
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 699.4 702.11 <NA> is that we 're getting close to understanding
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 701.65 704.97 <NA> how we can convert this intuition that we
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 704.93 709.38 <NA> <unk> all have that we all share into an algorithm <unk> 
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 709.61 719.46 <NA> and in doing so we may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health based on objective <unk> quantitative
MarianoSigman_2016 1 MarianoSigman_2016 718.97 721.74 <NA> and automated analysis
