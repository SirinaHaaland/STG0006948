LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 14.26 18.56 <NA> <unk> i want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 18.37 24.99 <NA> <unk> the first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious and that 's that our species homo sapiens is actually really
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 25 28.02 <NA> <unk> really smart like ridiculously smart like
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 27.85 31.47 <NA> you 're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 31.82 44.62 <NA> and this is of course <unk> not the first time you 've probably recognized this of course in addition to being smart we 're also an extremely vain species <unk> so we like pointing out the fact that we 're smart you know so i could turn to pretty much any sage from
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 44.43 54.07 <NA> shakespeare to stephen colbert to point out things like the fact that we 're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 55.14 59.57 <NA> <unk> but of course there 's a second observation about the human species that i want to focus on a little bit more <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 59.57 67.78 <NA> and that 's the fact that even though we 're actually really smart <unk> sometimes uniquely smart <unk> we can also be incredibly incredibly dumb
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 67.32 76.28 <NA> when it comes to some aspects of our decision making now i 'm seeing lots of smirks out there don 't worry i 'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 76.28 79.97 <NA> but of course just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 80.05 95.04 <NA> <unk> of human ineptitude and we 've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face we 've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create these markets that were supposed to be foolproof we 've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 95.04 104.94 <NA> but both of these two embarrassing examples i think don 't highlight what i think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make which is that we 'd like to think that the mistakes we make
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 104.96 110.14 <NA> <unk> are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of fail blog worthy decisions <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 109.9 118.95 <NA> but it turns out what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us when put in certain contexts will actually make very specific mistakes 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 118.95 124.75 <NA> the errors we make are actually predictable we make them again and again and they 're actually immune to lots of
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 125.43 131.71 <NA> <unk> when we get negative feedback we still the next time we 're face with a certain context tend to make the same errors <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 131.22 141.2 <NA> and so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature what i 'm most curious about is how is a species that 's as smart as we are
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 141.04 149.84 <NA> capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time you know we 're the smartest thing out there why can 't we figure this out in some sense where do our mistakes really come
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 150.67 154.01 <NA> <unk> and having thought about this a little bit i see a couple different possibilities 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 153.84 164.24 <NA> one possibility is in some sense it 's not really our fault because we 're a smart species we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super super complicated sometimes too complicated <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 164.14 174.38 <NA> <unk> for us to even actually understand even though we 've actually created them <unk> we create financial markets that are super complex we create mortgage terms that we can 't actually deal with and of course <unk> if we are <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 174.33 179.4 <NA> put in environments where we can 't deal with it in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 179.96 190.11 <NA> <unk> if this was the case we 'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error we 'd actually just say okay let 's figure out the kinds of technologies we can 't deal with the kinds of environments that are bad get <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 190.01 195.36 <NA> <unk> rid of those design things better <unk> and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 205.08 215.26 <NA> <unk> this is a hint that i 've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors and what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way over and over <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 215.16 229.49 <NA> <unk> again it feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways this is a possibility that i worry a little bit more about because <unk> if it 's us that 's messed up it 's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it we might just have to accept the fact that we 're error prone
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 230.16 232.32 <NA> try to design things around it 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 232.08 238.17 <NA> so this is the question my students and i wanted to get at how can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 237.99 248.19 <NA> what we need is a population that 's basically smart can make lots of decisions <unk> but doesn 't have access to any of the systems we have any of the things that might mess us up no human technology human culture 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 248.14 254.94 <NA> <unk> maybe even not human language <unk> and so this is why we turned to these guys here these are one of the guys i work with this is a brown capuchin monkey
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 254.95 265.62 <NA> these guys are new world primates which means they broke off from the human branch about thirty five million years ago <unk> this means that your great great great great great great with about five million greats in there grandmother <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 265.57 270.57 <NA> was probably the same great great great great grandmother with five million greats in there as holly up here you know 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 275.97 286.07 <NA> <unk> the good news about holly though is that she doesn 't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do you know she 's a smart very cut creature a primate as well <unk> but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up so
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 286.02 295.13 <NA> <unk> she 's the perfect test case what if we put holly into the same context as humans does she make the same mistakes as us does she not learn from them and so on <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 300.79 311.78 <NA> <unk> problems at holly see if she messes these things up first problem is just well where should we start because you know it 's great for us but bad for humans we make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts you know where are we actually going to start with this 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 311.78 318.39 <NA> and because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news we said 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 317.97 327.15 <NA> hhmm maybe we should actually start in the financial domain maybe we should look at monkey 's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 327.15 329.97 <NA> of course that 's when we hit a sort second problem a little bit more
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 330.02 334.56 <NA> <unk> methodological which is that maybe you guys don 't know but monkeys don 't actually use money i know 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 334.33 344.77 <NA> you haven 't met them but this is why you know they 're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the atm you know they don 't do this stuff so now we faced you know <unk> a little bit of a problem here how are we actually going to
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 344.72 353.34 <NA> <unk> ask monkeys about money if they don 't actually use it so we said well maybe we should just actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money so that 's just what we did
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 355.1 358.82 <NA> is actually the first unit that i know of of non human currency <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 358.61 365.72 <NA> we weren 't very creative at the time we started these studies so we just called it a token <unk> but this is the unit of currency that we 've taught our monkeys
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 365.72 370.66 <NA> at yale to actually use with humans to actually buy different pieces of food <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 370.44 379.97 <NA> it doesn 't look like much in fact it isn 't like much like most of our money it 's just a piece of metal as those of you who 've taken currencies home from your trip know once you get home it 's actually pretty useless
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 380.04 390.17 <NA> was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it when we first gave it to them in their enclosures <unk> they actually kind of picked them up looked at them they were these kind of weird things but <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 390.07 399.99 <NA> <unk> very quickly the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food and so you see one of our monkeys mayday up here doing this <unk> this is a
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 400 408.88 <NA> b are kind of the points where she 's sort of a little bit curious about these things doesn 't know <unk> there 's this waiting hand from a human experimenter <unk> and mayday quickly figures out apparently the human wants this <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 408.67 410.83 <NA> hands it over and then gets some food it
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 410.83 420.79 <NA> turns out not just mayday all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman so here 's just a quick video of what this looks like here 's mayday she 's going to be trading a token for some food
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 420.58 429.97 <NA> and waiting happily and getting her food here 's felix i think he 's our alpha male he 's a kind of big guy but he too waits patiently gets his food and goes on so the monkeys get really good at
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 429.96 434.8 <NA> <unk> this they 're surprisingly good at this with very little training we just allowed them to pick this up on their own the
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 434.8 444.85 <NA> question is is this anything like human money is this a market at all or did we just do a weird psychologist 's trick by getting monkeys to do something looking smart but not really being smart <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 444.45 451.09 <NA> and so we said <unk> well <unk> what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency if they were really using it like money <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 451.09 454.91 <NA> well <unk> you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 455.05 457.37 <NA> <unk> that humans do when they start exchanging
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 457.2 465.95 <NA> money with each other you might have them start paying attention to price paying attention to how much they buy sort of keeping track of their monkey token as it were 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 465.58 475.17 <NA> do the monkeys do anything like this <unk> and so our monkey marketplace was born the way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 475.85 488.82 <NA> <unk> when they get a hankering for some treats we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market upon entering the market it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because as the monkeys entered the door of the market a
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 488.39 498.87 <NA> human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 498.87 504.97 <NA> the salesmen were students from my lab they dressed differently they were different people and over time they did basically
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 504.93 515.14 <NA> <unk> the same thing so the monkeys could learn you know who sold what at what price you know who was reliable who wasn 't and so on and you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little yellow <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 515.04 524.12 <NA> <unk> food dish and that 's what the monkey can for a single token so everything costs one token but as you can see sometimes tokens buy more than others sometimes more grapes than others 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 530.13 541.43 <NA> but here 's honey she 's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently all of a sudden the market opens here 's her choice one grapes or two grapes you can see honey very good market economist goes with the guy who gives more 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 541.06 549.93 <NA> she could teach our financial advisers a few things or two <unk> so not just honey <unk> most of the monkeys went with guys who had more <unk> most of the monkeys went with guys who
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 550.97 563.27 <NA> <unk> when we introduced sales we saw the monkeys paid attention to that they really cared about their monkey token dollar the more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys ' data using economic tools 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 563.28 574.87 <NA> they basically matched not just qualitatively <unk> but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market <unk> so much so that if you saw the monkeys ' numbers you couldn 't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 575.73 582.79 <NA> <unk> and what we 'd really thought we 'd done is like we 'd actually introduced something that at least for the monkeys and us works like a real financial currency <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 582.62 593.14 <NA> question is do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do <unk> well <unk> we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might one thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 593.09 597.92 <NA> you know just like our own species the monkeys entered the market spent their entire budget and then went
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 605.01 610.03 <NA> the monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity from each other often from us
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 609.87 620.93 <NA> you know things we didn 't necessarily think we were introducing but things we spontaneously saw <unk> so we said <unk> this looks bad can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 620.93 625.05 <NA> one possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out you know 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 625 635.1 <NA> see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years we were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit so we said <unk> let 's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 635 641.38 <NA> <unk> humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges or certain kinds of economic experiments <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 654.78 664.31 <NA> <unk> dollars so ten crisp hundred dollar bills <unk> take these put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you 're going to do with it because it 's yours now you can buy whatever you want donate it take it and so on 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 664.31 674.9 <NA> sounds great but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money and here 's your choice you can either be risky in which case i 'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens if it comes up heads you 're going to get a thousand
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 675.76 687.68 <NA> <unk> if it comes up tails you get nothing <unk> so it 's a chance to get more but it 's pretty risky your other option is a bit safe your just going to get some money for sure i 'm just going to give you five hundred bucks <unk> you can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 687.4 689.67 <NA> so see what your intuition is here
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 689.67 699.78 <NA> <unk> most people actually go with the play it safe option most people say <unk> why should i be risky when i can get one thousand five hundred dollars for sure <unk> this seems like a good bet i 'm going to go with that you might say eh that 's not really
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 700.25 707.5 <NA> <unk> people are a little risk averse so what well the so what comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 707.32 717.36 <NA> so now imagine that i give each and every one of you two thousand dollars twenty crisp hundred dollar bills <unk> now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before think about how you 'd feel sticking it in your wallet 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 717.36 724.32 <NA> and now imagine that i have you make another choice but this time it 's a little bit worse now you 're going to be deciding how you 're going to lose money <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 723.92 729.73 <NA> but you 're going to get the same choice you can either take a risky loss so i 'll flip a coin if it comes up heads
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 729.9 733.72 <NA> <unk> actually lose a lot if it comes up tails you lose nothing you 're fine get to keep the whole thing
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 733.52 740.48 <NA> or you could play it safe <unk> which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $ one hundred bills for certain 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 740.48 750.02 <NA> and i 'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there so maybe you 're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this <unk> which is when presented with these options people don 't choose to
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 750 753.06 <NA> play it safe they actually tend to go a little risky <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 752.82 763.16 <NA> the reason this is irrational is that we 've given people in both situations the same choice <unk> it 's a fifty fifty shot of a thousand or two thousand or just one thousand five hundred dollars with certainty <unk> but <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 763.06 775.11 <NA> <unk> people 's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with so what 's going on well it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 775.37 785.7 <NA> <unk> one is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms you really have to do work to figure out well one option 's a thousand two thousand one is one thousand five hundred instead we find it very easy <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 785.6 795.72 <NA> <unk> to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another so we think of things as oh i 'm going to get more or oh i 'm going to get less this is all well and good except that changes <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 795.62 804.91 <NA> <unk> in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not and this leads to the second bias which economists have called loss aversion the
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 804.84 815.05 <NA> <unk> idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red we really hate it when we have to lose out on some money <unk> and this means that sometimes we 'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this what you saw in that <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 814.95 820.88 <NA> <unk> last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won 't be any loss 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 825.37 828.93 <NA> <unk> we actually become more risky which can actually be really worrying 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 828.69 839.06 <NA> these kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans they 're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer because they 're evaluating them in relative terms they 're why people in the housing market refused <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 838.96 850.05 <NA> <unk> to sell their house because they don 't want to sell at a loss <unk> the question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases <unk> if we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market would they do the same thing as people
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 850.34 858.82 <NA> <unk> and so this is what we did we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe they did the same thing every time or guys who were risky they did things differently half the time 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 858.64 869.04 <NA> and then we gave them options that were bonuses like you guys did in the first scenario so they actually have a chance more <unk> or pieces where they were experiencing losses they actually thought they were going to get more <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 868.99 879.94 <NA> than they really got <unk> and so this is what this looks like we introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen the guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape so it looks pretty good but they 're going to give the monkeys bonuses
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 879.98 890.47 <NA> the guy on the left is a safe bonus all the time he adds one to give the monkeys two the guy on the right is actually a risky bonus <unk> sometimes the monkeys get no bonus so this is a bonus of zero <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 890.42 904.94 <NA> <unk> sometimes the monkeys get two extra for a big bonus now they get three <unk> but this is the same choice you guys just faced do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who 's going to do the same thing on every trial or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 904.9 912.25 <NA> <unk> but big bonus <unk> but risk the possibility of getting no bonus people here played it safe turns out the monkeys play it safe too 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 912.26 925.11 <NA> qualitatively and quantitatively they choose exactly the same way as people when tested in the same thing you might say well maybe the monkeys just don 't like risk maybe we should see how they do with losses and so we ran a second version of this now
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 925.1 935.31 <NA> <unk> the monkeys meet two guys who aren 't giving them bonuses they 're actually giving them less than they expect so they look like they 're starting out with a big amount these are three grapes the monkey 's really psyched for this but now they learn these <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 935.21 949.9 <NA> <unk> guys are going to give them less than they expect they guy on the left is a safe loss every single time he 's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two the guy on the right is the risky loss <unk> sometimes he gives no loss so the monkeys are really psyched but sometimes he actually
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 950.1 953.56 <NA> <unk> big loss taking away two to give the monkeys only one 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 953.07 963.49 <NA> and so what do the monkeys do again same choice they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three <unk> the remarkable <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 963.39 973.81 <NA> <unk> thing to us is that when you give monkeys this choice they do the same irrational thing that people do they actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started this is crazy <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 973.71 979.97 <NA> <unk> because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 980.7 991.01 <NA> so what does all of this mean well what we 've shown is that <unk> first of all we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency <unk> and they do very similar things with it they do some of the smart things we do some of the <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 990.91 1000.11 <NA> <unk> kind of not so nice things we do like steal it and so on <unk> but they also do some of the irrational things we do they systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1000.07 1012.2 <NA> <unk> this is the first take home message of the talk which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought oh i 'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser they 're way cuter than the one at you know don 't do that they 're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1012.37 1013.42 <NA> so you know 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1013.26 1022.58 <NA> a little bad sorry sorry sorry a little bad for monkey investors but of course <unk> you know <unk> the reason you 're laughing is bad for humans too because we 've answered the question we started out with 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1022.58 1024.9 <NA> we wanted to know where these kinds of errors came
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1025.52 1031.59 <NA> <unk> and we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions tweak our technologies to make ourselves better <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1031.59 1039.22 <NA> but what we 've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that in fact they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history you know 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1039.04 1049.99 <NA> maybe it 's not just humans at the right side of this chain that 's duncey <unk> maybe it 's sort of duncey all the way back <unk> and this <unk> if we believe the capuchin monkey results means that these duncey strategies might be
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1050.58 1051.71 <NA> <unk> million years old 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1051.5 1062.56 <NA> that 's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around really really old what do we know about other old strategies like this well one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome you know 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1062.56 1076.13 <NA> think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things fatty things like cheesecake you can 't just shut that off you can 't just look at the dessert cart as say no no no that looks disgusting to me we 're just built differently we 're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1075.9 1079.97 <NA> my guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1080.25 1090.47 <NA> different financial decisions <unk> when you 're watching your stocks plummet into the red when you 're watching your house price go down you 're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1090.47 1098.12 <NA> this means that the biases that lead investors to do badly that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1097.69 1104.46 <NA> so that 's the bad news the question is is there any good news i 'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news <unk> well <unk> the good news i think is
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1105.05 1112.92 <NA> <unk> with at the beginning of the talk <unk> which is that humans are not only smart we 're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom we
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1112.92 1124.93 <NA> 're so good at overcoming our biological limitations you know i flew over here in an airplane i didn 't have to try to flap my wings <unk> i 'm wearing contact lenses now so that i can see all of you i don 't have to rely on my own
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1125.82 1138.64 <NA> <unk> we actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means seemingly pretty easily <unk> but we have to recognize that we have those limitations and here 's the rub <unk> 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1138.64 1144.2 <NA> it was camus who once said that man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is 
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1143.97 1150.11 <NA> but the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1150.55 1160.73 <NA> <unk> the hope is that you all will think about your limitations not necessarily as unovercomable but to recognize them accept them and then use the world of design to actually <unk>
LaurieSantos_2010G 1 LaurieSantos_2010G 1160.63 1168.09 <NA> <unk> figure them out that might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species
