BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 62.41 74.96 <NA> and if we do not the question i think we need to ask ourselves and that 's why it 's on the economy session is to say <unk> if we don 't do all things we really have to start asking ourselves <unk> which ones should we solve first <unk> and that 's
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 75 84.2 <NA> question i 'd like to ask you if we had say <unk> fifty billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 83.71 87.38 <NA> we identified ten of the biggest challenges in the world and i
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 87.18 99.2 <NA> will just briefly read them climate change communicable diseases conflicts education financial instability <unk> governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger population migration <unk> sanitation and water and subsidies and trade barriers <unk>

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 103.53 104.97 <NA> the obvious question would be
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 105.47 119.59 <NA> what do you think are the biggest things where should we start on solving these problems but that 's a wrong problem to ask that was actually the problem that was asked in davos in january <unk> but of course there 's a problem in asking people to focus on problems <unk> because
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 119.41 124.96 <NA> we can 't solve problems surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die <unk> but we don 't have a technology
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 126.42 136.66 <NA> <unk> so the point is not to prioritize problems <unk> but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems <unk> and that would be of course that gets a little more complicated to climate change <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 136.61 145.3 <NA> that would be like kyoto to communicable diseases it might be health clinics or mosquito nets to conflicts it would be u n ' s peacekeeping forces <unk> and so on 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 154.93 159.24 <NA> <unk> priorities and also and that 's of course where economics gets evil
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 159.03 173.27 <NA> to put down what are the things we should not do first <unk> what should be at the bottom of the list please just take thirty seconds perhaps talk to your to your neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world 's biggest issues <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 173.27 174.78 <NA> the amazing part of this

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 182.8 190.01 <NA> think about this process and that 's actually what we did and i also strongly encourage you and i 'm sure we 'll also have these discussions afterwards 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 190.02 196.9 <NA> to think about how do we actually prioritize of course <unk> you have to ask yourself why on earth was such a list never done before 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 196.66 199.81 <NA> and one one reason is that prioritization is
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 201.81 211.96 <NA> <unk> nobody wants to do this of course <unk> every organization would love to be on the top of such a list but every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list and since there are many more not number one
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 211.96 222.02 <NA> spots on the list than there is number ones it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list we 've had the u n for almost sixty years <unk> yet we 've never actually made
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 221.83 229.94 <NA> a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world <unk> and said which of them should we do first <unk> so it doesn 't mean
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 230.04 240.26 <NA> that we are not prioritizing any decision is a prioritization so of course we are still prioritizing if only implicitly and that 's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 240.21 249.99 <NA> <unk> and went in and talked about it so what i 'm proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation when we 've had a menu of choices there are many many things we can do out
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 251 261.21 <NA> <unk> not had the prices nor the sizes <unk> we have not had an idea imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have no idea what the price is you know you have a pizza <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 261.16 274.96 <NA> you 've no idea what the price is it could be at one dollar it could be one thousand dollars <unk> it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right we 'd like to know these things and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do to try to put prices on these issues <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 275.1 280.46 <NA> <unk> and so basically this has been the copenhagen consensus ' process we got thirty of the world 's best economists 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 280.46 286.54 <NA> three in each area so we have three of world 's top economists write about climate change what can we do 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 286.32 289.39 <NA> what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 289.39 302.45 <NA> likewise in communicable diseases <unk> three of the world 's top experts saying <unk> what can we do what would be the price <unk> what should we do about it and what will be the outcome <unk> and so on then we had some of the world 's top economists eight
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 302.24 304.82 <NA> of the world 's top economists including three nobel laureates
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 304.99 311.63 <NA> <unk> meet in copenhagen in may two thousand and four we called them the dream team the cambridge university prefects
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 311.68 317.39 <NA> decided to call them the real madrid of economics that works very well in europe but it doesn 't really work over here
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 317.14 324.96 <NA> <unk> and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list and then you ask why economists <unk> and of course i 'm very happy you asked that
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 325.91 327.57 <NA> <unk> because that 's a very good question 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 327.4 334.34 <NA> the point is of course if you want to know about malaria <unk> you ask a malaria expert if you want to know about climate you ask a climatologist <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 334.18 338.93 <NA> but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first <unk> you can 't ask either of them 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 338.94 344.46 <NA> because that 's not what they do that is what economists do they prioritize they make that
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 344.15 353.86 <NA> in some ways disgusting task of saying <unk> which one should we do first and which one should we do afterwards <unk> so this is the list and this is the one i 'd like to share with you of course you can also see
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 354.93 361.49 <NA> <unk> talk about it more i 'm sure as the day goes on they basically came up with a list where they said there were bad
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 362.52 376.25 <NA> <unk> projects where if you invest a dollar <unk> you get less than a dollar back then there 's fair projects good projects and very good projects and of course it 's the very good projects we should start doing i 'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 376.25 378.16 <NA> these were the bad projects 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 378.24 379.97 <NA> as you might see the
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 379.84 384.98 <NA> <unk> the bottom of the list was climate change this offends a lot of people and that 's probably
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 384.75 390.62 <NA> one of the things where people will say i shouldn 't come back either <unk> and i 'd like to talk about that because that 's really curious <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 390.62 398.72 <NA> why is it it came up and i 'll actually also try to get back to this because it 's probably one of the things that we 'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 398.29 404.97 <NA> the reason why they came up with saying that kyoto or doing something more than kyoto is a bad deal is simply because it 's very inefficient
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 405.02 414.27 <NA> <unk> it 's not saying that global warming is not happening it 's not saying that it 's not a big problem but it 's saying that what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 414.11 423.09 <NA> what they basically show us the average of all macroeconomic models is that kyoto if everyone agreed would cost about one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 423.02 424.81 <NA> that 's a substantial amount of money
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 425.22 434.99 <NA> <unk> two to three times the global development aid that we give the third world every year <unk> yet it would do very little good <unk> all models show it will postpone warming for about six years in two thousand one hundred <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 434.99 441.76 <NA> so the guy in bangladesh who gets a flood in two thousand one hundred can wait until two thousand one hundred and six which is a little good but not very much good
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 441.36 449.96 <NA> <unk> so the idea here really is to say well we 've spent a lot of money doing a little good <unk> and just to give you a sense of reference the u n actually estimate that for half
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 451.42 452.69 <NA> <unk> billion dollars a year <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 452.69 461.9 <NA> we could solve all major basic problems in the world <unk> we could give clean drinking water sanitation basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 461.47 469.7 <NA> so we have to ask ourselves do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good <unk> or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 469.24 479.31 <NA> and that is really why it becomes a bad project it 's not to say that if we had all the money in the world we wouldn 't want to do it <unk> but it 's to say <unk> when we don 't <unk> it 's just simply not our first priority
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 479.99 482.76 <NA> <unk> the fair projects notice i 'm not going to comment on all these
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 482.56 493.05 <NA> but communicable diseases scale of basic health services just made it simply because yes <unk> scale of basic health services is a great thing it would do a lot of good <unk> but it 's also very very costly again <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 493 500.02 <NA> what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation if you look at the good projects a lot of sanitation and water projects
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 501.45 503.14 <NA> <unk> water is incredibly important <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 503.14 515.35 <NA> but it also costs a lot of infrastructure so i 'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world <unk> the fourth best problem is
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 514.86 523.42 <NA> malaria dealing with malaria the incidence of malaria is about a couple of [ million ] people get infected every year <unk> it might even cost up towards a

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 529.74 539.9 <NA> over the next four years <unk> we could bring that incidence down to half we could avoid about five hundred thousand people dying <unk> but perhaps more importantly we could avoid about a [ million ] people getting infected <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 539.8 548.99 <NA> <unk> every year <unk> we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with of course <unk> in the long run also to deal with global warming

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 558.37 568.68 <NA> we could basically enliven the the global economy to to an astounding number of about two thousand four hundred billion dollars a year <unk> half of which would accrue to the third world <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 568.63 574.33 <NA> <unk> again the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 576 577.47 <NA> <unk> two to five years 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 577.28 587.53 <NA> that would be the third best thing we could do the second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition not just malnutrition in general but there 's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition namely <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 587.48 597.76 <NA> <unk> the lack of micronutrients basically about half of the world 's population is lacking in iron zinc iodine and vitamin a if we invest about twelve billion dollars we could make a severe <unk>

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 605.1 619.83 <NA> to focus on hiv aids <unk> basically if we invest twenty seven billion dollars over the next eight years <unk> we could avoid twenty eight new million cases of hiv aids again <unk> what this does and what it focuses on is saying
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 619.83 624.84 <NA> there are two very different ways that we can deal with hiv aids one is treatment the other one is prevention <unk>
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 625.52 631.94 <NA> <unk> and again in an ideal world we would do both but in a world where we don 't do either or don 't do it very well <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 631.72 646.39 <NA> we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first <unk> and treatment is much much more expensive than prevention so basically what this focuses on is saying we can do a lot more by investing in prevention basically for the amount of money that we spend 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 646.39 650.08 <NA> we can do x amount of good in treatment <unk> and ten times

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 651.41 656.45 <NA> prevention so again what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment at first rate <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 656.45 668.5 <NA> what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities i 'd like to have you look at your priority list and say <unk> did you get it right or did you get close to what we came up with here <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 668.1 674.99 <NA> well <unk> of course one of the things is climate change again <unk> i find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 675.19 680.57 <NA> <unk> we should also do climate change if for no other reason simply because it 's such a big problem <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 680.08 686.66 <NA> but of course we don 't do all problems <unk> there are many problems out there in the world and what i want to make
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 686.2 695.75 <NA> sure of is if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good <unk> and i think actually

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 725.91 735.53 <NA> <unk> when we talk about saving people or helping people in bangladesh in two thousand one hundred we 're not talking about a poor bangladeshi we 're actually talking about a fairly rich dutch guy <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 735.53 743.89 <NA> and so the real point of course is to say <unk> do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little one hundred years from now a fairly rich dutch guy <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 743.43 750.02 <NA> or do we want to help real poor people right now in bangladesh who really need the help and whom we
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 750 760.05 <NA> can help very very cheaply or as schelling put it imagine if you were a rich as you will be a rich chinese a rich bolivian a rich congolese in

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 781.25 790.77 <NA> so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight even if it doesn 't accord to the typical way we see this problem of course 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 790.77 794.64 <NA> that 's mainly because climate change has good pictures <unk> we have you know

BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 810.46 817.22 <NA> so in many ways i think of the copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems <unk> 
BjornLomborg_2005 1 BjornLomborg_2005 816.99 823.04 <NA> to make sure that we realize it 's not about making us feel good it 's not about making things
