MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 13.09 20.96 <NA> <unk> few weeks ago a friend of mine gave this toy car to his 8 year old son <unk> but instead of going into a store
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 20.53 29.61 <NA> and buying one like we do normally he went to this website and he downloaded a file <unk> and then he printed it on this printer
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 30.02 35.29 <NA> so this idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 35.11 40.68 <NA> is something that the economist magazine defined as the third industrial revolution 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 40.52 49.81 <NA> actually <unk> i argue that there is another revolution going on and it 's the one that has to do with open source hardware and the maker 's movement <unk> because
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 49.65 53.47 <NA> the printer that my friend used to print the toy
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 53.13 54.13 <NA> is actually
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 54.84 60.88 <NA> <unk> so you go to the same website you can download all the files that you need in order to make
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 60.71 67.81 <NA> that printer <unk> the construction files the hardware <unk> the software all the instruction is there 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 67.38 79.13 <NA> and also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers and there 's a lot of innovation happening because it 's all
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 79.96 83.51 <NA> <unk> don 't need anybody 's permission to create something great 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 83.11 97.01 <NA> and that space is like the personal computer in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six like the apples with the other companies are fighting and we will see in a few years there will be the apple of this kind of market come out well
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 97.21 99.08 <NA> there 's also another
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 98.62 100.05 <NA> interesting thing
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 100 109.76 <NA> i said the electronics are open source because at the heart of this printer there is something i 'm really attached to these arduino boards the motherboard that sort of powers this printer 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 109.77 115.69 <NA> is a project i 've been working on for the past seven years it 's an open source project i worked with
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 115.53 120.7 <NA> with these friends of mine that i have here so the five of us two americans two italians
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 120.52 124.99 <NA> and a spaniard we you know <unk> it 's a
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 126.24 127.72 <NA> <unk> so we came together
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 127.55 131.8 <NA> in this design institute called the interaction design institute ivrea <unk> 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 131.79 138.77 <NA> which was teaching interaction design this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 138.41 142.1 <NA> and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 142.1 152.21 <NA> well when you design an object that 's supposed to interact with a human being if you make a foam model of a mobile phone <unk> it doesn 't make any sense you have to have something that actually interacts
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 154.87 168.6 <NA> <unk> worked on arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use so that our students could just build things that worked but they don 't have five years to become an electronics engineer we have one month 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 168.6 178.77 <NA> so how do i make something that even a kid can use and actually with arduino we have kids like sylvia that you see here that actually make projects with arduino
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 179.72 183.6 <NA> <unk> kids stop me and show me stuff they built for arduino that 's
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 183.4 187.6 <NA> really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 187.6 197.13 <NA> the tools <unk> so let 's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly so one of the examples that i like to sort of kick off this
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 196.64 204.97 <NA> discussion is is this example of this cat feeder <unk> the gentleman who made this project had two cats one was sick and the other one was healthy
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 205.22 210.8 <NA> <unk> so he had to make sure they ate the proper food so he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 210.62 222.02 <NA> mounted inside on the collar of the cat and opens the door and the cat can eat the food this is made by recycling an old cd player that you can get from an old computer some cardboard tape 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 222.02 229.01 <NA> couple of sensors a few blinking leds and then suddenly you have a tool you build something that you cannot find on the market
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 229.9 238.88 <NA> <unk> like this phrase scratch your own itch if you have an idea you just go and you make it this is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 238.81 243.44 <NA> so one of the features that i think is important about our work is that
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 243.01 251.27 <NA> our hardware on top of being made with love in italy as you can see from the back of the circuit is that
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 251.26 254.97 <NA> it 's open <unk> so we publish all the design files
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 255.02 258.17 <NA> <unk> for the circuit online <unk> so you can download it
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 258.01 262.93 <NA> and you can actually use it to make something or to modify to learn you know 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 262.93 270.13 <NA> when i was learning about programming i learned by looking at other people 's code or looking at other people 's circuits in magazines and this is
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 269.95 279.73 <NA> a good way to learn by looking at other people 's work <unk> so the different elements of the project are all open so the hardware is released with a creative commons license
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 280.05 290.08 <NA> <unk> so you know i like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon like it was a song or a poem with creative commons 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 290.08 300.05 <NA> or the software is gpl so it 's open source as well <unk> the documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the creative commons
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 300 306.23 <NA> <unk> just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is arduino and what isn 't now
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 306.55 309.62 <NA> arduino itself is made of a lot of different
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 309.62 320.19 <NA> open source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a 12 year old kid <unk> so arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open source technologies
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 320.01 327.87 <NA> where we try to give them the best user experience to get something done quickly <unk> so you have situations like this where
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 327.66 329.88 <NA> some people in chile decided to make
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 329.87 335.46 <NA> <unk> their own boards instead of buying them to organize a workshop and to save money 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 335.24 346.23 <NA> or there are companies that make their own variations of arduino that fit in a certain market <unk> and there 's probably <unk> maybe like a one hundred and fifty of them or something at the moment 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 346.23 348.03 <NA> this one is made

MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 354.66 361.82 <NA> <unk> heroes of the open source hardware movement and the maker movement so this idea that you have a new sort of
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 362.91 370.72 <NA> diy community that believes in open source in collaboration <unk> collaborates online collaborates in different spaces 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 370.32 379.97 <NA> there is this magazine called make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community and you see a very technical project explained

MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 382.71 386.59 <NA> or you have websites like this one like instructables 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 386.6 395.7 <NA> where people actually teach each other about anything so this one is about arduino projects the page you see on the screen but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 395.47 397.76 <NA> and everything else so
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 397.57 404.61 <NA> let 's look at some projects <unk> so this one is a quadcopter <unk> it 's a small model helicopter in a way it 's a toy

MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 415.07 422.34 <NA> but then somebody actually launched this start up called matternet where they figured out that you could use this to actually
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 421.91 429.97 <NA> transport things from one village to another in africa and the fact that this was easy to find open source easy to hack enabled them
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 429.93 441.61 <NA> <unk> to prototype their company really quickly or other projects matt richardson i 'm getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on tv over and over and over again <unk> so i decided to do something about it 
MassimoBanzi_2012G 1 MassimoBanzi_2012G 441.18 447.02 <NA> this arduino project which i call the enough already will mute the tv anytime any of these
