DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 61.61 70.48 <NA> the problem was that i barely knew anything about <unk> 3d printing <unk> and i had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 70.71 79.82 <NA> i always felt most creative when i worked from home <unk> i loved experimenting with new materials and i always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique

DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 92.11 96.74 <NA> as you can probably imagine my roommates didn 't like that at all 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 96.4 104.97 <NA> so i decided to move on to working with big machines ones that didn 't fit in my living room i love the exact and the custom

DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 112.07 120.91 <NA> one summer break i came here to new york for an internship at a fashion house in chinatown we worked on two incredible dresses that were
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 122.12 124.6 <NA> they were amazing like you can see here
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 125.91 131.5 <NA> <unk> few issues with them they were made from hard plastics and that 's why they were very breakable 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 131.4 137.32 <NA> the models couldn 't sit in them and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 136.98 143.6 <NA> with 3d printing the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 143.6 152.33 <NA> but still they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 154.96 164.79 <NA> <unk> me a 3d printed necklace printed using a home printer i knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship <unk> 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 164.79 172.55 <NA> so i looked at the necklace <unk> and then i thought if i can print a necklace from home why not print my clothes from home too 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 172.66 179.97 <NA> i really liked the idea that i wouldn 't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell i could just design

DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 185.98 195.09 <NA> where i learned everything i know about 3d printing right away they literally gave me the key to the lab so i could experiment into the night <unk> every night 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 194.69 200.26 <NA> the main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with so what is a filament
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 200.22 209.29 <NA> <unk> filament is the material you feed the printer with and i spent a month or so experimenting with pla which is a hard and scratchy breakable material 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 209.1 219.37 <NA> the breakthrough came when i was introduced to filaflex which is a new kind of filament it 's strong <unk> yet very flexible and with it i was able to print the first <unk>
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 219.32 229.94 <NA> garment the red jacket that had the word libert freedom in french embedded into it <unk> i chose this word because i felt so empowered and free when i could just

DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 233.89 243.56 <NA> and actually you can easily download this jacket and easily change the word to something else for example your name or your sweetheart 's name 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 244.06 250.11 <NA> laughter so the printer plates are small so i had to piece the garment together just like
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 252.26 262.5 <NA> <unk> and i wanted to solve another challenge i wanted to print textiles that i would use just like regular fabrics that 's when i found an open source file from an architect who designed a pattern <unk>
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 262.4 268.86 <NA> <unk> that i love <unk> and with it i was able to print a beautiful textile that i would use just like a regular fabric

DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 279.2 286.72 <NA> and i needed to print another one thousand five hundred more hours to complete printing my collection <unk> 
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 286.72 289.51 <NA> so i brought six printers to my home and just printed <unk>
DanitPeleg_2015Y 1 DanitPeleg_2015Y 290.72 304.94 <NA> and this is actually a really slow process but let 's remember the internet was significantly slower twenty years ago so 3d printing will also accelerate and in no time you 'll be able to print a t shirt in your home in just a couple of hours
