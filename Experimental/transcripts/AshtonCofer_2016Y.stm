AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 41.78 48.18 <NA> flames were pouring out <unk> smoke was in the air and it looked like our wooden deck was about to catch fire <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 47.69 54.88 <NA> i immediately started yelling my mom was freaking out my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 54.81 58.21 <NA> <unk> sister started recording a snapchat video 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 59.31 63.49 <NA> this was just the beginning of my team 's science project <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 63 68.17 <NA> my team is composed of me and three other students who are here in the audience today <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 67.8 75.2 <NA> we competed in first lego league which is an international lego robotics competition for kids <unk> and in addition to a robotics
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 75.67 80.81 <NA> <unk> we also worked on a separate science project <unk> and this was the project that we were working on <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 80.38 92.03 <NA> so the idea for this project all started when a few months earlier a couple of my teammates took a trip to central america and saw beaches littered with styrofoam or expanded polystyrene foam 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 91.54 97.67 <NA> and when they came back and told us about it we really started thinking about the ways in which we see styrofoam every day 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 97.67 102.95 <NA> get a new <unk> flat screen tv you end up with a block of styrofoam bigger than the tv itself
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 102.46 104.88 <NA> <unk> drink a cup of coffee well those
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 104.81 107.64 <NA> <unk> styrofoam coffee cups are sure going to add up <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 107.27 110.94 <NA> and where do all these items go after their one time use 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 110.74 121.18 <NA> since there aren 't any good existing solutions for used styrofoam almost all of them end up right in the landfill or the oceans and beaches <unk> taking over five hundred years to degrade
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 121.18 127.39 <NA> <unk> and in fact <unk> every year the us alone produces over two billion pounds of styrofoam filling up a staggering
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 129.96 134.73 <NA> <unk> we have these ghost accumulations of styrofoam waste why can 't we just recycle them like
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 134.57 136.15 <NA> many plastics 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 136.15 145.67 <NA> well simply put recycled polystyrene is too expensive and potentially contaminated so there is very little market demand for styrofoam that has to be recycled 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 145.43 154.97 <NA> and as a result styrofoam is considered a nonrenewable material because it is neither feasible nor viable to recycle polystyrene <unk> and in fact many cities
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 154.99 165.41 <NA> <unk> across the us have even passed ordinances that simply ban the production of many products containing polystyrene which includes disposable utensils packing peanuts takeout containers <unk>
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 165.36 170.7 <NA> and even plastic beach toys all products that are very useful in today 's society <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 177.2 179.58 <NA> <unk> but what if we could keep using styrofoam
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 179.38 189.27 <NA> and keep benefiting from its cheap <unk> lightweight <unk> insulating and excellent packing ability <unk> while not having to suffer from the repercussions of having to dispose of it 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 188.81 192.72 <NA> what if we could turn it into something else that 's actually useful 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 192.35 195.93 <NA> what if we could make the impossible possible 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 195.89 204.94 <NA> my team hypothesized that we could use the carbon that 's already in styrofoam to create activated carbon which is used in almost every water filter today
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 205.07 212.68 <NA> <unk> and activated carbon works by using very small micropores to filter out contaminants from water or even air <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 212.34 216.04 <NA> so we started out by doing a variety of heating tests 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 215.58 222.16 <NA> and unfortunately we had many failures <unk> literally nothing worked <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 221.67 229.37 <NA> besides my dad 's grill catching on fire <unk> most of our samples vaporized into nothing or exploded inside expensive furnaces
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 230.04 236.48 <NA> a horribly sticky mess in fact <unk> we were so saddened by our failures that we almost gave up <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 236.83 244.31 <NA> so why did we keep trying when all the adults said it was impossible well <unk> maybe it 's because we 're kids we don 't know any better 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 244.27 252.99 <NA> but the truth is we kept trying because we thought it was still possible <unk> we knew that if we were successful we would be helping the environment and making the world a better place 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 252.99 254.43 <NA> so we kept trying
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 255.11 258.27 <NA> <unk> and failing and trying
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 258.08 262.32 <NA> and failing we were so ready to give up <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 262.13 264.18 <NA> but then it happened 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 263.72 272.94 <NA> with the right temperatures times and chemicals <unk> we finally got that successful test result showing us that we had created activated carbon from styrofoam waste <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 272.94 277.41 <NA> and at that moment the thing that had been impossible all of a sudden wasn 't 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 276.98 279.97 <NA> it showed us that although we had many failures at the beginning
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 280.07 283.87 <NA> were able to persevere through them to get the test results that we wanted 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 283.41 294.19 <NA> and moreover not only were we able to create activated carbon for purifying water but we were also able to reduce styrofoam waste <unk> solving two global problems with just one solution 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 293.82 299.96 <NA> so from then on we were inspired to take our project further <unk> performing more tests to make it more effective and testing it
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 306.58 312.62 <NA> <unk> sponsored by the us army as well as first global innovation awards sponsored by xprize 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 312.13 318.15 <NA> and we were also honored with the scientific american innovator award from google science fair
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 318.15 324.26 <NA> <unk> and using these funds we plan to file a full patent on our process and to continue to work on our project <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 326.87 333.69 <NA> <unk> with catching my dad 's grill on fire and failing so many times that we almost quit it was well worth it when we look back at it now 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 333.2 341.06 <NA> we took a problem that many people said was impossible and we made it possible <unk> and we persevered when it looked like nothing that we did would work 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 341.06 344.97 <NA> we learned that you can 't have success without a little 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 344.51 347.13 <NA> or a lot of failure <unk> 
AshtonCofer_2016Y 1 AshtonCofer_2016Y 346.94 354.76 <NA> so in the future don 't be afraid if your grill goes up in flames because you never know when your idea might just catch fire
