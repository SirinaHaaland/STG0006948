MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 170.35 179.76 <NA> the basic idea was these would be new school libraries for new york schools and so the idea is that it 's a new thing a new idea that needs a new name what i wanted to do

MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 240.01 252.81 <NA> <unk> option number three option number three was based actually on language it 's the idea that read is the past tense of read and they 're both spelled the same way so why don 't we call this place the red zone
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 254.72 260.13 <NA> <unk> red get red <unk> i 'm well red 
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 259.82 269.76 <NA> i really loved this idea and i somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and i don 't know 
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 271.52 272.73 <NA> but
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 272.84 275.05 <NA> sometimes cleverness is more important

MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 283.74 287.2 <NA> but in this case the question was more like um 
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 287.37 297.43 <NA> are you kidding because they said <unk> the premise of all this work was that kids were bored with old libraries musty old libraries they were tired of them <unk>
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 297.38 304.97 <NA> and instead they said <unk> these kids have never really seen a library the school libraries in these schools are really so dilapidated
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 305.08 312.83 <NA> <unk> if they 're there at all that they haven 't bored anyone <unk> they haven 't even been there to bore anyone at all <unk> so the idea was

MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 315.94 318.78 <NA> one last try a library
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 330.05 340.32 <NA> <unk> and there you have it the library initiative so i thought <unk> mission accomplished there 's your logo so what 's interesting about this logo an unintended consequence was that it turned out that they didn 't really even need my design <unk>
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 340.22 350.05 <NA> <unk> because you could type it any font you could write it by hand and when they started sending emails around they just would use shift and one they 'd get their own logo just right out of the thing
MichaelBierut_2017S 1 MichaelBierut_2017S 352.26 362.38 <NA> <unk> feel free to use that logo <unk> and then i embarked on the real rollout of this thing working with every one of the architects to put this logo on the front door of their own library right <unk>
