DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 24.67 29.97 <NA> <unk> 's deceptively large there 's actually only about twenty people on each page
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 30.07 34.77 <NA> because we have the name address and telephone number of every single person <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 34.76 40.86 <NA> and in fact everybody 's listed twice because it 's sorted once by name and once by email address
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 41.69 44.58 <NA> <unk> obviously a very small community <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 44.72 53.89 <NA> there were only two other dannys on the internet then i knew them both we didn 't all know each other but we all kind of trusted each other
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 54.87 63.97 <NA> <unk> and that that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network <unk> and there was a real sense that
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 63.6 72.38 <NA> we could depend on each other to do things so just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community let me tell you what it was like to
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 72.38 75.2 <NA> register a domain name in the early days
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 76.63 84.09 <NA> <unk> just so happened that i got to register the third domain name on the internet <unk> so i could have anything i wanted other than bbn com and
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 86.5 88.32 <NA> so i picked
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 89.41 97.7 <NA> but then i thought you know there 's a lot of really interesting names out there <unk> maybe i should register a few extras just just in case <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 97.57 99.99 <NA> and then i thought nah that wouldn 't
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 107.87 117.91 <NA> <unk> attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days and in fact it wasn 't just the people on the network 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 117.91 120.85 <NA> but it was actually kind of built into the protocols
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 120.67 129.55 <NA> of the internet itself so the basic idea of i p or internet protocol and the way that the the routing algorithm that used it
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 129.87 132.94 <NA> <unk> were fundamentally from each according
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 132.74 135.97 <NA> to their ability to each according to their need 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 135.75 146.62 <NA> and so if you had some extra bandwidth you 'd deliver a message for someone if they had some extra bandwidth they would deliver a message for you you 'd kind of depend on people to do that and that was
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 146.13 154.73 <NA> that was the building block it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 155.11 156.47 <NA> but
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 156.37 159.95 <NA> it obviously worked really well <unk> and
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 159.52 164.24 <NA> we all saw what happened with the internet it was incredibly successful 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 163.9 170.84 <NA> in fact <unk> it was so successful that there 's no way that these days you could make a book like this
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 172.27 175.05 <NA> <unk> my rough calculation is it would be about
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 175.58 177.15 <NA> <unk> miles thick 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 176.99 183.84 <NA> but of course you couldn 't do it because we don 't know the names of all the people with internet with internet or email addresses 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 183.41 189.97 <NA> and even if we did know their names i 'm pretty sure that they would not want their name <unk> address and telephone number
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 189.75 199.63 <NA> published to everyone so the fact is that there 's a lot of bad guys on the internet these days <unk> and so we dealt with that by making
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 206.43 216.28 <NA> <unk> little things that aren 't really the internet but are made out of the same building blocks <unk> but we 're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 216.18 225.11 <NA> and that means that it 's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen or certain kinds of deliberate attacks but even the mistakes
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 225.52 232.25 <NA> <unk> can be bad so for instance <unk> in all of asia recently <unk> it was
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 232.25 239.25 <NA> impossible to get youtube for a little while because pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring youtube
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 238.89 246.59 <NA> in its internal network they didn 't intend to screw up asia <unk> but they did because of the way that the protocols work 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 246.52 249.99 <NA> another example that may have affected many of you in this audience
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 250.49 258.9 <NA> <unk> you may remember a couple of years ago all the planes west of the mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in salt lake city
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 258.41 263.53 <NA> had a bug in it now <unk> you don 't really think that
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 263.35 268.78 <NA> our airplane system depends on the internet and in some sense it doesn 't i 'll come back to that later <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 268.78 274.42 <NA> but the fact is that people couldn 't take off because something was going wrong on the internet and the router card was
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 274.24 279.61 <NA> was down <unk> and so there are many of those things that start to happen
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 279.96 288.65 <NA> <unk> there was an interesting thing that happened last april all of a sudden a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole internet including
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 288.44 297.07 <NA> a lot of the traffic between u s military installations started getting re routed through china <unk> so for a few hours it all passed through china <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 297.06 299.93 <NA> now <unk> china telecom says it was just an
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 303.37 314.01 <NA> <unk> possible that it was the way things work <unk> but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they if they wanted to and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 314.01 317.22 <NA> imagine how vulnerable the system is to
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 317.02 326.46 <NA> deliberate attacks <unk> so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days they 're not going to do it with tanks
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 329.81 332.62 <NA> <unk> probably do is something very much like
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 332.38 343.25 <NA> the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility <unk> nobody has claimed credit for that there was basically a factory of industrial machines <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 343.25 349.84 <NA> it didn 't think of itself as being on the internet it thought of itself as being disconnected from the internet but it was possible for somebody to
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 350.79 358.87 <NA> <unk> drive in there or something like that and software got in there that causes the centrifuges in that case to actually destroy themselves 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 358.87 366.28 <NA> now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 366.33 372.29 <NA> and so there 's a lot of i 'm sure you 've read a lot in papers about worries about cyberattacks and
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 372.1 375.05 <NA> defenses against those but the fact is
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 375 384.62 <NA> people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet <unk> and there 's been surprisingly little attention to defending the internet itself as a communications medium
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 384.82 392.24 <NA> and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that because it 's actually kind of fragile <unk> so actually <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 391.84 398.36 <NA> in the early days back when it was the arpanet there were actually times there was a particular time it failed completely
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 398.08 404.94 <NA> because one single message processor actually got a bug in it and
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 404.9 407.65 <NA> <unk> the way the internet works is the routers
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 407.44 415.38 <NA> are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places <unk> and this one processor because of
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 415.38 424.89 <NA> a broken card decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time so in other words it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 426.6 430.96 <NA> <unk> the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy who would
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 430.96 437.62 <NA> send it back in time and get it there super early so every every message in the internet started
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 437.13 443.62 <NA> getting switched through this one node and of course that clogged everything up everything started breaking 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 443.34 448.24 <NA> the interesting thing was <unk> though <unk> that the sysadmins were able to fix it but
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 447.75 454.94 <NA> they they had to basically turn every single thing on the internet off now of course you couldn 't do that today i mean <unk> everything off
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 454.96 460.4 <NA> <unk> 's like the service call you get from the cable company except for the whole world 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 461.44 471.78 <NA> now <unk> in fact they couldn 't do it for a lot of reasons today one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the the internet right now <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 471.78 474.95 <NA> and so in fact we 're becoming dependent on it
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 474.55 478.01 <NA> for more and more different things like
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 478 479.31 <NA> when you take off from
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 479.93 485.19 <NA> <unk> really not thinking you 're using the internet <unk> when you pump gas you really don 't think you 're using the internet
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 485.24 491.77 <NA> what 's happening increasingly though is these systems are beginning to use the internet <unk> most of them aren 't based
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 491.59 500.17 <NA> on the internet yet but they 're starting to use the internet for service functions for administrative functions <unk> and so if you take something like the cell phone system
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 500.43 503.27 <NA> <unk> still relatively independent of the internet
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 503.09 507.89 <NA> for the most part internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 507.71 510.06 <NA> in terms of some of the control
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 509.9 519.71 <NA> and administrative functions and it 's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well they 're cheap they 're repeated and so on so all of our systems more and more 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 519.53 523.67 <NA> are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 523.67 529.97 <NA> and so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 529.99 538.52 <NA> <unk> to the other that 's crazy it was never designed to do things like that so we 've built this system where
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 538.03 547.88 <NA> we understand all the parts of it but we 're using it in a very very different way than we expected to use it and it 's gotten a very very different scale than it was designed for and
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 547.93 549.9 <NA> in fact nobody really
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 550 559.51 <NA> <unk> exactly understands all the things it 's being used for right now it 's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system where we 've designed all the parts
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 559.51 562.36 <NA> but nobody really exactly understands
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 561.88 568.05 <NA> how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 567.59 577.39 <NA> and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this or it does do this or it will do that you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 577.17 579.97 <NA> treat the comments of an economist about the
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 579.9 589.94 <NA> <unk> economy or a weatherman about the weather or something like that <unk> they have an informed opinion <unk> but it 's changing so quickly that even the experts don 't know exactly what 's going on <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 589.94 592.78 <NA> so if you see one of these maps of the internet <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 592.29 600.17 <NA> it 's just somebody 's guess <unk> nobody really knows what the internet is right now because it 's different than it was an hour ago <unk> it 's constantly changing
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 600.04 602.03 <NA> <unk> it 's constantly reconfiguring <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 601.87 609.65 <NA> and the problem with it is i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 609.19 612.54 <NA> where we take a system that 's basically
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 612.12 614.45 <NA> built on trust 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 614.62 622.37 <NA> was basically built for a smaller scale system and we 've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 622.06 624.93 <NA> and so right now i think it 's literally
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 626.39 630.18 <NA> <unk> that we don 't know what the consequences of an effective <unk>
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 631.1 632.15 <NA> <unk> attack
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 631.78 641.83 <NA> on the internet would be and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year and worse next year and so on but so what we need is a plan b there is no plan b right now there 's no
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 641.78 648.49 <NA> <unk> clear backup system that we 've very carefully kept to be independent of the internet <unk> made out of completely different sets of
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 655.04 663.19 <NA> but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet or the hospitals have to order fuel fuel oil this doesn 't need to be a <unk>
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 664.76 670.61 <NA> government project it 's actually relatively simple to do technically because it can use
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 670.61 679.97 <NA> existing fibers that are in the ground existing wireless infrastructure it 's basically a matter of deciding to do it but people won 't decide to do it
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 680.22 684.9 <NA> until they recognize the need for it and that 's the problem that we have right now <unk> so there 's
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 684.66 686.99 <NA> been plenty of people 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 687.01 698.18 <NA> plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years but it 's very hard to get people focused on plan b when plan a seems to be working
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 697.78 699.41 <NA> so well <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 704.15 710.09 <NA> <unk> starting to depend on the internet and how vulnerable it is we could get focused on
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 709.87 712.93 <NA> just wanting this other system to exist <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 712.93 723.3 <NA> and i think if enough people say yeah i would like to use it i 'd like to have such a system then it will get built it 's not that hard a problem it could definitely be done by people in this room <unk> 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 723.38 724.81 <NA> and so
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 725.28 734.2 <NA> <unk> i think that this is actually of all the problems you 're going to hear about at the conference this is probably one of the very easiest to fix 
DannyHillis_2013 1 DannyHillis_2013 733.74 737.63 <NA> so i 'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it <unk> thank you very much
