KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 193.37 199.59 <NA> the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 229.9 234.68 <NA> <unk> without regret but with it <unk> so let 's start off by defining some terms what is regret 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 235 243.33 <NA> regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 243.33 248.97 <NA> so in other words regret requires two things it requires first of all agency we had to make a decision in the first place 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 248.76 250.02 <NA> and second of all it requires
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 251.36 260.16 <NA> <unk> we need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice <unk> and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 260.69 268.33 <NA> and in fact the more we have of either of these things the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 268.33 270.87 <NA> the more acute that regret will be 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 271.13 273.48 <NA> so let 's say for instance that
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 273.11 279.88 <NA> you 're on your way to your best friend 's wedding and you 're trying to get to the airport and you 're stuck in terrible traffic and you finally arrive at your

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 290.88 299.77 <NA> well because if you miss your flight by three minutes it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 299.67 303.64 <NA> i should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel i should have gone through that yellow light

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 315.82 320.42 <NA> now within that framework we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 320.32 329.97 <NA> this session today is about behavioral economics and most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain <unk> we have a vast body of

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 365.34 373.61 <NA> others very high on our list of regrets include career romance parenting <unk> various decisions and choices about our sense of self

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 390.76 401.51 <NA> so in other words <unk> we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance but it turns out when you look overall at what people regret in life you know what our financial decisions don 't even rank 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 401.14 404.76 <NA> they account for less than three percent of our total regrets

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 419.72 426.96 <NA> but for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around what does that experience feel like
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 427.91 429.7 <NA> we all know the short answer
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 429.86 436.96 <NA> it feels terrible regret feels awful <unk> but it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 436.92 441.43 <NA> so the first consistent component of regret is basically denial 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 441.69 445.27 <NA> when i went home that night after getting my tattoo <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 445.08 453.13 <NA> i basically stayed up all night and for for the first several hours there was exactly one thought in my head and the thought was 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 453.27 454.88 <NA> make it go away
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 456.64 463.43 <NA> this is an unbelievably primitive emotional response <unk> i mean it 's right up there with i want my mommy 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 463.54 470.69 <NA> we 're not trying to solve the problem we 're not trying to understand how the problem came about we just want it to vanish <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 471.07 475.23 <NA> the second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 475.85 481.29 <NA> <unk> so the other thing i thought about there in my bedroom that night was how could i have done that 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 481.79 484.05 <NA> what was i thinking 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 484.31 492.9 <NA> this real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret <unk> we can 't identify with that part we don 't understand that part 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 492.56 503.5 <NA> and we certainly don 't have any empathy for that part which explains the third consistent component of regret <unk> which is an intense desire to punish ourselves that 's why in the face of our regret the thing we consistently say is i could have kicked myself
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 505.86 514.39 <NA> <unk> the fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative to perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 514.17 520.9 <NA> now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 520.56 524.69 <NA> so it 's not that i sat there in my bedroom that night 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 526 532.97 <NA> <unk> make it go away it 's that i sat there and i thought make it go away <unk> make it go away <unk> make it go away <unk> make it go away 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 534.46 540.17 <NA> so if you look at the psychological literature these are the four consistent defining components of regret <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 540.13 543.08 <NA> but i want to suggest that there 's also a fifth one 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 543.22 545.63 <NA> and i think of this as a kind of
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 545.53 549.78 <NA> existential wake up call that night in my

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 572.62 579.91 <NA> the whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 633.34 637.92 <NA> this is really hard <unk> because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 638.9 644.25 <NA> now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 649.73 654.97 <NA> the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 655.02 659.41 <NA> <unk> is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we 're feeling regretful about

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 674.34 678.92 <NA> is that even just with this one thing we can experience a huge range of regret
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 679.81 688.43 <NA> <unk> can accidentally hit reply all to an email and torpedo a relationship or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 840.73 842.96 <NA> 're going to be disappointed <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 842.62 850.49 <NA> because it 's actually not that hideous <unk> i didn 't tattoo marilyn manson 's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 850.42 854.91 <NA> when other people see my tattoo for the most part they like how it looks it
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 855.02 861.51 <NA> <unk> that i don 't like how it looks <unk> and as i said earlier i 'm a perfectionist <unk> but i 'll let you see it anyway

KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 870.56 875.02 <NA> i can guess what some of you are thinking <unk> so let me reassure you about
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 877.32 881.53 <NA> <unk> some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 883.5 888.46 <NA> i got this tattoo because i spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 888.06 895.81 <NA> and when i came and settled in new york afterward i was worried that i would forget some of the most important lessons that i learned during that time <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 895.59 900.31 <NA> specifically the two things i learned about myself that i most didn 't want to forget
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 899.97 903.01 <NA> was how important it felt to keep exploring
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 903.78 904.97 <NA> and simultaneously
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 905.14 908.9 <NA> <unk> how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 909.01 915.95 <NA> and what i loved about this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 915.79 919.55 <NA> and i thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 920.47 925.17 <NA> well it did but it turns out it doesn 't remind me
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 925.16 928.89 <NA> <unk> of the thing i thought it would it reminds me constantly of something else instead 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 929.03 937.53 <NA> it actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 937.52 943.86 <NA> and ironically i think it 's probably the single most important thing i possibly could have tattooed onto my body
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 943.37 946.92 <NA> partly as a writer but also just as a human being 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 948.05 949.74 <NA> here 's the thing 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 950.87 954.97 <NA> if we have goals and dreams
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 955.44 957.88 <NA> and we want to do our best 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 958.08 966.16 <NA> and if we love people and we don 't want to hurt them or lose them <unk> we should feel pain when things go wrong <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 966.87 974.62 <NA> the point isn 't to live without any regrets the point is to not hate ourselves for having them <unk> 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 975.15 979.58 <NA> the lesson that i ultimately learned from my tattoo and that i want to leave you with today
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 979.93 987.62 <NA> <unk> is this we need to learn to love the flawed imperfect things that we create
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 987.58 990.38 <NA> and to forgive ourselves for creating them 
KathrynSchulz_2011S 1 KathrynSchulz_2011S 990.88 997.83 <NA> regret doesn 't remind us that we did badly <unk> it reminds us that we know we can do better thank you
