DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 79.84 88.65 <NA> <unk> this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 88.41 98.72 <NA> we tend to view them and the popular press aids and abets this view as chemical imbalances in the brain <unk> as if the brain were some kind of bag of <unk>

DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 128.73 141.85 <NA> these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block

DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 172.41 174.72 <NA> 's just that we don 't tend to think about it that way <unk>
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 175.91 185.73 <NA> <unk> we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 185.63 195.03 <NA> now <unk> it 's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders it 's just that they don 't bathe the brain like soup <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 194.66 204.49 <NA> rather they 're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain

DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 276.63 286.75 <NA> <unk> in this way by doing this kind of test we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits <unk>

DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 309.61 321.89 <NA> but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states do these organisms even have emotion like states or are they just little digital robots <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 321.88 328.44 <NA> charles darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors as he wrote in

DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 333.08 343.89 <NA> and my eponymous colleague seymour benzer believed it as well seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila here at caltech in the ' 60s as a model organism <unk>

DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 360.57 371.11 <NA> so how do we ask this question it 's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like states <unk> but how do we actually find out whether that 's true or not 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 370.8 375.17 <NA> now in humans we often infer emotional states
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 379.78 382.67 <NA> <unk> 's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 386.25 399.17 <NA> it 's kind of like landing on mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out how do i find out if they have emotions or not 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 398.83 399.96 <NA> what can
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 401.39 402.93 <NA> <unk> 's not so easy 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 402.44 414.37 <NA> well one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 414.37 421.41 <NA> and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 421.22 424.72 <NA> so three important ones that i can think of are
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 426.18 429.34 <NA> <unk> gradations in intensity and valence 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 429.34 440.32 <NA> persistence means long lasting we all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 440.16 454.97 <NA> gradations of intensity means what it sounds like you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion if you 're a little bit unhappy <unk> the corners of your mouth turn down and you sniffle and if you 're very unhappy <unk> tears pour down
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 454.96 461.33 <NA> <unk> your face and you might sob valence means good or bad positive or negative <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 461.41 471.02 <NA> so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic <unk>
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 470.92 479.07 <NA> <unk> table you know the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away and it seems to keep getting irritated <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 480.13 491.61 <NA> a device which we call a <unk> puff o mat in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 491.18 500.02 <NA> and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puff o mat several puffs in a row they became somewhat hyperactive
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 500 507.43 <NA> <unk> and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to calm down <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 507.24 510.95 <NA> so we quantified this behavior using
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 510.56 519.04 <NA> custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator pietro perona who 's in the electrical engineering division here at caltech <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 519.03 525.02 <NA> and what this quantification showed us is that upon experiencing a train of these air puffs
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 525.16 534.68 <NA> <unk> the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent long lasting and also appears to be graded 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 534.46 541.13 <NA> more puffs <unk> or more intense puffs <unk> make the state last for a longer period of time 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 541.03 547.31 <NA> so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 547.06 554.97 <NA> so we decided to use our puff o mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 554.99 565.11 <NA> <unk> fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs <unk> and this is one of the great things about fruit flies <unk> there are repositories where you can <unk>
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 565.01 575.01 <NA> <unk> just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 579.72 584.29 <NA> <unk> longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 583.98 591.28 <NA> and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation <unk> it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 591.54 602.44 <NA> that 's right flies like people have dopamine and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and i have 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 602.19 604.97 <NA> dopamine plays a number of important functions
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 605.16 618.92 <NA> in the brain <unk> including in attention <unk> arousal <unk> reward <unk> and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse <unk> parkinson 's disease <unk> and adhd 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 619.72 629.91 <NA> now in genetics <unk> it 's a little counterintuitive <unk> we tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn 't happen when we take it away
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 629.9 640.2 <NA> <unk> by the opposite of what we see when we take it away <unk> so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the flies take longer to calm down from that we infer that the normal <unk>
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 640.1 646.72 <NA> <unk> function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 654.96 663.22 <NA> <unk> increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate dea license
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 666.87 675.17 <NA> we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do and that 's also reminiscent of
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 676.21 681.23 <NA> <unk> which is often treated with drugs like ritalin that act similarly to cocaine <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 680.77 692.03 <NA> so slowly i began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder now
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 691.69 702.69 <NA> how far does this analogy go as many of you know <unk> individuals afflicted with adhd also have learning disabilities is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 704.96 706.3 <NA> <unk> answer is yes <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 706.09 708.12 <NA> as seymour showed back in the
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 707.92 712.85 <NA> 1970s flies like songbirds as you just heard are capable of learning 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 712.86 724.87 <NA> you can train a fly to avoid an odor <unk> shown here in blue if you pair that odor with a shock then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 725.16 738.64 <NA> <unk> odor and another odor it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock <unk> well if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies they don 't learn their learning score is zero they flunk out of caltech
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 739.95 749.93 <NA> <unk> so that means that these flies have two abnormalities or phenotypes as we geneticists call them that one finds in
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 751.9 758.33 <NA> <unk> and learning disability <unk> now what 's the causal relationship if anything between these phenotypes 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 757.84 767.34 <NA> in adhd it 's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability <unk> the kids can 't sit still long enough to focus so they don 't learn <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 767.13 776.91 <NA> but it could equally be the case that it 's the learning disabilities that cause the hyperactivity <unk> because the kids can 't learn they look for other things to distract their attention <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 776.91 779.94 <NA> and a final possibility is that there 's no relationship
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 780.01 787.38 <NA> all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in adhd 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 787.38 793.54 <NA> now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans <unk> but in flies we can actually test this 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 793.31 800.23 <NA> and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 800.67 803.33 <NA> <unk> we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 803.15 813.23 <NA> and we genetically restore or cure the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 813.18 818.54 <NA> <unk> but in each fly we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 825 838.7 <NA> we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities <unk> if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex the flies are no longer hyperactive <unk> but they still can 't learn 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 838.27 847.94 <NA> on the other hand if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body the learning deficit is rescued the flies learn well <unk> but they 're still hyperactive 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 847.63 854.88 <NA> what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup <unk> rather <unk> it 's acting to
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 854.84 868.77 <NA> <unk> control two different functions on two different circuits so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain <unk> 
DavidAnderson_2013X 1 DavidAnderson_2013X 868.85 875.02 <NA> whether the same thing is true in adhd in humans we don 't know <unk> but these kinds of results should at
