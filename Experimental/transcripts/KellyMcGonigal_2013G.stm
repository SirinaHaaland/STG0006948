KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 80.5 85.94 <NA> let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 85.54 93.06 <NA> this study tracked thirty thousand adults in the united states for eight years and they started by asking people 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 93.06 96.59 <NA> how much stress have you experienced in the last year 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 96.58 102.78 <NA> they also asked do you believe that stress is harmful for your health
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 105.04 108.6 <NA> they used public death records to find out who died 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 108.74 110.19 <NA> okay
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 110.3 113.07 <NA> <unk> some bad news first <unk> 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 113.07 119.88 <NA> people who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a forty three percent increased risk of dying <unk> 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 120.11 121.8 <NA> but
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 121.4 127.93 <NA> that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 130.8 144.67 <NA> <unk> people who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die in fact they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study including people who had relatively little stress <unk> 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 144.48 154.97 <NA> now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths one hundred and eighty two thousand americans died prematurely not from stress but from the belief
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 154.98 157.13 <NA> that stress is bad for you

KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 161.44 164.66 <NA> now if that estimate is correct 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 164.49 170.93 <NA> that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the united states last year <unk> 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 170.93 175.14 <NA> killing more people than skin cancer hiv aids and homicide

KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 188.6 200.17 <NA> so this study got me wondering can changing how you think about stress make you healthier <unk> and here the science says yes when you change your mind about stress you can change your body
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 202.38 212.5 <NA> <unk> now to explain how this works <unk> i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out <unk> it 's called the social stress test <unk>

KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 294.87 304.94 <NA> so you get the idea <unk> if you were actually in this study you 'd probably be a little stressed out your heart might be pounding you might be breathing faster maybe breaking out into a sweat
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 305.01 312.95 <NA> and normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren 't coping very well with the pressure <unk> 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 312.73 321.02 <NA> but what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized was preparing you to meet this challenge <unk> 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 320.62 324.81 <NA> now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at

KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 350.43 355.84 <NA> <unk> but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed <unk> 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 355.44 363.04 <NA> now in a typical stress response <unk> your heart rate goes up <unk> and your blood vessels constrict like this
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 363.87 372.64 <NA> <unk> and this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease <unk> it 's not really healthy to be in this state all the time 
KellyMcGonigal_2013G 1 KellyMcGonigal_2013G 373.14 379.97 <NA> but in the study when participants viewed their stress response as helpful their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this
