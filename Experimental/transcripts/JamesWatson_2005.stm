JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 38.63 45.36 <NA> <unk> and why francis and i found it and then i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 45.5 50.08 <NA> makes me tick now in back of me is a picture
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 50 58.09 <NA> <unk> me when i was seventeen i was at the university of chicago in my third year and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 58.38 65.65 <NA> i was in my third year because the university of chicago let you in after two years of high school so you
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 66.84 70.48 <NA> it was fun to get away from high school because
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 70.65 76.27 <NA> i was very small and i was no good in sports or anything like that but i should say that
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 76.41 79.19 <NA> my background my father
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 79.81 88.73 <NA> <unk> raised to be an episcopalian and republican <unk> but after one year of college he became an atheist and a democrat and

JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 95.26 99.96 <NA> religion too seriously and by the age of eleven i was no longer

JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 118.28 122.19 <NA> and at the university of chicago i was a zoology major <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 121.88 128.86 <NA> and thought i would end up <unk> you know if i was bright enough maybe getting a ph d from cornell in ornithology
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 131.1 132.46 <NA> then
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 133.56 137.11 <NA> in the chicago paper there was a review of a book
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 137.73 141.07 <NA> called what is life by the great physicist schrodinger 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 140.82 148.69 <NA> and that of course had been a question i wanted to know you know darwin explained life after it got started but what was the essence of life 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 148.47 152.77 <NA> and schrodinger said the essence was information
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 153.36 154.97 <NA> present in our chromosomes
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 155.22 156.71 <NA> and it had to be present
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 158.17 165.98 <NA> on a molecule i 'd never really thought of molecules before you know chromosomes but this was a molecule and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 165.88 175.19 <NA> somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form <unk> and there was the big question of how did you copy the information 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 175.3 176.87 <NA> so
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 176.47 178.64 <NA> that was the book and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 178.3 179.97 <NA> so from that moment on
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 180.02 182.19 <NA> <unk> i wanted to
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 182.96 189.18 <NA> be a geneticist understand the gene and through that understand life <unk> so
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 189.53 198.15 <NA> i had you know a hero at a distance it wasn 't a baseball player it was linus pauling <unk> and so i applied to caltech and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 198.29 199.78 <NA> they turned me down
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 202.14 210.36 <NA> <unk> so i went to indiana which was actually as good as caltech in genetics and besides they had a really good basketball team so
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 210.37 214.96 <NA> i had a really quite happy life at indiana and it was at indiana
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 214.89 224.53 <NA> i got the impression that you know the gene was likely to be dna and so when i got my ph d i should go and search for dna <unk> so i first went to
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 224.22 226.6 <NA> copenhagen because
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 226.77 229.64 <NA> i thought well maybe i could become a biochemist
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 229.9 238.5 <NA> <unk> discovered biochemistry was very boring <unk> it wasn 't going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was it was just nuclear science and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 238.5 243.44 <NA> oh that 's the book little book you can read it in about two hours <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 243.31 247.04 <NA> but then i went to a meeting in italy <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 247.33 254.94 <NA> there was an unexpected speaker who wasn 't on the program <unk> and he talked about dna and this was maurice wilkins
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 254.99 260.56 <NA> <unk> was trained as a physicist and after the war he wanted to do biophysics and he picked dna because
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 260.38 269.37 <NA> dna had been determined at the rockefeller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes most people believed it was proteins but
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 269.09 273.27 <NA> wilkins you know thought dna was the best bet <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 272.96 274.93 <NA> he showed this x ray photograph
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 277.5 278.72 <NA> <unk> sort of crystalline 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 278.72 288.59 <NA> so dna had a structure even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions so there was something universal about the dna molecule <unk> so i
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 288.35 295.78 <NA> wanted to work with him but he didn 't want a former birdwatcher <unk> and i ended up in cambridge england so i went to cambridge because
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 296.04 298.88 <NA> it was really the best place in the world then for
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 304.87 313.32 <NA> <unk> those days it was the domain of the physicists <unk> so the best place for x ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at

JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 315.7 325.05 <NA> there i met francis crick i went there without knowing him he was thirty five i was twenty three and within
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 327.05 334.23 <NA> <unk> had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna not solve it like you know 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 336.08 339.48 <NA> in rigorous fashion <unk> but build a model
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 339.44 345.18 <NA> an electro model using some coordinates of you know length all that sort of stuff
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 344.72 352.42 <NA> from x ray photographs but just ask what the molecule how should it fold up and the reason for doing so
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 354.84 363.52 <NA> <unk> about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins <unk> and in doing so he banished the man out on the right <unk> sir lawrence bragg 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 363.12 366.44 <NA> who was the cavendish professor this is a photograph
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 366.26 372.38 <NA> several years later when bragg had cause to smile <unk> he certainly wasn 't smiling when i got there because he was
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 372.19 376.33 <NA> somewhat humiliated by pauling getting the alpha helix and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 375.84 378.37 <NA> the cambridge people failing
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 377.89 378.89 <NA> because they
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 380.44 381.98 <NA> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 381.73 387.47 <NA> certainly neither crick or i were chemists <unk> so we tried to build a model and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 387.7 389.03 <NA> he knew 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 388.66 397.8 <NA> francis knew wilkins so wilkins said he thought it was the helix x ray diagram he thought was comparable with the helix <unk> so we built a <unk> three stranded model 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 397.8 400.05 <NA> the people from london came up wilkins
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 403.1 409.95 <NA> <unk> possible collaborator rosalind franklin came up and sort of laughed at our model they said it was lousy and it was 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 410.03 416.28 <NA> so we were told to build no more models <unk> we were incompetent and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 417.11 425.17 <NA> so we didn 't build any models and francis sort of continued to work on proteins and basically i did nothing
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 430.62 432.67 <NA> <unk> reading is a good thing you get facts <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 432.66 441.73 <NA> and we kept telling the people in london that linus pauling 's going to move on to dna <unk> if dna is that important linus will know it he 'll build a model and then we 're going to be scooped and 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 441.36 449.56 <NA> in fact he 'd written the people in london could he see their x ray photograph and they had the wisdom to say no so he didn 't have it 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 449.56 452.75 <NA> but there was ones in the literature <unk> actually linus didn 't look at
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 455.23 456.59 <NA> <unk> about 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 457 466.2 <NA> oh fifteen months after i got to cambridge a rumor began to appear from linus pauling 's son who was in cambridge that his father was now working on dna <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 466.2 473.03 <NA> and so one day peter came in and he said he was peter pauling and he gave me a copy of his father 's manuscripts <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 472.54 473.82 <NA> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 473.65 474.87 <NA> boy i was scared
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 477.08 486.55 <NA> <unk> we may be scooped i have nothing to do no qualifications for anything and so there was the paper <unk> and he proposed
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 507.06 515.29 <NA> <unk> if the peak ph that cells have is around seven those hydrogen bonds couldn 't exist we rushed over to the chemistry department and said 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 515.29 519.22 <NA> could pauling be right and alex hust said no so
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 519.39 525.02 <NA> we were happy and you know we were still in the game
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 525.16 531.05 <NA> <unk> we were frightened that somebody at caltech would tell linus that he was wrong and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 530.71 536.69 <NA> so bragg said build models and a month after we got the pauling manuscript
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 537.49 546.77 <NA> i should say i took the manuscript to london and showed the people well i said linus was wrong and that we 're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models but
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 546.37 553.04 <NA> wilkins said no rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 552.85 554.7 <NA> he would start building models
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 555.19 561.99 <NA> so i came back with that news to cambridge and bragg said build models well of course i wanted to build models <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 561.56 570.3 <NA> there 's a picture of rosalind she really <unk> you know <unk> in one sense she was a chemist but really she would have been trained
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 569.84 576.24 <NA> she didn 't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry she was a crystallographer <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 576.05 579.28 <NA> i think part of the reason she didn 't want to build models was she wasn 't
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 580.13 583.84 <NA> chemist whereas pauling was a chemist <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 584.07 592.75 <NA> so crick and i <unk> you know started building models and i 'd learned a little chemistry but not enough well we got the answer on the 28th
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 592.53 599.69 <NA> february ' fifty three and it was because of a rule which to me is a very good rule never be the brightest person in
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 604.81 608.87 <NA> <unk> chemists in the room i went in and showed them a pairing i 'd done and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 609.55 619.76 <NA> jerry donohue he was a chemist he said it 's wrong you 've got the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place i just put them down like they were in the books he said they were wrong <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 619.66 625.05 <NA> so the next day you know after i thought well he might be right so i changed the locations
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 625 626.4 <NA> <unk> then we found
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 626.09 631.5 <NA> the base pairing and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 631.13 634.53 <NA> we knew we were right <unk> so
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 634.13 639.9 <NA> it was a pretty you know it all happened in about two hours 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 640.46 648.28 <NA> from nothing to thing and we knew it was big because <unk> you know <unk> if you just put a next to
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 648.09 649.99 <NA> t and g next to c you have a
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 671.64 674.83 <NA> <unk> you might as well believe it because you didn 't have any other scheme 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 676.98 679.88 <NA> but that 's not the way most scientists think
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 679.87 681.95 <NA> <unk> most scientists are really
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 681.79 686.24 <NA> rather dull they said we won 't think about it until we know it 's right but
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 686.5 692.81 <NA> you know we thought well it 's at least ninety five percent right or ninety nine percent right <unk> so think about it 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 693.4 699.65 <NA> the next five years there were essentially something like five references to our work in nature none <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 700.82 708.15 <NA> <unk> so we were left by ourselves and trying to do the last part of the trio how do you
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 708.77 712.35 <NA> what does this genetic information do 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 712.07 718.95 <NA> it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an rna molecule and then how do you go from rna to protein 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 718.73 724.56 <NA> for about three years we just i tried to solve the structure of rna it didn 't
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 724.11 725.11 <NA> yield
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 727.05 732.97 <NA> <unk> i was decidedly unhappy a girl didn 't marry me it was really you know sort of a shitty time 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 734.76 740.74 <NA> so there 's a picture of francis and i before i met the girl so i 'm still looking happy laughter
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 742.41 748.39 <NA> but there is what we did when we didn 't know where to go forward we formed a club
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 755.14 764.12 <NA> <unk> he designed the tie he was one of the members the question was how do you go from a four letter code to the 20 letter code of proteins <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 764.05 768.74 <NA> feynman was a member and teller and friends of gamow
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 769.33 774.78 <NA> but that 's the only no we were only photographed twice and on both
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 804.87 807.25 <NA> <unk> get happy until one thousand nine hundred and sixty 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 807.69 816.11 <NA> because then we found out basically <unk> you know <unk> that there are three forms of rna and we knew basically dna provides the information
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 839.95 847.58 <NA> <unk> that 's what chris wanted me to do it was so what happened since then well <unk> at that time
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 848.14 850.02 <NA> i should go back when we
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 850 852 <NA> found the structure of dna <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 852.41 861.54 <NA> i gave my first talk at cold spring harbor the physicist leo szilard he looked at me and said are you going to patent this and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 861.35 867.45 <NA> but he he knew patent law and that we couldn 't patent it because you couldn 't no use for it 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 868.79 876.22 <NA> and so dna didn 't become a useful molecule and the lawyers didn 't enter into the equation until
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 879.78 881.29 <NA> <unk> boyer and cohen
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 881.37 888.37 <NA> in san francisco and stanford came up with their method of recombinant dna and stanford patented it and made a lot of money <unk>

JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 892.83 897.13 <NA> then they learned how to read the letters for the code and <unk> boom we 've you know 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 898.29 900.23 <NA> had a biotech industry
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 903.52 910.7 <NA> <unk> were still a long ways from you know <unk> answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood which is 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 911.2 915.54 <NA> how do you nature nurture and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 915.32 916.43 <NA> so i 'll go on <unk>
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 917.56 925.07 <NA> <unk> time but this is michael wigler a very very clever mathematician turned physicist and he developed a technique which
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 926.12 937.02 <NA> <unk> will let us look at sample dna and eventually a million spots along it there 's a chip there a conventional one then there 's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 937.02 938.43 <NA> which is
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 938.66 941.68 <NA> way ahead of affymetrix <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 941.68 949.41 <NA> we use their technique <unk> and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 951 952.05 <NA> <unk> you can see
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 951.77 957.43 <NA> on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 957.27 964.39 <NA> so the dna is really badly mucked up whereas if you have a chance of surviving the dna isn 't so mucked up <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 964.05 971.99 <NA> so we think that this will eventually lead to what we call dna biopsies before you get treated for cancer you should really
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 971.81 975.11 <NA> look at this technique and get a feeling of

JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 979.38 988.71 <NA> i think it 's going to be very very useful so we started with breast cancer because there 's lots of money for it <unk> no government money and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 988.71 996.15 <NA> now i have a sort of vested interest i want to do it for prostate cancer <unk> so you know you aren 't treated if it 's not dangerous <unk>
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 997.99 1004.97 <NA> <unk> but wigler besides looking at cancer cells looked at normal cells and made a really sort of surprising observation

JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1012.73 1014.72 <NA> so we
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1014.62 1023.78 <NA> 're sort of all imperfect and the question is well <unk> if we 're around here <unk> you know <unk> these little losses or gains might not be too bad <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1023.32 1024.95 <NA> but if these
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1024.49 1028.32 <NA> deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene maybe
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1030.29 1035.43 <NA> <unk> so the first disease he looked at is autism <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1035.27 1046.41 <NA> the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it looking at an individual is about three thousand dollars and the parent of a child with asperger 's disease the high intelligence autism 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1045.95 1050.05 <NA> had sent his thing to a conventional company they didn 't do it
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1050.31 1053.8 <NA> <unk> couldn 't do it by conventional genetics but just scanning it
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1053.4 1061.75 <NA> we began to find genes for autism and you can see here there are a lot of them so
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1061.47 1066.31 <NA> a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of dna <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1066.3 1074.12 <NA> i mean big piece at the molecular level we saw one autistic kid about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1073.88 1078.92 <NA> we haven 't yet looked at the parents but the parents probably don 't have that loss or they wouldn 't be parents
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1079.93 1089.57 <NA> <unk> now so our autism study is just beginning we got three million dollars i think it will cost at least ten to twenty before
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1089.57 1096.17 <NA> you 'd be in a position to help parents who 've had an autistic child or think they may have an autistic child and can we
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1095.77 1099.9 <NA> spot the difference so this same technique should probably look at
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1101.72 1108.96 <NA> <unk> it 's a wonderful way to find genes <unk> and so i 'll conclude by saying we 've looked at twenty people with schizophrenia <unk> 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1109.01 1117.75 <NA> and we thought we 'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture but as you can see there 's seven out of twenty had a change which was
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1117.59 1125.08 <NA> very high and yet in the controls there were three so what 's the meaning of the controls were they crazy also and we didn 't know
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1128.88 1138.04 <NA> <unk> guess they 're normal <unk> and what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure <unk> and
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1138.69 1143.53 <NA> whether this is one that predisposes and then there 's only a <unk>
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1144.66 1149.57 <NA> <unk> of the population that 's capable of being schizophrenic now we don 't have
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1154.54 1157.7 <NA> <unk> to give you a hypothesis the best guess
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1158.47 1160.13 <NA> is that
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1159.85 1163.34 <NA> if you 're left handed you 're prone to schizophrenia 
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1163.45 1172.16 <NA> thirty percent of schizophrenic people are left handed and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics which means sixty percent of the people are
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1171.79 1178.41 <NA> genetically left handed but only half of it showed i don 't have the time to say now some people who think they
JamesWatson_2005 1 JamesWatson_2005 1183.02 1191.26 <NA> i 'm just saying that if you think oh i don 't carry a left handed gene so therefore my <unk> you know children won 't be at risk of schizophrenia you might
