PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 29.96 39.94 <NA> <unk> so hopefully this will be fascinating you can i can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there <unk> i thought i
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 39.94 44.07 <NA> 'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this and then
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 44.42 53.59 <NA> get john back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions you know i guess the first question is
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 54.89 62.72 <NA> build a virtual world at all <unk> and i think the answer to that is always going to be
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 62.48 68.23 <NA> at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 68.37 73.9 <NA> <unk> you know <unk> so i can give you a little bit of first background just on on me and what
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 73.62 79.97 <NA> what moved me as a really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult to actually try
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 79.99 84.76 <NA> <unk> and build this kind of thing i was a very creative kid
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 84.77 95.91 <NA> who read a lot and got into electronics first and then later programming computers when i was really young i was just always
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 95.7 99.92 <NA> trying to make things i was just obsessed with
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 99.67 102.74 <NA> taking things apart and building things and
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 102.7 104.97 <NA> just anything i could do with my hands or
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 104.96 111.19 <NA> <unk> with wood or electronics or metal or anything else <unk> and so for example and it 's a great second life thing
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 111.01 117.95 <NA> i had a bedroom and every kid you know as a teenager has got his bedroom he retreats to but i wanted my door

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 125 128.62 <NA> <unk> up in the ceiling and i cut through the ceiling joists
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 128.7 138.83 <NA> <unk> much to my parents ' delight and put the door <unk> you know <unk> being pulled up through the ceiling i built i put a garage door opener up in the attic
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 138.44 142.46 <NA> that would pull this door up you can imagine the amount of time

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 146.58 154.91 <NA> <unk> the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we 'd like to
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 154.87 163.19 <NA> <unk> do <unk> but are so often unable in the real world to actually do those things to actually

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 169.84 174.9 <NA> and so for me i know that when the internet came around and i was doing computer programming and
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 175.28 178.86 <NA> <unk> you know just generally trying to run my own little company and
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 178.88 185.53 <NA> figure out what to do with the internet and with computers i was just immediately struck by
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 185.53 196.08 <NA> how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the internet and with computers would be to use the internet and connected computers to simulate

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 213.12 224.93 <NA> and so for me that was the thing that was so enticing <unk> i just wanted this place where you could build things and so i think you see that in the genesis of what has happened
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 226.42 229.4 <NA> <unk> and i think it 's important i also think that
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 229.51 239.51 <NA> more generally <unk> the use of the internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 259.16 269.79 <NA> you know <unk> another way to look at that and related to the content and you know thinking about space is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space <unk> i thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second 
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 269.39 273 <NA> if you think about going into space

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 283.54 290.12 <NA> do we as people want to do that i think there 's a couple of things it 's what we see in the movies you know it 's

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 557.96 568.11 <NA> say i kind of think about the world as being information everything that we interact with all the experiences that we have is kind of us flowing through a sea of information and interacting with it in different ways

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 580.17 594.07 <NA> that 's one way of organizing information <unk> but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that i think are the important ways that they 're very different and much better than what we 've been able to do to date with the web 
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 594.03 597.4 <NA> the first is that as i said 
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 598.14 599.36 <NA> the
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 599.17 604.94 <NA> well <unk> the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 652.02 660.88 <NA> <unk> the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information and i think that 's something that people have talked about for twenty years you know that <unk>
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 662.06 669.67 <NA> that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us but the second thing and i think this one is less obvious
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 669.27 671.89 <NA> is that the

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 734.87 742.07 <NA> experience information together or want to experience it together is critical to essentially kind of
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 742.07 745.43 <NA> <unk> this trend of where we 're going to use technology to
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 745.24 754.94 <NA> to connect us <unk> and so i think again that it 's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 754.87 765.02 <NA> <unk> most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the internet if you will to be together to consume information
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 764.98 774.66 <NA> <unk> you know mapping in india that that 's such a great example maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time <unk> asking for advice 
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 774.66 779.91 <NA> rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 781.37 786.03 <NA> so i think that 's another big point i think that wherever this is all going 
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 785.72 795.93 <NA> whether it 's second life or its descendants or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points this is what we 're going to see the internet <unk>

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 804.96 813.1 <NA> <unk> information is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment 
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 812.7 815.24 <NA> big idea but i think
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 815.06 822.25 <NA> highly defensible <unk> so let me stop there and bring john back and maybe we can just have a

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 830.8 835.7 <NA> <unk> is the creation the impulse to create second life <unk> not a utopian

PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 853.88 864.45 <NA> the answer is no and i think the reason why is because the web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms up that idea of infinite possibility <unk> that magic <unk>
PhilipRosedale_2008P 1 PhilipRosedale_2008P 864.35 874.8 <NA> <unk> of anything can happen only happens in an environment where you really know that there 's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor at the level of the lego blocks <unk>
