SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 127.14 132.76 <NA> they told me that they preferred me on youtube than in person

SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 140.76 147.5 <NA> once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 147.34 154.97 <NA> the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it 's very unintuitive but when you think about it from their point of view it makes a
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 154.93 156.32 <NA> <unk> ton of sense 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 156.16 160.51 <NA> you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 160.52 170 <NA> without feeling like they 're wasting my time if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 170.08 175.08 <NA> <unk> they don 't have to be embarrassed and and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they 're bored

SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 185.54 195.03 <NA> <unk> the very first time that you 're trying to get your brain around a new concept <unk> the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 194.75 199.6 <NA> and that 's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they can just do it
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 199.2 200.2 <NA> in
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 205.26 209.89 <NA> <unk> the other thing that happened is i put them on youtube just just
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 210.03 216.61 <NA> i saw no reason to make it private so i i let other people watch it and then people started stumbling on it 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 216.61 225.02 <NA> and i started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of feedback from from random people around the world these are just a few
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 226.57 230.03 <NA> <unk> this is actually from one of the original calculus videos
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 229.66 236.42 <NA> someone wrote it on youtube it was a youtube comment first time i smiled doing a derivative 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 238.87 244.31 <NA> laughter let 's pause here <unk> this person did a derivative <unk> and then they smiled
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 244.27 250.14 <NA> in response to that same comment this is on the thread you can go on youtube and look at the comments
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 251.33 263.1 <NA> <unk> same thing here i actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day <unk> since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class and here i 'm all like ' i know kung fu ' 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 266.75 274.89 <NA> we get a lot of feedback along those lines this clearly was helping people but then as the viewership kept growing and kept growing 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 274.61 279.97 <NA> i started getting letters from from people and it was starting to become clear that it was more than
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 279.99 285.16 <NA> <unk> just a nice to have this is just an excerpt from one of one of those letters 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 284.79 289.52 <NA> my twelve year old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 289.34 296.56 <NA> we have tried everything <unk> viewed everything <unk> bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals <unk> and it got through 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 296.56 299.84 <NA> then we went on to the dreaded fractions again he got it <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 299.6 302.62 <NA> we could not believe it <unk> he is so excited 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 302.64 304.28 <NA> and so you can imagine
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 304.9 311.99 <NA> <unk> was an analyst at a hedge fund it was very strange for me to do something of social value 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 320.14 325.08 <NA> but i was excited so i kept going <unk> and then a few other
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 325.04 335.49 <NA> <unk> things started to dawn on me that not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who were sending letters <unk> but that this content will never grow old that it could help their kids <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 335.44 342.15 <NA> or their grandkids <unk> if isaac newton had done youtube videos on calculus 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 345.11 347.64 <NA> assuming he was good we don 't know 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 350.15 354.97 <NA> the other thing that happened and even at this point i said ok maybe it 's a good supplement it 's good for
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 354.93 358.45 <NA> <unk> motivated students it 's good for maybe home schoolers 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 358.32 363.89 <NA> but i didn 't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom then i started getting letters from teachers 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 363.89 374.08 <NA> and the teachers would write saying we 've used your videos to flip the classroom you 've given the lectures so now what we do and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 373.98 379.55 <NA> what i do is i assign the lectures for homework <unk> and what used to be homework
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 379.9 385.43 <NA> <unk> now have the students doing in the classroom and i want to pause here 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 389.38 395.39 <NA> i want to pause here because there 's a couple of interesting things one when those teachers are doing that <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 395.34 404.15 <NA> there 's the obvious benefit the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 404.75 411.15 <NA> <unk> time <unk> but the more interesting thing and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 412.16 416.91 <NA> <unk> lecture from the classroom <unk> and letting students have a self paced lecture at home <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 416.54 425.8 <NA> then when you go to the classroom letting them do work having the teacher walk around having the peers actually be able to interact with each other <unk> these teachers
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 425.63 429.34 <NA> have used technology to humanize the classroom
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 429.96 438.94 <NA> <unk> they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience thirty kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 439.91 441.83 <NA> this one size fits all lecture to thirty students
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 441.65 447.73 <NA> blank faces slightly antagonistic and now it 's a human experience now they 're actually interacting with each other <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 447.57 454.55 <NA> so once the khan academy i quit my job and we turned into a real organization we 're
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 455.8 462.95 <NA> a not for profit the question is how do we take this to the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 462.49 466.95 <NA> and so what i 'm showing over here these are actual
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 466.71 474.99 <NA> exercises that i started writing for my cousins <unk> the ones i started were much more primitive this is a more competent version of it <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 476.99 487.8 <NA> <unk> generate as many questions as you need <unk> until you get that concept <unk> until you get ten in a row and the khan academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don 't know how to do it <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 487.91 497.28 <NA> the paradigm here seems like a very simple thing ten in a row you move on <unk> but it 's fundamentally different than what 's happening in classrooms right right now in a traditional classroom <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 497.21 500.2 <NA> you have homework <unk> homework
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 501.06 510.37 <NA> <unk> you have a snapshot exam <unk> and that exam whether you get a seventy percent an eighty percent a ninety percent or a ninety five percent the class moves on to the next topic <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 509.97 521.41 <NA> and even that that ninety five percent student what was the five percent they didn 't know maybe they didn 't know what what happens when you raise something to the to the zeroth power <unk> then you build on that in the next concept that 's analogous to
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 520.92 523.01 <NA> imagine learning to ride a bicycle <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 524.73 529.97 <NA> <unk> maybe i give you a lecture ahead of time and i give you a bicycle for two weeks then i come back after two weeks
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 530.1 539.96 <NA> <unk> and say well let 's see you 're having trouble taking left turns you can 't quite stop you 're an eighty percent bicyclist so i put a big c stamp on your forehead 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 540.1 542.39 <NA> and then i say here 's a unicycle 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 542.92 544.1 <NA> but
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 543.67 550.28 <NA> as ridiculous as that sounds that 's exactly what 's happening in our in our classrooms right now and the idea is
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 550.28 554.97 <NA> you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden and start
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 555.49 565.59 <NA> calculus all of the sudden <unk> despite being smart despite having good teachers and it 's usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 565.37 574.96 <NA> learn math the way you 'd learn anything like riding a bicycle stay on that bicycle <unk> fall off that bicycle do it as long as necessary <unk> until you have
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 575.4 581.59 <NA> <unk> the traditional model <unk> it penalizes you for experimentation and failure <unk> but it does not expect mastery <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 581.13 586.45 <NA> we encourage you to experiment we encourage you to fail but we do expect mastery <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 587.37 594.04 <NA> this is just another one of the modules this is trigonometry <unk> this is shifting and reflecting functions 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 594.06 600.05 <NA> and they all fit together we have about ninety of these right now you can go to the site right now it 's all free not
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 600 601.43 <NA> <unk> trying to sell anything 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 600.94 604.26 <NA> but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 604.02 610.02 <NA> that top node right there that 's literally single digit addition it 's like one plus one is equal to two <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 610.02 615.63 <NA> the paradigm is once you get ten in a row on that it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 618.15 626.45 <NA> further down the knowledge map we 're getting into more advanced arithmetic <unk> further down you start getting into pre algebra and early algebra <unk> further down you start getting into
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 626.38 629.73 <NA> algebra one algebra two a little bit of precalculus
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 630.08 640.27 <NA> <unk> and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well <unk> everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 640.22 652.17 <NA> <unk> from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar <unk> you have genetics all based off of that core of if you know this and that now you 're ready for this next concept 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 655.04 661.93 <NA> and i encourage you to do it with your kids but i also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it 'll change what happens at the dinner table 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 661.77 668.9 <NA> but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 668.9 675.14 <NA> and so what i 'm showing you here this is data from a pilot in the los altos school district where they took two fifth grade classes
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 676.87 687.08 <NA> <unk> and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids aren 't using textbooks or getting one size fits all lectures they 're doing khan academy that software for roughly half of their math class <unk> i want <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 686.98 699.84 <NA> <unk> to be clear <unk> we don 't view this as a complete math education what it does is this is what 's happening in los altos it frees up time it 's the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to move through a system of equations <unk> and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 702.17 705.69 <NA> <unk> for the estimating how high that hill is based on its on its shadow <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 705.69 713.86 <NA> and so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day <unk> every kid works at their own pace this is actually a live dashboard from the los altos school district
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 713.5 715.24 <NA> and they look at this dashboard 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 715.24 724.99 <NA> every row is a student every column is one of those concepts green means the student 's already proficient blue means they 're working on it no need to worry <unk> red means they 're stuck <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 725.46 728.59 <NA> <unk> and what the teacher does is literally just say 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 728.39 738.46 <NA> let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 745.02 746.32 <NA> now 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 747.33 753.53 <NA> i come from a very <unk> data centric reality so we don 't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 754.93 756.66 <NA> <unk> you understand and all the rest 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 756.42 766.85 <NA> so our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible data that in any other field is expected <unk> in finance marketing manufacturing so the teachers can diagnose what 's wrong <unk>
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 766.75 774.84 <NA> <unk> with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to how long they 've spent each day what
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 775.82 786.42 <NA> <unk> when did they pause the videos <unk> what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they focused on the outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on the inner circle shows the videos they 're focused on
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 787.43 800.05 <NA> the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong red is wrong <unk> blue is right the leftmost question is the first one the student attempted they watched the video over there <unk> and you can see eventually
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 800.04 807.85 <NA> <unk> they were able to get ten in a row it 's almost like you can see them learning over those last ten problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 811.08 817 <NA> when you talk about self paced learning it makes sense for everyone in education speak differentiated learning 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 816.99 824.68 <NA> but it 's kind of crazy what happens when you see it in a classroom <unk> because every every time we 've done this in every classroom we 've done 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 824.94 829.88 <NA> over and over again if you go five days into it <unk> there 's a group of kids who 've raced ahead and a group
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 829.98 831.51 <NA> who are a little bit slower
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 831.51 840.86 <NA> in a traditional model in a snapshot assessment you say these are the gifted kids <unk> these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 840.55 845.31 <NA> but when you let students work at their own pace we see it over and over and over again
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 845.07 854.94 <NA> you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other <unk> but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 854.66 862.05 <NA> <unk> slow six weeks ago <unk> you now would think are gifted and we 're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 861.65 865.66 <NA> how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 865.44 868.56 <NA> were really just due to a coincidence of time
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 870.77 875.14 <NA> now as valuable as something like this is in a district like los altos
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 876.36 884.4 <NA> <unk> our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in los altos but on a global scale what 's happening in education and that that
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 884.41 893.9 <NA> brings up an interesting point <unk> a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 897.15 905 <NA> <unk> ratio <unk> so in a traditional model most of the teacher 's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot maybe five percent of their time is sitting next
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 904.99 906.89 <NA> <unk> to students and working with them 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 906.52 912.25 <NA> now one hundred percent of their time is so once again using technology not just flipping the classroom <unk> 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 912.26 917.09 <NA> you 're humanizing the classroom i 'd argue by a factor of five or ten
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 916.99 924.96 <NA> as valuable as that is in los altos imagine what it does to the adult learner who 's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff they should have known before before going back to
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 926.48 928.74 <NA> <unk> imagine what it does to

SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 931.31 944.37 <NA> who has to help his family during the day and that 's the reason he or she can 't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don 't know 
SalmanKhan_2011 1 SalmanKhan_2011 943.94 948.93 <NA> now imagine what happens where we talked about the peers teaching each other
