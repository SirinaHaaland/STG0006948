GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 12.76 17.28 <NA> <unk> going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option <unk> which would you <unk> choose grilled or fried chicken 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 17.28 25.19 <NA> now most people would answer grilled and it 's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories <unk> however grilled chicken poses a hidden danger 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 24.79 29.67 <NA> the hidden danger is heterocyclic amines specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine or
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 32.39 35.55 <NA> laughter which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 35.55 42.63 <NA> a carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells which can also cause them to metastasize or spread <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 42.14 49.89 <NA> they are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 49.46 53.77 <NA> studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 54.96 57.58 <NA> <unk> exist yet that show how or why 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 57.3 67.63 <NA> these here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens and as you can see <unk> none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet now you might wonder <unk>
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 67.53 75.17 <NA> <unk> how a thirteen year old girl could come up with this idea and i was led to it through a series of events i first learned about it through a lawsuit i read about in my doctor 's office
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 78.79 89.22 <NA> <unk> the physician 's committee for responsible medicine and seven different fast food restaurants they weren 't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken <unk> but they were sued because of california 's proposition sixty five
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 89.22 94.67 <NA> which stated that if there 's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 105.13 109.73 <NA> <unk> and i noticed that the edges of the chicken <unk> which had been marinated in lemon juice <unk> turned white 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 109.74 118.65 <NA> and later in biology class i learned that it 's due to a process called denaturing <unk> which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 118.16 124.9 <NA> so i combined these two ideas and i formulated a hypothesis <unk> saying that could possibly the carcinogens be
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 126.21 128.81 <NA> <unk> and could it be due to the differences in ph 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 128.6 134.18 <NA> so my idea was born and i had the project set up and a hypothesis <unk> so what was my next step well
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 133.97 140.06 <NA> obviously i had to find a lab to work at because i didn 't have the equipment in my school <unk> <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 139.85 148.76 <NA> i thought this would be easy <unk> but i emailed about two hundred different people within a five hour radius of where i lived <unk> and i got one positive response that said that they could work with me 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 148.76 154.46 <NA> most of the others either never responded back <unk> said they didn 't have the time or didn 't have the equipment and couldn 't help me
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 155.04 157.4 <NA> it was a big commitment to drive
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 156.91 163.61 <NA> to the lab to work multiple times however it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab so i could finally start my project 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 163.61 173.06 <NA> the first stage was completed at home <unk> which consisted of marinating the chicken <unk> grilling the chicken <unk> amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 172.6 179.97 <NA> the second stage was completed at the penn state university main campus lab <unk> which is where i extracted the chemicals changed the ph so i could
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 179.93 184.32 <NA> <unk> run it through the equipment and separated the compounds i needed from the rest of the chicken <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 184.1 191.58 <NA> the final stages when i ran the samples through a <unk> high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 191.3 198.42 <NA> which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens i had in my chicken <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 198.17 199.54 <NA> so
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 200.49 210.97 <NA> <unk> had very surprising results because i found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation <unk> when compared with the unmarinated chicken which is what i used as my control 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 210.97 217.36 <NA> i found that lemon juice worked by far the best <unk> which decreased the carcinogens by about ninety eight percent 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 217.53 224.74 <NA> the saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well decreasing the carcinogens by about sixty percent 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 227.89 237.38 <NA> <unk> but it was nearly negligible and the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 237.38 245.52 <NA> another important factor that i didn 't take into account initially was the time cooked <unk> and i found that if you increase the time cooked the amount of carcinogens
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 245.31 250.08 <NA> rapidly increases so the best way to marinate chicken <unk> based on this is to
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 251.21 257.31 <NA> <unk> but definitely don 't over cook and char the chicken <unk> and marinate in either lemon juice brown sugar or saltwater 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 263.54 266.85 <NA> based on these findings i have a question for you 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 266.39 274.93 <NA> would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life now i 'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that 's not marinated you 're definitely going to catch
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 276.84 285.47 <NA> <unk> anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle is it worth it to you how will you cook your chicken

GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 330.77 341.19 <NA> project it got a bit more complicated from there my older brother panaki bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when i barely understood basic algebra 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 341.18 347.22 <NA> my parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects including a remote controlled garbage can 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 347.87 354.85 <NA> and then came the summer after my freshman year when my grandfather passed away due to cancer and i
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 354.78 361.81 <NA> <unk> remember watching my family go through that and thinking that i never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 361.53 367.85 <NA> so armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology <unk> i decided
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 367.68 370.24 <NA> i wanted to do cancer research
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 370.02 379.97 <NA> at fifteen good plan <unk> so i started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab got rejected
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 380.22 388.43 <NA> by all except one and then went on my next summer to work under dr basu at the unt health center at fort worth texas <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 388.43 391.43 <NA> and that is where the research began 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 391.48 399 <NA> so ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don 't know about or at least don 't pay that much attention to 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 399 404.97 <NA> but yet it 's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the united states
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 405.01 411.22 <NA> in fact one in seventy women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer one in one hundred
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 411.01 412.59 <NA> will die from it 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 412.43 422.1 <NA> chemotherapy one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today <unk> involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 423.44 429.88 <NA> <unk> a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug a relatively simple molecule made in

GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 436.26 445.93 <NA> but here 's the problem <unk> sometimes patients become resistant to the drug <unk> and then years after they 've been declared to be cancer free they come back <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 445.47 449.9 <NA> and this time they no longer respond to the drug <unk> it 's a huge
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 450.79 454.1 <NA> <unk> it 's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 454.36 460.82 <NA> so we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called cisplatin 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 460.54 467.93 <NA> and we wanted to figure this out because if we could figure that out then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 467.86 474.9 <NA> so that 's what we set out to do and we thought it had something to do with this protein called amp kinase an energy protein <unk>
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 475.97 485.83 <NA> <unk> we ran all of these tests blocking the protein and we saw this huge shift i mean on the slide you can see that on our sensitive side these cells that are responding to the drug <unk>

GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 498.29 504.91 <NA> interesting but those are dots on a screen for you what exactly does that mean well basically that means that
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 505.05 510.53 <NA> <unk> protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell and in fact
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 510.53 516.28 <NA> it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 515.79 517.36 <NA> and that 's
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 516.96 518.59 <NA> huge 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 518.16 527.53 <NA> in fact it means that if a patient comes in and they 're resistant to this drug <unk> then if we give them a chemical to block this protein then we can treat them again
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 527.31 528.98 <NA> with the same drug
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 529.9 536.24 <NA> <unk> and that 's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness possibly for many different types of cancer <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 536.08 545.15 <NA> so that was my work and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research with figuring out exactly what this protein does 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 545.15 550.26 <NA> but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness so maybe all grandfathers
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 550.67 555.82 <NA> <unk> with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren <unk> but my work

GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 586.1 595.29 <NA> it was about making my own opportunities when i didn 't even know what i was doing <unk> it was about inspiration and determination and
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 595.29 602.03 <NA> never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing after all my story
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 601.8 604.97 <NA> begins with a dried <unk> withered spinach plant and

GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 620.38 628.56 <NA> hi everyone <unk> i 'm naomi shah and today i 'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 629.78 632.92 <NA> <unk> point six million deaths worldwide 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 632.68 635.83 <NA> one death every twenty seconds 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 635.59 639.48 <NA> people spend over ninety percent of their lives indoors <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 639.48 648.03 <NA> and the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of hiv and tuberculosis combined now these statistics had a huge impact on me 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 647.57 654.28 <NA> but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 654.99 660.46 <NA> it confused me why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 660.39 666.58 <NA> with this question in mind i started researching and i soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 666.12 672.74 <NA> as soon as i realized this i investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 672.58 674.81 <NA> and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 675.91 684.05 <NA> <unk> at first i just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 684.05 695.03 <NA> but soon after i developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 694.93 704.97 <NA> and it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health <unk> because that relationship seems so important
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 705.83 710.42 <NA> so with that in mind <unk> i started researching more i started investigating more
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 710.26 721.11 <NA> and i became very passionate because i i realized that if we could find a way to target remediation we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 720.95 724.99 <NA> for example volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 725 728.95 <NA> <unk> that are found in our schools homes and workplaces they 're everywhere 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 729.18 737.14 <NA> these chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant as defined by the u s clean air act <unk> which is surprising to me 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 736.65 746.56 <NA> because these chemical pollutants through my research <unk> i show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 746.31 751.07 <NA> so today i want to show you my interactive software model that i created
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 754.93 758.34 <NA> <unk> in the audience today julie and
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 758.1 764.04 <NA> all of julie 's data has been pre entered into my interactive software model and this can be used by anyone 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 763.8 771.42 <NA> so i want you to imagine that you 're in julie 's shoes or someone who 's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 771.42 775.28 <NA> so julie 's going to her doctor 's office to get treated for her asthma <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 774.85 779.91 <NA> and the doctor has her sit down and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 779.92 784.99 <NA> which is essentially her exhalation rate or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 784.78 796.63 <NA> so that peak expiratory flow rate i 've entered it up into the interactive software model i 've also entered in her age her gender and her height <unk> i 've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 796.63 800.17 <NA> so any user can come in here and click on lung function
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 800.7 806.39 <NA> <unk> and it 'll take them to this report that i created <unk> and this report really drives home the crux of my research <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 806.15 814.36 <NA> so what it shows if you want to focus on that top graph in the <unk> right hand corner it shows julie 's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 814.36 817.3 <NA> this is the measurement that she took in her doctor 's office 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 816.93 827.41 <NA> in the blue bar at the bottom of the graph it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate what her exhalation rate or lung health should be based on her age gender and height <unk> 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 827.13 829.97 <NA> so the doctor sees this difference between the yellow
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 830.02 836.06 <NA> <unk> bar and the blue bar and he says wow we need to give her steroids medication and inhalers 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 836.2 841.95 <NA> but i want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 841.71 849.99 <NA> inhalers and medication the doctor turns to julie and says why don 't you go home and clean out your air filters clean out the air ducts in your home 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 850 859.29 <NA> <unk> in your workplace in your school <unk> stop the use of incense and candles and if you 're remodeling your house take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring 
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 859.04 869.46 <NA> because these solutions are natural these solutions are sustainable and these solutions are long term investments long term investments that we 're making for our generation <unk>
GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 1 GoogleScienceFairWinners_2011X 869.36 874.93 <NA> <unk> and for future generations <unk> because these environmental solutions that julie can make in
