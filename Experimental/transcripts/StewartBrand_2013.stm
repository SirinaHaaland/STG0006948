StewartBrand_2013 1 StewartBrand_2013 309.37 314.4 <NA> points out that there 's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair the

StewartBrand_2013 1 StewartBrand_2013 413.39 427.35 <NA> another direct result was a young grad student named ben novak who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was fourteen and had also learned how to work with ancient dna <unk> himself sequenced the passenger pigeon <unk> 
StewartBrand_2013 1 StewartBrand_2013 426.98 429.58 <NA> using money from his family and friends

StewartBrand_2013 1 StewartBrand_2013 440.6 449.96 <NA> so if he 's successful she won 't be the last the third result of the boston meeting was the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of

StewartBrand_2013 1 StewartBrand_2013 506.61 513.97 <NA> so what they 're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive hardy looking cattle like that maremmana primitivo on the top there
