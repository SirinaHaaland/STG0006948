MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 17.22 24.41 <NA> but modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material in the form of telephone wire
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 24.13 29.19 <NA> rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 30.14 32.49 <NA> <unk> to replace hard to come by
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 32.03 36.9 <NA> natural grasses so here you can see the change from use starting to use
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 36.7 38.36 <NA> contemporary materials
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 38.2 47.88 <NA> these pieces date back from the fortys to the late fiftys in the <unk> ninetys my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 47.88 50.88 <NA> which came from a squatter camp outside durban
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 50.57 54.76 <NA> and i got the opportunity to start working with this community
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 54.9 62.14 <NA> <unk> at that point and started developing really and mentoring them in terms of scale in terms of the design and
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 62.46 67.07 <NA> and the project soon grew from five to fifty weavers in about a year
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 67.07 75.11 <NA> soon we had outgrown the scrap yards what they could provide so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us and not
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 75.1 80.51 <NA> <unk> only to supply the materials on bobbins but to produce to our color specifications
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 80.26 89.69 <NA> at the same time i was thinking well there 's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products away from the ethnic a little bit more contemporary
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 89.46 93.69 <NA> so i developed a whole range around mass produced range
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 93.51 101.25 <NA> that obviously fitted into a much higher end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 101.25 104.94 <NA> we started experimenting as you can see in terms of shapes
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 105.16 110.64 <NA> forms the scale became very important and it 's
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 110.63 115.92 <NA> become our pet project it 's successful it 's been running for twelve years and
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 115.49 120.9 <NA> we supply the conran shops and donna karan and so it 's kind of great
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 120.56 129.88 <NA> this is our group our main group of weavers they come on a weekly basis to durban they all have bank accounts they 've all moved back to the rural area where they came from
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 129.99 132.04 <NA> <unk> 's a weekly turnaround of production
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 1 MarisaFickJordan_2007G2 131.7 141.25 <NA> this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of and that 's also modernized today and it 's supporting work for three hundred weavers
