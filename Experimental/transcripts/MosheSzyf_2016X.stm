MosheSzyf_2016X 1 MosheSzyf_2016X 857.05 864.69 <NA> what did we learn about dna dna is not just a sequence of letters <unk> it 's not just a script

MosheSzyf_2016X 1 MosheSzyf_2016X 927.56 936.97 <NA> one layer of information is old <unk> evolved from millions of years of evolution <unk> it is fixed
MosheSzyf_2016X 1 MosheSzyf_2016X 936.73 944.55 <NA> and very hard to change <unk> the other layer of information is the epigenetic layer which is
MosheSzyf_2016X 1 MosheSzyf_2016X 944.09 946.62 <NA> open and dynamic
MosheSzyf_2016X 1 MosheSzyf_2016X 946.64 949.63 <NA> and sets up a narrative that is
MosheSzyf_2016X 1 MosheSzyf_2016X 955.02 962.83 <NA> <unk> to control to a large extent our destiny to help the destiny of our children
