EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 34.84 36.69 <NA> make light <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 36.62 42.15 <NA> i 've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 41.75 49.2 <NA> i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs <unk>

EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 53.57 54.97 <NA> but mostly
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 55.01 57.13 <NA> i 'm entranced by it <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 56.79 67.33 <NA> since my my first dive in a deep diving submersible when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays <unk> i 've been a bioluminescence junky <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 67.23 75.2 <NA> but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words <unk> and they were totally
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 75 76.76 <NA> <unk> totally inadequate to the task <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 76.76 86.22 <NA> i needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep rover 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 86.01 95.97 <NA> this next video clip you 're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence and the first thing you 're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 104.75 111.6 <NA> <unk> switched off it is possible to see their bioluminescence the light produced when they collide with the mesh
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 117.17 120.52 <NA> <unk> this is the first time it has ever been recorded
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 133.38 143.91 <NA> <unk> so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark adapted human eye <unk> which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 143.91 148.58 <NA> but just to try to prove that fact to you i 've brought along some bioluminescent plankton
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 148.37 152.33 <NA> in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 155.02 160.82 <NA> if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible i have a flask
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 160.54 163.8 <NA> that has bioluminescent plankton in it
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 163.8 169.67 <NA> <unk> and you 'll note there 's no light coming from them right now either because they 're dead 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 171.31 174.93 <NA> or because i need to stir them up in some way for you to
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 193.13 197.01 <NA> <unk> spend most of my time working in the dark i 'm used to that okay <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 198.2 199.72 <NA> so that
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 206.97 209.24 <NA> <unk> alga need to be able to produce light <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 209.24 220.18 <NA> well it uses it to defend itself from its predators the flash is like a scream for help it 's what 's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 219.69 225.05 <NA> it 's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder <unk> thereby either leading
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 225 228.3 <NA> <unk> to his capture or scaring him away there 's
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 228.3 239.42 <NA> a lot of animals that use this trick for example this black dragonfish <unk> it 's got a light organ under its eye it 's got a chin barbel <unk> it 's got a lot of other light organs you can 't see but you 'll see in here in a minute <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 238.99 240.5 <NA> so
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 240.55 250.05 <NA> we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime because the top speed of this fish is one knot which was the top speed of the submersible <unk> but it was worth
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 250.22 255.58 <NA> <unk> because we caught it in a special capture device brought it up into the lab on the ship <unk> and then
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 255.37 266.98 <NA> everything on this fish lights up it 's unbelievable the light organs under the eyes are flashing that chin barbel is flashing it 's got light organs on its belly that are flashing fin lights
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 266.98 272.1 <NA> it 's a scream for help it 's meant to attract attention <unk> it 's phenomenal
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 271.67 277.32 <NA> <unk> and you normally don 't get to see this because we 've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 278.33 279.82 <NA> there 's other ways you can
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 280.08 283.78 <NA> <unk> yourself with light <unk> for example this shrimp
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 283.29 292.48 <NA> releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud <unk> this blinds or distracts the predator <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 292.11 302.24 <NA> this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this now it may look like a tasty morsel or a pig 's head with wings
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 305.32 309.14 <NA> <unk> but if it 's attacked <unk> it
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 308.77 313.97 <NA> puts out a barrage of light in fact a barrage of photon torpedoes i
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 314.89 323.09 <NA> just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 323.26 324.5 <NA> it 's
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 327.98 337.89 <NA> <unk> there 's a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 337.89 344.89 <NA> but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean that 's where things get really strange and some of these animals
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 344.53 351.48 <NA> are probably inspiration for the things you saw in avatar but you don 't have to travel to pandora to see them 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 351.05 354.97 <NA> they 're things like this this is a golden coral a bush
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 355.16 365.05 <NA> grows very slowly in fact it 's thought that some of these are as much as three thousand years old <unk> which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 364.74 369.34 <NA> the other reason is this amazing bush glows <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 369.09 375.11 <NA> so if you brush up against it <unk> any place you brushed against it you get this twinkling
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 376.27 377.39 <NA> <unk> that 's just
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 377.22 378.98 <NA> breathtaking <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 378.76 388.05 <NA> and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing and
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 387.66 397.76 <NA> these are flytrap anemones <unk> now if you poke it <unk> it pulls in its tentacles <unk> but if you keep poking it it starts to produce light <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 397.33 400.08 <NA> and it actually ends up looking like
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 402.26 407.31 <NA> <unk> it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 407.48 415.8 <NA> there are starfish that can make light <unk> and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 416.09 424.8 <NA> this looks like a plant <unk> but it 's actually an animal <unk> and it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 425.43 436 <NA> <unk> it can actually hold itself in very strong currents as you see here <unk> but if we collect it very gently and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock <unk> it produces <unk>
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 435.9 444.22 <NA> <unk> this light that propagates from stem to the plume <unk> changing color as it goes from green to blue 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 445.83 449.89 <NA> colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 451.53 454.79 <NA> but we have no idea why it does that here
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 454.81 467.15 <NA> <unk> another one this is also a sea pen it 's got a brittle star hitching a ride <unk> it 's a green saber of light <unk> and like the one you just saw it can produce these as bands of light so if i squeeze the base 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 467.05 470.09 <NA> the bands go from base to tip 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 471.1 474.62 <NA> if i squeeze the tip they go from tip to base
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 476.77 479.91 <NA> so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 483.65 487.68 <NA> i 'd be very interested in your theories about what that 's about 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 488.27 498.22 <NA> so there 's a language of light in the deep ocean <unk> and we 're just beginning to understand it <unk> and one way we 're going about that is we 're imitating a lot of these displays <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 498.22 499.96 <NA> this is an optical lure that i 've used
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 500.22 510.49 <NA> <unk> we call it the electronic jellyfish it 's just sixteen blue leds that we can program to do different types of displays <unk> and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye in the sea that uses far red <unk>
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 510.39 519.8 <NA> <unk> light that 's invisible to most animals so it 's unobtrusive so i just want to show you some of the responses we 've elicited from animals in the deep sea <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 530.08 540.38 <NA> <unk> it <unk> and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish <unk> and when it starts flashing it 's just going to be one of the leds that 's flashing very fast <unk> but as soon as it starts <unk>
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 540.28 550.05 <NA> <unk> to flash and it 's going to look big because it blooms on the camera i want you to look right here there 's something small there that responds we 're talking to something
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 550.22 556.98 <NA> <unk> looks like a little of string pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls and
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 557.54 566.73 <NA> this was very consistent this was in the bahamas at about two thousand feet we basically have a chat room going on here because once it gets started everybody <unk>
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 566.63 576.57 <NA> <unk> 's talking <unk> and i think this is actually a shrimp that 's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water but the cool thing is we 're talking to it we don 't know what we 're saying <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 581.25 583.91 <NA> and then finally i want to show you
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 583.7 593.54 <NA> some responses that we recorded with the world 's first deep sea webcam which we had installed in monterey canyon last year we 've only just begun to analyze all of this data <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 593.54 604.94 <NA> this is going to be a glowing source first which is like bioluminescent bacteria <unk> and it is an optical cue that there 's carrion on the bottom of the ocean <unk> so this scavenger
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 604.9 606.17 <NA> <unk> comes in 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 605.74 620.73 <NA> which is a giant sixgill shark <unk> and i can 't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in because there 's bait right there but if it had been following the odor plume it would have come in from the other direction <unk> and it does actually seem to be trying to eat
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 620.51 621.53 <NA> the
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 621.07 622.83 <NA> electronic jellyfish that 's a
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 630.04 635.85 <NA> it 's going to be this pinwheel display <unk> and this is a burglar alarm <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 635.36 645.81 <NA> and that was a humboldt squid a juvenile humboldt squid about three feet long this is at three thousand feet in monterey canyon <unk> but if it 's a burglar alarm you wouldn 't expect it to attack <unk>
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 645.71 654.4 <NA> <unk> the jellyfish directly it 's supposed to be attacking what 's attacking the jellyfish <unk> but we did see a bunch of responses like this this guy is a little more contemplative
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 654.9 656.38 <NA> <unk> hey <unk> wait a minute 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 656.61 662.08 <NA> there 's supposed to be something else there he 's thinking about it 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 662.22 666.1 <NA> but he 's persistent he keeps coming back <unk> 
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 666.24 673.55 <NA> and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if i come in
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 673.36 674.81 <NA> from a different angle
EdithWidder_2011 1 EdithWidder_2011 682.33 692.69 <NA> <unk> we are starting to get a handle on this but only just the beginnings we need more eyes on the process so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible by all means climb <unk>
