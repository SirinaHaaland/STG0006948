CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 829.99 837.56 <NA> <unk> on my behalf another reason although i think perhaps the most powerful reason why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo
CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 837.07 848 <NA> that we 've erected against slowing down slow is a dirty word in our culture it 's a byword for lazy slacker for being somebody who gives up you know he 's a bit slow it 's actually

CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 869.54 875.02 <NA> <unk> but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is that there is such a thing as

CarlHonore_2005G 1 CarlHonore_2005G 902.17 911.78 <NA> and i knew that when when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the new age brigade but it 's also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world you know <unk>
