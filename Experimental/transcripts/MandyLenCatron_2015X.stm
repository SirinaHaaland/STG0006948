MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 12.97 18.89 <NA> <unk> i published this article <unk> in the new york times modern love column in january of this year to
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 18.4 21.23 <NA> fall in love with anyone do this 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 20.74 29.91 <NA> and the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory <unk> and my own experience trying the study myself one
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 30.05 31.53 <NA> <unk> last summer <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 31.1 41.25 <NA> so the procedure is fairly simple two strangers take turns asking each other thirty six increasingly personal questions
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 40.76 50.23 <NA> and then they stare into each other 's eyes without speaking for four minutes so here are a couple of sample questions
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 50.7 58.69 <NA> <unk> number twelve if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability what would it be <unk> number <unk>
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 59.75 68.23 <NA> when did you last cry in front of another person by yourself as you can see they really do get more personal as they go along <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 67.95 74.81 <NA> number thirty i really like this one tell your partner what you like about them be very honest this
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 75.58 80.66 <NA> <unk> saying things you might not say to someone you just met <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 80.35 85.22 <NA> so when i first came across this study a few years earlier 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 85.22 96.92 <NA> one detail really stuck out to me and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later <unk> and they 'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 96.79 100.2 <NA> so i was of course very skeptical
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 100.19 106.71 <NA> <unk> about this process of just manufacturing romantic love <unk> but of course i was intrigued <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 106.25 113.18 <NA> and when i got the chance to try this study myself with someone i knew but not particularly well <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 113.19 116.52 <NA> i wasn 't expecting to fall in love <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 116.03 119.34 <NA> but then we did and 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 120.11 124.99 <NA> laughter and i thought it made a good story <unk> so i sent it to the modern
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 125 131.71 <NA> <unk> love column a few months later now this was published in january <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 131.37 139.48 <NA> and now it is august <unk> so i 'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering are we still together <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 139.17 144.74 <NA> and the reason i think you might be wondering this is because i have been asked this question
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 144.58 153.65 <NA> again and again and again for the past seven months and this question is really what i want to talk about today but let 's come back to it
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 156.46 161.45 <NA> so the week before the article came out i was very nervous <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 161.25 165.83 <NA> i had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 165.83 171.62 <NA> so i had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 171.43 179.94 <NA> but a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most and those were usually just my facebook friends <unk> and i
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 179.87 185.82 <NA> <unk> figured my article in the new york times would probably get a few thousand views <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 185.6 192.06 <NA> and that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 191.57 196.08 <NA> but as it turned out i had no idea <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 195.74 204.97 <NA> so the article was published online on a friday evening <unk> and by saturday this had happened to the traffic on my blog

MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 224.35 229.94 <NA> to work up the confidence to write honestly about your experiences with love <unk> but it is another thing
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 230.07 236.68 <NA> to discover that your love life has made international news and to realize

MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 296.09 304.76 <NA> i just wasn 't prepared for the scope of the response the thirty six questions seem to have taken on a life of their own in fact

MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 366.66 371.2 <NA> but this was a question i didn 't feel capable of answering 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 370.74 378.59 <NA> my own relationship was only a few months old <unk> and i felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place

MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 454.63 457.37 <NA> <unk> unfortunately it was never published 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 458.14 463.82 <NA> so a few months ago <unk> i was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 463.82 469.16 <NA> and a student came up to me afterwards and he said kind of shyly 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 468.85 474.17 <NA> so i tried your study <unk> and it didn 't work 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 473.89 479.97 <NA> he seemed a little mystified by this you mean you didn 't fall in love with the person you did

MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 492.74 499.96 <NA> did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study he nodded so then it worked 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 501.51 504.64 <NA> <unk> think this is the answer he was looking for 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 504.93 511.82 <NA> in fact <unk> i don 't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 511.82 518.68 <NA> i first came across this study when i was twenty nine and i was going through a really difficult breakup <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 518.19 524.14 <NA> i had been in the relationship since i was twenty <unk> which was basically my entire adult life 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 523.71 529.85 <NA> and he was my first real love and i had no idea how or if i could make a life

MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 533.41 538.26 <NA> i researched everything i could find about the science of romantic love <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 538.26 543.35 <NA> and i think i was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 543.07 546.68 <NA> i don 't know if i realized this at the time
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 546.64 554.97 <NA> i thought i was just doing research for this book i was writing but it seems really obvious in retrospect <unk> i hoped that if i
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 554.96 563.73 <NA> <unk> armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love <unk> i might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as i did then 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 563.84 568.56 <NA> and all this knowledge has been useful in some ways i
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 568.16 575.31 <NA> am more patient with love i am more relaxed i am more confident about asking for what i want <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 575.06 579.97 <NA> but i can also see myself more clearly <unk> and i can see
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 579.75 586.21 <NA> <unk> see that what i want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 586.2 589.66 <NA> what i want from love is a guarantee 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 589.65 597.38 <NA> not just that i am loved today and that i will be loved tomorrow <unk> but that i will continue to be loved
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 597.22 599.12 <NA> by the person i love
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 598.9 604.91 <NA> indefinitely <unk> maybe it 's this possibility of a guarantee that
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 604.87 610.13 <NA> <unk> people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 610.27 617.94 <NA> so the story that the media told about the thirty six questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 617.94 629.43 <NA> there might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved <unk> and this is a very appealing story because falling in love feels amazing <unk> but it 's also terrifying
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 630.38 636.54 <NA> <unk> the moment you admit to loving someone you admit to having a lot to lose <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 636.14 643.02 <NA> and it 's true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 643.02 647.71 <NA> which is also a mechanism for being known <unk> and i think this is the thing
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 647.54 654.22 <NA> that most of us really want from love to be known to be seen to be understood
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 655.14 661.6 <NA> <unk> but i think when it comes to love <unk> we are too willing to accept the short version of the story 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 661.17 668.95 <NA> the version of the story that asks are you still together and is content with a yes or no answer 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 669.09 676.84 <NA> so rather than that question i would propose we ask some more difficult questions questions like 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 676.56 679.94 <NA> how do you decide who deserves your love
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 679.98 681.59 <NA> and who does not 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 682.36 688.94 <NA> how do you stay in love when things get difficult <unk> and how do you know when to just cut and run 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 689.44 699.14 <NA> how do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship or even harder how do you live with your partner 's doubt 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 700.28 708.44 <NA> <unk> necessarily know the answers to these questions <unk> but i think they 're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 708.28 711.06 <NA> about what it means to love someone 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 711.56 713.97 <NA> so if you want it 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 713.96 721.87 <NA> the short version of the story of my relationship is this a year ago <unk> an acquaintance and i did a study
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 721.71 729.61 <NA> designed to create romantic love and we fell in love <unk> and we are still together <unk> and i am so glad
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 730.56 736.12 <NA> but falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 735.93 739.66 <NA> falling in love is the easy part <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 739.89 748.09 <NA> so at the end of my article i wrote love didn 't happen to us we 're in love because we each made the choice to be 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 747.6 752.17 <NA> and i cringe a little when i read that now 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 751.83 754.94 <NA> not because it isn 't true but
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 754.96 761.42 <NA> <unk> because at the time i really hadn 't considered everything that was contained in that choice 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 761.02 766.52 <NA> i didn 't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice <unk> 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 766.27 770.28 <NA> and how many times i will continue to have to make that choice
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 770.1 777.57 <NA> without knowing whether or not he will always choose me i want it to be enough to have asked and answered
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 779.9 784.72 <NA> <unk> to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 784.51 787.2 <NA> and to have broadcast that choice

MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 790.43 797.88 <NA> but what i have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth i don 't quite believe in 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 797.72 804.16 <NA> and what i want what perhaps i will spend my life wanting is for that myth to be true
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 805.11 815.41 <NA> <unk> i want the happy ending implied by the title to my article <unk> which is incidentally <unk> the only part of the article that i didn 't actually write 
MandyLenCatron_2015X 1 MandyLenCatron_2015X 818.01 823.01 <NA> but what i have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone <unk>
