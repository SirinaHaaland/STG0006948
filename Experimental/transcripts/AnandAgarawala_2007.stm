AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 15.55 24.12 <NA> <unk> era of computer interfaces like they 're very kind of they don 't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and i 'd like to change all that <unk> hit me <unk>
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 26.84 35.88 <NA> <unk> so i mean this is the kind of status quo interface right it 's very flat kind of rigid and ok so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable mac <unk> you know
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 35.51 40.29 <NA> <unk> but really it 's the kind of same old crap we 've had for the last <unk> you know thirty years 
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 44.66 49.96 <NA> like i think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers i mean it 's point and click it 's like the menus icons
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 50.64 58.36 <NA> <unk> it 's all the kind of same thing and so one kind of information space that i take inspiration from is my real desk <unk> it 's so much more subtle so much more <unk>
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 60.39 66.28 <NA> <unk> visceral <unk> and i 'd like to bring that experience to the desktop so i kind of have a
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 66.48 71.32 <NA> this is this is bumptop it 's kind of like a new approach to
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 70.83 76.73 <NA> desktop computing so you can bump things they 're all physically <unk> you know manipulable and stuff
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 79.96 88.8 <NA> <unk> point and click it 's like a push and pull things collide as you 'd expect them just like on my real desk <unk> i can let me just grab these guys i can turn things into piles
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 88.8 91.52 <NA> instead of just the folders that we have 
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 94.87 101.42 <NA> and once things are in a pile i can browse them by throwing them into a grid or you know flip through them like a book
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 102.4 104.94 <NA> or i can lay them out like a deck of cards
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 106.46 111.96 <NA> when they 're laid out i can pull things to new locations or delete things
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 111.53 115.86 <NA> or just quickly sort a whole pile you know just immediately right
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 115.97 124.99 <NA> <unk> and then <unk> it 's all smoothly animated instead of these jarring changes you see in today 's interfaces <unk> also if i want to add something to a pile well how do i do that i just toss it
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 126.42 129.64 <NA> <unk> 's added right to the top it 's a kind of nice way 
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 129.57 140.05 <NA> also some of the stuff we can do is for these individual icons we thought i mean how can we play with the idea of an icon and push that further and one of the things i can do is make it bigger <unk>
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 140 148.9 <NA> if i want to emphasize it and make it more important <unk> but what 's really cool is that since there 's a physics simulation running under this it 's actually heavier so the lighter stuff
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 160.27 164.66 <NA> <unk> also like a subtle channel of conveying information right this is heavy so it feels more important <unk> 
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 164.29 173.76 <NA> so it 's kind of cool <unk> despite computers everywhere paper really hasn 't disappeared because it has a lot of i think valuable properties and some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 173.76 177.45 <NA> so one of the things you can do to our icons just like paper is crease them
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 177.27 178.79 <NA> and fold them
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 178.36 179.94 <NA> just like paper remember
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 179.93 184.99 <NA> <unk> you know <unk> something for later or if you want to be destructive you can just crumple it up
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 184.99 194.95 <NA> and you know toss it to the corner <unk> also just like paper around our workspace we 'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later <unk> and i can do the same thing
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 194.72 199.93 <NA> here <unk> and you know you 'll see <unk> post it notes and things like that around people 's offices and i can pull them off when i
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 202.38 209.68 <NA> <unk> the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that you know okay well my real desk is really messy i don 't want that mess on my
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 209.34 213.7 <NA> computer so one thing we have for that is like a grid align kind of
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 213.48 218.17 <NA> so you get that more traditional desktop things are kind of grid aligned more boring but
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 217.68 223.63 <NA> you still have that kind of colliding and bumping and you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop let
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 226.81 228.68 <NA> <unk> just break this shelf okay
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 228.58 237.87 <NA> that shelf broke <unk> i think beyond the icons i think another really cool domain for this software i think it applies to more than just icons
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 237.71 239.16 <NA> and your desktop
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 238.71 242 <NA> but browsing photographs i think you can really enrich
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 241.99 250.05 <NA> the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of you know <unk> photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing i can toss these things around they 're so
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 250 257.85 <NA> so much more tangible and and touchable and you know i can double click on something to take a look at it and i can do all that kind of same stuff i showed you before so i can pile things up 
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 257.85 260.41 <NA> i can flip through it i can you know
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 260.25 266.23 <NA> okay let 's move this this photo to the back let 's delete this guy here <unk> and
AnandAgarawala_2007 1 AnandAgarawala_2007 266.05 268.24 <NA> i think it 's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting
