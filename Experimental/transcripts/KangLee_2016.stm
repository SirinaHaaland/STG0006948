KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 14.41 21.89 <NA> <unk> let me ask the audience a question did you ever lie as a child <unk> if you did could you please raise your hand <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 22.69 27.02 <NA> wow this is the most honest group of people i 've ever met 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 28 29.94 <NA> laughter so for the last twenty years
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 30.22 38.52 <NA> i 've been studying how children learn to tell lies <unk> and today <unk> i 'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 38.15 46.95 <NA> but to begin i 'm going to tell you a story from mr richard messina who is my friend and an elementary school principal 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 46.73 49.02 <NA> he got a phone call one day 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 53.64 57.88 <NA> <unk> my son johnny will not come to school today because he 's sick mr 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 57.99 62.5 <NA> messina asks who am i speaking to please 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 62.28 66.16 <NA> and the caller says i am my father 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 69.69 70.93 <NA> so
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 70.53 79.49 <NA> this story sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 80.11 83.76 <NA> <unk> one children only come to
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 83.52 87.29 <NA> tell lies after entering elementary school 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 87.01 96.83 <NA> two children are poor liars we adults can easily detect their lies <unk> and three if children lie at a very young age <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 96.37 103.56 <NA> there must be some character flaws with them and they are going to become pathological liars for life
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 104.69 109.5 <NA> <unk> well it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 110.09 116.79 <NA> we have been playing guessing games with children all over the world here is an example <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 116.78 121.8 <NA> so in this game <unk> we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 121.49 129.94 <NA> and we tell them if they win the game they are going to get a big prize but in the middle of the game <unk> we make an excuse
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 130.31 131.68 <NA> and leave the room 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 133.29 139.03 <NA> and before we leave the room we tell them not to peek at the cards 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 139.05 143.09 <NA> of course <unk> we have hidden cameras in the room
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 142.61 145.18 <NA> to watch their every move <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 145.68 153.14 <NA> because the desire to win the game is so strong more than ninety percent <unk> of children will peek
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 152.95 154.34 <NA> as soon as we leave the room
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 156.55 161.66 <NA> the crucial question is when we return and ask the children
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 161.66 165.87 <NA> whether or not they have peeked will the children who peeked
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 165.69 169.91 <NA> confess or lie about their transgression <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 171.01 175.35 <NA> we found that that regardless of gender country
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 176.9 180.69 <NA> <unk> at two years of age <unk> thirty percent lie <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 180.65 188.62 <NA> seventy percent tell the truth about their transgression <unk> at three years of age <unk> fifty percent lie
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 188.29 195.39 <NA> and fifty percent tell the truth at four years of age <unk> more than eighty percent lie
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 195.74 204.85 <NA> <unk> and after four years of age <unk> most children lie <unk> so as you can see lying is really a typical part of
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 204.78 211.78 <NA> <unk> development <unk> and some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 211.98 215.98 <NA> so now let 's take a closer look at the younger children 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 216.84 218.68 <NA> why do
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 218.25 226.88 <NA> some but not all young children lie in cooking you need good ingredients to cook good food
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 230.1 232.76 <NA> two key ingredients 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 232.6 239.42 <NA> the first key ingredient is theory of mind or the mind reading ability 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 239.26 246.48 <NA> mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 246.3 250.2 <NA> and the ability to differentiate between what i know
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 250.28 251.76 <NA> <unk> and what you know <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 251.42 260.11 <NA> mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that i know you don 't know what i know <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 260.11 261.99 <NA> therefore i can lie to you 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 262.58 267.48 <NA> the second key ingredient for good lying is self control 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 267.47 276.21 <NA> it is the ability to control your speech your facial expression and your body language so that you can tell a convincing lie 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 276.47 278.4 <NA> and we found
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 278.03 279.97 <NA> that those young children
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 280.22 282.35 <NA> who have more advanced <unk>
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 283.4 287.42 <NA> and self control abilities tell lies earlier
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 287.18 290.71 <NA> and are more sophisticated liars 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 291.39 299.72 <NA> as it turns out these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 316.39 325.05 <NA> <unk> is telling his or her first lie <unk> instead of being alarmed you should celebrate because
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 327.17 328.3 <NA> <unk> has arrived
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 328.12 331.95 <NA> at a new milestone of typical development <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 332.6 340.17 <NA> now are children poor liars <unk> do you think you can easily detect their lies <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 340.25 349.9 <NA> would you like to give it a try yes <unk> ok <unk> so i 'm going to show you two videos <unk> in the videos <unk> the children are going to respond to a
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 352.74 357.59 <NA> <unk> so try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 380.38 384.08 <NA> <unk> if you think child number two is lying <unk> please raise your hand <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 385.12 393.47 <NA> ok so as a matter of fact <unk> child number one is telling the truth <unk> child number two is lying <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 393.64 397.88 <NA> looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children 's lies 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 400.55 406.05 <NA> <unk> we have played similar kinds of games with many many adults
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 405.74 408.33 <NA> from all walks of life <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 408.23 411.3 <NA> and we show them many videos <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 410.84 417.21 <NA> in half of the videos <unk> the children lied in the other half of the videos the children told the truth <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 418.07 425.05 <NA> and let 's find out how these adults performed because there are as many liars as
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 426.48 428.38 <NA> <unk> if you guess randomly <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 428.13 432.64 <NA> there 's a fifty percent chance you 're going to get it right <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 432.24 440.11 <NA> so if your accuracy is around fifty percent it means you are a terrible detector of children 's lies
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 439.77 442.09 <NA> so let 's start with
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 442.05 448.63 <NA> undergrads and law school students who typically have limited experience with children no
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 450.22 457.58 <NA> <unk> they cannot detect children 's lies <unk> their performance is around chance now how about social workers and <unk>
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 458.74 464.42 <NA> <unk> lawyers <unk> who work with children on a daily basis can they detect children 's lies <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 465.13 471.17 <NA> no they cannot what about judges <unk> customs officers
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 470.71 474.99 <NA> and police officers who deal with liars on a daily
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 475.7 477.87 <NA> <unk> can they detect children 's lies <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 478.31 485.01 <NA> no they cannot <unk> what about parents can parents detect other children 's lies <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 485.45 491.76 <NA> no they cannot <unk> what about can parents detect their own children 's lies <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 492.74 494.7 <NA> no they cannot 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 497.42 504.1 <NA> so now you may ask why children 's lies are so difficult to detect
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 504.95 511.69 <NA> let me illustrate this with my own son nathan this is his facial expression when he lies 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 512.73 518.89 <NA> laughter so when children lie their facial expression is typically neutral <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 518.64 524.99 <NA> however <unk> behind this neutral expression the child is actually experiencing a lot of
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 529.78 533.15 <NA> <unk> and maybe a little bit of liar 's delight 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 535.12 539.25 <NA> laughter unfortunately <unk> such emotions are either fleeting
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 539.04 548.93 <NA> or hidden therefore it 's mostly invisible to us <unk> so in the last five years <unk> we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 548.47 550.23 <NA> then we made a discovery
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 551.21 557.7 <NA> <unk> we know that underneath our facial skin <unk> there 's a rich network of blood vessels 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 557.7 563.28 <NA> when we experience different emotions our facial blood flow changes subtly <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 563.12 569.88 <NA> and these changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 569.63 574.9 <NA> by looking at facial blood flow changes <unk> we can reveal
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 580.2 584.98 <NA> <unk> facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 585.15 595.96 <NA> so to help us reveal people 's facial emotions <unk> we have developed a new imaging technology we call transdermal optical imaging 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 596.19 604.97 <NA> to do so we use a regular video camera to record people when they experience various hidden emotions <unk> and then
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 605.31 614.45 <NA> using our image processing technology we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 616 622.76 <NA> by looking at transdermal video images now we can easily see
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 623.23 629.04 <NA> facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 629.9 644.22 <NA> <unk> and using this technology we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying and therefore detect people 's lies <unk> we can do so noninvasively <unk> remotely <unk> inexpensively 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 644.22 650.37 <NA> with an accuracy at about eighty five percent which is far better than chance level <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 650.57 654.55 <NA> and in addition <unk> we discovered a pinocchio effect
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 655.86 658.63 <NA> not this pinocchio effect 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 658.5 661.3 <NA> laughter this is the real pinocchio effect <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 661.07 662.8 <NA> when people lie <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 662.8 670.48 <NA> the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases <unk> and the facial blood flow on the nose increases 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 670.89 679.91 <NA> of course lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions <unk> so then we asked ourselves in
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 679.84 687.36 <NA> <unk> addition to detecting lies <unk> how can our technology be used one application is in
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 687.12 697.49 <NA> education <unk> for example <unk> using this technology we can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 697.49 699.29 <NA> high anxiety
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 698.98 704.97 <NA> about the topic he 's teaching so that he can help him <unk> and also we can use this in
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 704.96 711.96 <NA> <unk> health care for example <unk> every day i skype my parents <unk> who live thousands of miles away <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 711.71 713.86 <NA> and using this technology 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 713.86 722.28 <NA> i can not only find out what 's going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 721.91 727.35 <NA> their stress level their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 727.34 729.43 <NA> and perhaps in the future
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 729.93 733.3 <NA> <unk> risks for heart attack or hypertension <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 733.26 741.25 <NA> and you may ask can we use this also to reveal politicians ' emotions laughter
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 741.96 744.58 <NA> for example during a debate well
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 744.72 752.96 <NA> the answer is yes <unk> using tv footage we could detect the politicians ' heart rate <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 752.96 754.97 <NA> mood and stress
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 755.19 759.29 <NA> and perhaps in the future whether or not they are lying to us <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 758.98 769.13 <NA> we can also use this in marketing research for example to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 768.73 775.05 <NA> we can even use it in dating <unk> so for example <unk> if your date is smiling at you
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 775.79 780.91 <NA> <unk> this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 780.7 783.63 <NA> or she is just trying to be nice to you 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 783.41 787.89 <NA> and in this case she is just trying to be nice to you 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 790.67 797.47 <NA> so transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 797.47 802.14 <NA> many new applications will come about that we don 't know today <unk> 
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 801.83 804.79 <NA> however <unk> one thing i know for sure
KangLee_2016 1 KangLee_2016 805.05 809.39 <NA> <unk> is that lying will never be the same again thank you very much
