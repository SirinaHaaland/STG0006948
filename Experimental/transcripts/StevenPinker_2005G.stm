StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 142.31 146.89 <NA> my passion for verbs and how they 're used the problem is 
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 146.55 154.94 <NA> which verbs go in which constructions <unk> the verb is the chassis of the sentence it 's the framework onto which the other parts are
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 154.87 155.96 <NA> <unk> bolted let me
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 156.19 162.75 <NA> give you a a quick reminder of something that you 've long forgotten an intransitive verb such as dine 
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 162.75 170.13 <NA> for example can 't take a direct object you have to say sam dined not sam dined the pizza a transitive verb
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 169.89 174.75 <NA> mandates that there has to be an object there sam devoured the pizza you can 't just say sam
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 176.69 185.97 <NA> <unk> dozens or scores of verbs of this type each of which shapes its sentence so a problem in explaining how children learn language a problem in
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 185.77 195.78 <NA> teaching language to adults so that they don 't make grammatical errors and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions <unk> 
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 195.5 199.81 <NA> for example <unk> the dative construction in english you can say give a muffin to a

StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 210.13 217.13 <NA> so a tempting generalization for a child for an adult for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction

StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 222.29 225.02 <NA> handy thing to have because language

StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 251.3 261.9 <NA> <unk> the solution is that these constructions despite initial appearance are not synonymous that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition you see that there 's a subtle difference in meaning between them 
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 261.67 264.21 <NA> so give the x to the y 
StevenPinker_2005G 1 StevenPinker_2005G 264.21 275.76 <NA> that construction corresponds to the thought cause x to go to y whereas give the y the x corresponds to the thought cause y to have x now <unk> many events
