JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 62.91 65.8 <NA> this information is also pretty staggering 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 65.43 72.83 <NA> you might know that so far in just the dawn of this revolution we know that there are perhaps forty thousand unique mutations

JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 126.56 129.64 <NA> and the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 130.05 138.49 <NA> <unk> too hard that for whatever reason these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that 's called the undruggable genome
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 138.15 144.17 <NA> which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the moon unwalkable it 's a horrible term of trade <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 144.17 153.56 <NA> but what it means is that we 've failed to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins into which we like molecular locksmiths can fashion an active small
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 154.93 156.5 <NA> <unk> or drug substance 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 156.28 164.48 <NA> now as i was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation what we had instead <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 164.11 170.78 <NA> cascading through the regulatory network at the fda were these substances arsenic

JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 206.19 215.41 <NA> and so <unk> please consider this a work in progress but i 'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 215.37 225.23 <NA> about the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer called brd4 and about a molecule developed at my lab at dana farber cancer institute
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 226.42 230.93 <NA> <unk> which we affectionately named for jun qi the chemist that made this molecule <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 231.22 239.19 <NA> now brd4 is an interesting protein you might ask with all the things cancer 's trying to do to kill our patient how does it remember it 's cancer <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 239.19 243.6 <NA> when it winds up its genome <unk> divides into two cells and unwinds again <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 243.36 250.1 <NA> why does it not turn into an eye into a liver as it has all the genes necessary to do this it remembers that it 's cancer 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 250.21 254.97 <NA> and the reason is that cancer <unk> like every cell in the body places little molecular
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 255.05 260.28 <NA> <unk> bookmarks little post it notes that remind the cell i 'm cancer <unk> i should keep growing 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 260.27 266.43 <NA> and those post it notes involve this and other proteins of its class so called bromodomains 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 266.27 277.27 <NA> so we developed an idea a rationale that perhaps if we made a molecule that prevented the post it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 277.27 279.97 <NA> then maybe we could convince cancer cells certainly
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 279.96 283.9 <NA> <unk> those addicted to this brd4 protein that they 're not cancer <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 283.86 293.11 <NA> and so we started to work on this problem we developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called <unk> jq1 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 293.1 298.55 <NA> now not being a drug company we could do certain things we had certain flexibilities that
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 298.31 304.88 <NA> i respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn 't have we just started mailing it to our friends <unk> i have a small lab
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 305.02 315.29 <NA> <unk> we thought we 'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves we sent it to oxford england where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture which helped us understand exactly how this molecule <unk>
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 315.19 321.86 <NA> <unk> is so potent for this protein target it 's what we call a perfect fit of shape complementarity or hand in glove now 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 326.12 336.63 <NA> <unk> and so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at brigham and women 's hospital and as we treated these cells with this molecule <unk> we observed something really striking 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 336.23 339.99 <NA> the cancer cells small round and rapidly dividing 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 339.62 344.13 <NA> grew these arms and extensions they were changing shape 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 343.82 347.23 <NA> in effect <unk> the cancer cell
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 346.99 353.23 <NA> was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell this got us very excited
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 354.93 360.64 <NA> <unk> next step would be to put this molecule into mice the only problem was there 's no mouse model of this rare cancer <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 360.39 367.06 <NA> and so at the time we were doing this research i was caring for a 29 year old firefighter from connecticut
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 366.69 369.16 <NA> who was very much at the end of life
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 368.76 371.35 <NA> with this incurable cancer 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 371.13 379.76 <NA> this brd4 addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung <unk> and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris and every nursing shift we would throw this
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 379.69 382.83 <NA> <unk> material out <unk> and so we approached this patient
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 382.83 391.05 <NA> and asked if he would collaborate with us could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 390.81 399.93 <NA> and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial at a stage that with a prototype drug well that would be of course impossible and rightly illegal to do in
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 400.55 401.97 <NA> <unk> and he obliged us 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 402.5 406.54 <NA> at the lurie family center for animal imaging our colleague andrew kung <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 406.3 413.8 <NA> grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic <unk> and you can see this pet scan of a mouse what we call a pet pet 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 413.8 418.8 <NA> the cancer is growing as this red huge mass in the hind limb of this animal 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 418.43 421.08 <NA> and as we treat it with our compound 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 420.68 428.67 <NA> this addiction to sugar this rapid growth faded and on the animal on the right you see that the cancer was responding 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 429.75 441.13 <NA> <unk> completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease and every time we see the same thing the mice with this cancer that get the drug live <unk> and the ones that don 't rapidly perish 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 442.26 452.83 <NA> so we started to wonder what would a drug company do at this point well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn the prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance <unk>
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 452.58 454.34 <NA> so we did just the opposite
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 455.02 456.07 <NA> <unk> published a paper
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 455.82 460.07 <NA> that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage <unk> 
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 460 467.69 <NA> we gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule <unk> typically a secret in our discipline we told people exactly how to make it

JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 480.5 489.57 <NA> because now <unk> we 've shared this molecule just since december of last year with forty laboratories in the united states and thirty more in europe
JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 489.34 496.65 <NA> many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space to target this rare cancer that <unk> thankfully right now

JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 554.93 563.91 <NA> <unk> that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery that our center which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other

JayBradner_2011X 1 JayBradner_2011X 566.03 573.66 <NA> for all the reasons you see listed here we think there 's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest
