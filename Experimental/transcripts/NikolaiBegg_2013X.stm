NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 12.94 19.04 <NA> <unk> the first time i stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery <unk> i had no idea what to expect 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 18.82 25.23 <NA> i was a college student in engineering <unk> i thought it was going to be like on tv <unk> ominous music playing in the background
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 25.31 34.23 <NA> <unk> beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon 's face <unk> but it wasn 't like that at all there was music playing on this day i think it was madonna 's greatest hits 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 34.31 41.58 <NA> and there was plenty of conversation not just about the patient 's heart rate but about sports and weekend plans <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 41.21 48 <NA> and since then <unk> the more surgeries i watched the more i realized this is how it is in some weird way it 's just another day at the office <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 48.02 50.22 <NA> but every so often
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 50.03 54.97 <NA> the music gets turned down everyone stops talking and stares at exactly the
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 54.93 60.88 <NA> <unk> same thing <unk> and that 's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 60.81 65.78 <NA> the first time i saw that i was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 65.45 68.14 <NA> and for those of you who are unfamiliar 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 67.86 73.06 <NA> laparoscopic surgery instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 73.06 79.97 <NA> a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates these three or more small incisions in the patient <unk> and then inserts these long
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 79.72 85.79 <NA> <unk> long thin instruments and a camera <unk> and actually does the procedure inside the patient 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 85.9 91.37 <NA> this is great because there 's much less risk of infection much less pain shorter recovery time 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 91.57 93.68 <NA> but there is a trade off 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 94.3 96.96 <NA> because these incisions are created
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 96.79 100.05 <NA> with a long <unk> pointed device called a trocar
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 100.31 107.61 <NA> <unk> and the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 109.25 115.06 <NA> and now the reason why everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 115.06 121.98 <NA> was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs and blood vessels below <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 123.08 128.14 <NA> but this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you because i 'm pretty sure you 've seen it somewhere else
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 135.39 138.43 <NA> you knew that at any second that straw <unk>
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 138.33 145.69 <NA> <unk> was going to plunge through and you didn 't know if it was going to go out the other side and straight into your hand or if you were going to get juice everywhere <unk> but you were terrified 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 155.17 157.55 <NA> <unk> and it turns out it really is a problem 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 157.27 165.6 <NA> in two thousand and three the fda actually came out and said that trocar incisions might be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 165.6 175.05 <NA> again in two thousand and nine we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery and oh by the way
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 175.31 177.96 <NA> <unk> this hasn 't changed for twenty five years <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 178.64 182.49 <NA> so when i got to graduate school this is what i wanted to work on
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 182.12 187.5 <NA> <unk> i was trying to explain to a friend of mine what exactly i was spending my time doing and i said 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 187.64 190.17 <NA> it 's like when you 're drilling through a wall
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 189.74 198.45 <NA> to hang something in your apartment there 's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall and there 's this
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 198.41 204.55 <NA> plunge right <unk> and he looked at me and he said
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 205.56 210.7 <NA> you mean like when they drill into people 's brains and i said excuse me 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 210.72 219.91 <NA> and then i looked it up and they do drill into people 's brains a lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 219.6 224.41 <NA> and if the surgeon isn 't careful he can plunge directly into the brain 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 224.97 229.4 <NA> so this is the moment when i started thinking okay cranial drilling
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 229.72 236.42 <NA> <unk> laparoscopic surgery <unk> why not other areas of medicine because think about it when was the last time you went to the doctor and you didn 't get stuck with something 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 236.29 244.34 <NA> right so the truth is in medicine puncture is everywhere <unk> and here are just a couple of the procedures that i 've found
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 243.85 249.08 <NA> that involve some tissue puncture step and if we take just three of them
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 248.77 249.99 <NA> laparoscopic
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 251.75 253.26 <NA> <unk> and cranial drilling
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 252.86 261.81 <NA> these procedures account for over thirty thousand complications every year in this country alone <unk> i call that a problem worth solving <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 262.37 265.33 <NA> so let 's take a look at some of the devices
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 264.91 267.63 <NA> that are used in these types of procedures 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 267.35 275.14 <NA> i mentioned epidurals this is an epidural needle it 's used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 275.64 283.36 <NA> <unk> here 's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools these are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 283.2 285.64 <NA> here 's a bayonette from the civil war 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 288.12 293.14 <NA> if i had told you it was a medical puncture device you probably would have believed me
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 293.22 299.93 <NA> <unk> because what 's the difference <unk> so the more i did this research the more i thought there has to be a better way to do
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 300.91 301.97 <NA> <unk> and for me
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 301.77 309.26 <NA> the key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 309.37 312.74 <NA> so what are those physics let 's go back to drilling through a wall <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 312.46 321 <NA> so you 're applying a force on a drill towards the wall and newton says the wall is going to apply force back <unk> equal and opposite 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 321 324.83 <NA> so as you drill through the wall those forces balance <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 324.46 329.97 <NA> but then there 's that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall and right at that moment the wall
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 329.96 334.74 <NA> <unk> can 't push back anymore <unk> but your brain hasn 't reacted to that change in force 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 334.55 343.44 <NA> so for that millisecond or however long it takes you to react you 're still pushing <unk> and that unbalanced force causes an acceleration <unk> and that is the plunge <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 344.03 345.73 <NA> but what if
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 345.54 348.42 <NA> what if right at the moment of puncture
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 347.93 354.1 <NA> you could pull that tip back actually oppose the forward acceleration that 's what i set out to do
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 355.05 362.71 <NA> <unk> so imagine you have a device and it 's got some kind of sharp tip to cut through tissue what 's the simplest way you could pull that tip back <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 362.52 364.27 <NA> i chose a spring <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 364.05 368.79 <NA> so when you extend that spring you extend that tip out so it 's ready to puncture tissue 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 368.79 374.5 <NA> the spring wants to pull the tip back <unk> how do you keep the tip in place until the moment of puncture 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 374.67 379.91 <NA> i used this mechanism when the tip of the device is pressed against tissue
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 379.92 383.75 <NA> the mechanism expands outwards and wedges in place against the wall 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 383.55 392.65 <NA> and the friction that 's generated locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip but right at the moment of puncture the tissue can 't push back on the tip anymore <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 392.65 396 <NA> so the mechanism unlocks and the spring retracts the tip let
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 395.76 401.3 <NA> me show you that happening in slow motion this is about two thousand frames a second and i 'd like you to notice the tip
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 400.99 403.92 <NA> that 's right there on the bottom about to puncture through tissue
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 404.78 407.19 <NA> <unk> right at the moment of puncture 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 407.54 411.9 <NA> right there the mechanism unlocks and retracts that tip back i
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 411.53 420.07 <NA> want to show it to you again a little closer up you 're going to see the sharp bladed tip <unk> and right when it punctures that rubber membrane it 's going to disappear into this
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 419.9 424.96 <NA> white blunt sheath right there that happens
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 426.6 428.53 <NA> <unk> of a second after puncture 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 428.58 441.61 <NA> and because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery or another procedure it 's applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 442.08 446.44 <NA> but it didn 't always look like this this was my first prototype <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 446.46 454.97 <NA> yes those are popsicle sticks and there 's a rubber band at the top it took about thirty minutes to do this <unk> but it worked and
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 454.93 459.59 <NA> <unk> it proved to me that my idea worked and it justified the next couple years of work on this project <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 459.58 465.11 <NA> i worked on this because this problem really fascinated me it kept me up at night <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 465.07 473.6 <NA> but i think it should fascinate you too because i said puncture is everywhere that means at some point it 's going to be your problem too 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 474.19 479.97 <NA> that first day in the operating room i never expected to find myself on the other end of a trocar but last year
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 479.96 482.49 <NA> <unk> i got appendicitis when i was visiting greece 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 482.66 485.1 <NA> so i was in the hospital in athens 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 484.73 491.61 <NA> and the surgeon was telling me he was going to perform a laparoscopic surgery he was going to remove my appendix through these tiny incisions 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 491.12 497.88 <NA> and he was talking about what i could expect for the recovery and what was going to happen he said do you have any questions and i said just one doc 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 497.48 499.95 <NA> what kind of trocar do you use 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 500.93 504.64 <NA> so my favorite quote about laparoscopic surgery
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 504.75 509.6 <NA> <unk> comes from a doctor h c jacobaeus it is puncture itself
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 509.39 518.62 <NA> that causes risk that 's my favorite quote because h c jacobaeus was the first person to ever perform laparoscopic surgery on humans <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 518.19 521.44 <NA> and he wrote that in one thousand nine hundred and twelve <unk>
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 521.31 526.9 <NA> this is a problem that 's been injuring and even killing people for over one hundred years <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 527.13 529.94 <NA> so it 's easy to think that for every major problem out there
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 530.16 536.57 <NA> 's some team of experts working around the clock to solve it the truth is that 's not always the case <unk> 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 536.56 541.46 <NA> we have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them 
NikolaiBegg_2013X 1 NikolaiBegg_2013X 541.84 551.28 <NA> so if you come across a problem that grabs you let it keep you up at night <unk> allow yourself to be fascinated because there are so many lives to save
