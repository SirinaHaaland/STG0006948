BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 135.18 142.73 <NA> so of course it took time and i was nearly forty <unk> and i decided it 's time to start as an artist
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 155.19 162.74 <NA> <unk> and you can use it in a lot of different ways <unk> and i chose the language of silhouette
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 162.61 171.98 <NA> because graphically it 's very efficient <unk> and it 's also just getting to the essential of things <unk> 
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 172.12 179.64 <NA> so the word silhouette comes from a minister of finance etienne de silhouette
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 180.2 183.42 <NA> <unk> and he slashed so many budgets
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 182.96 190.69 <NA> that people said they couldn 't afford paintings anymore <unk> and they needed to have their portrait
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 205.23 213.91 <NA> and people told me like these thirty six views of the empire state building they told me you 're making artist books

BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 249.42 254.88 <NA> so i 'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 254.81 259.62 <NA> <unk> different languages <unk> so as you can guess my mother tongue is french 
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 259.16 263.14 <NA> and my daily language is english <unk> 
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 263.14 271.81 <NA> so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english <unk>

BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 275.21 279.94 <NA> so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 279.78 286.93 <NA> <unk> bee but it 's much more connected to the web and
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 287.58 293.81 <NA> this spider spins a bilingual alphabet <unk> so you can read
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 305.31 311.99 <NA> and substantives <unk> so if you don 't know one of these languages <unk> it 's instant learning <unk> 
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 313 317.87 <NA> and one ancient form of the book is scrolls 
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 318.01 324.9 <NA> so scrolls are very convenient <unk> because you can create a large image
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 328.67 337.65 <NA> <unk> so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 337.22 341.73 <NA> so it makes a very freestyle architecture <unk> 
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 341.63 345.28 <NA> and i 'm making all those kinds of windows <unk> 
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 345.28 354.97 <NA> so it 's to look beyond the surface it 's to have a look at different worlds and very often i 've been an outsider so
BeatriceCoron_2011 1 BeatriceCoron_2011 354.93 361.77 <NA> <unk> i want to see how things work and what 's happening <unk> so each window
