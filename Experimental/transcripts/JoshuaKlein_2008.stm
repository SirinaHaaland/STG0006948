JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 15.76 25.11 <NA> <unk> any of you get really freaked out by that you might want to leave now so this is a vending machine for crows over the past few days many of you have been asking
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 25.16 33.37 <NA> <unk> how did you come to this how did you get started doing this it started as with many great ideas or many ideas you can 't get rid of anyway at a cocktail party 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 33.19 41.79 <NA> about ten years ago i was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine we were sitting there and he was complaining about the crows that were all over his yard and making a big mess <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 41.62 46.4 <NA> and he was telling me we ought to eradicate these things kill them because they 're making a mess 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 46.4 51.78 <NA> i said that was stupid maybe we should just train them to do something useful and he said that was impossible <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 51.35 54.97 <NA> and i 'm sure i 'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 55.04 60.16 <NA> when someone tells you it 's impossible <unk> so i spent the next ten years reading about crows in my spare time 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 62.91 69.88 <NA> and after ten years of this my wife said you 've got to do this thing you 've been talking about and build the vending machine so i did <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 69.69 72.88 <NA> but part of the reason i found this interesting is 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 72.48 79.88 <NA> i started noticing that we 're very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion and
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 79.96 83.36 <NA> <unk> one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 82.9 86.91 <NA> they 're surviving and i 'm talking specifically about synanthropic species <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 86.91 94.11 <NA> which have adapted specifically for human ecologies species like rats and cockroaches and and crows <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 93.88 102.98 <NA> and as i started looking at them i was finding that they had hyper adapted they 'd become extremely adept at living with us <unk> and in return we just tried to kill them all the time 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 103.33 104.94 <NA> laughter and in doing so we were
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 104.87 107.94 <NA> <unk> breeding them for parasitism we were giving them all sorts of
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 108.56 118.98 <NA> reasons to adapt new ways so for example rats are incredibly responsive breeders and cockroaches as anyone who 's tried to get rid of them knows have become really immune to the poisons that we 're using <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 118.88 120.57 <NA> so i thought 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 120.2 128.95 <NA> let 's build something that 's mutually beneficial something that we can both benefit from and find some way to make a new relationship with these species so i built the vending machine
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 129.72 133.68 <NA> <unk> but the story of the vending machine is is a little more interesting if you know more about crows <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 133.52 143.75 <NA> it turns out crows aren 't just surviving with human beings they 're actually thriving they 're found everywhere on the planet except for the arctic and the southern tip of south america <unk> and in all that area 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 143.7 150.2 <NA> <unk> they 're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings <unk> so we may not think about them but they 're always around
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 150.85 156.59 <NA> <unk> and not surprisingly <unk> given the human population growth more than half of the human population is living in cities now and
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 156.59 163.62 <NA> out of those nine tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities we 're seeing a population boom with crows <unk> so
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 163.26 169.7 <NA> bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers <unk> so that that 's no great surprise <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 169.21 174.9 <NA> but what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 178.88 192.12 <NA> <unk> this is betty she 's a new caledonian crow and these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood here she 's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube <unk> but the researchers had a problem they messed up and left just a stick of wire in there 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 192.12 193.26 <NA> and
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 192.98 197.04 <NA> she hadn 't had the opportunity to do this before you see it wasn 't working very well 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 197.69 204.88 <NA> so she adapted now this is completely unprompted she had never seen this done before no one taught her to
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 204.87 211.34 <NA> <unk> bend this into a hook or had shown her how it could happen but she did it all on her own <unk> so keep in mind she 's never seen this done
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 231.28 239.66 <NA> it turns out we 've been finding more and more that crows are really really intelligent their brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 240.07 254.55 <NA> there 's all kinds of anecdotes for the different kinds of intelligence they have for example in sweden crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice and when the fishermen move off the crows fly down reel up the lines and eat the fish or the the bait it 's pretty annoying for the fishermen
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 255.17 258.85 <NA> an entirely different tack at university of washington a
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 258.64 264.24 <NA> few years ago they were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus some students went out netted some crows <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 264.14 277.51 <NA> brought them in weighed and measured them and let them back out again and they were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week whenever these particular students walked around campus these crows would caw at them and and run around and make make their life kind of miserable
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 280.11 283.15 <NA> <unk> less entertained when this went on for the next week <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 282.69 286.06 <NA> and the next month <unk> and after summer break <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 286.06 293.57 <NA> until they finally graduated and left campus and glad to get away i 'm sure came back sometime later and found the crows still remembered them 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 293.33 297.55 <NA> so the moral being don 't piss off crows <unk> so
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 297.69 303.23 <NA> now students at the university of washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 305.47 306.77 <NA> <unk> fairly interesting 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 308.02 315.32 <NA> so we know these crows are really smart but the more i dug into this the more i found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation video crows have become highly skilled at
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 318.79 324.87 <NA> making a living in these new urban environments in this japanese city <unk> they have
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 325 328.57 <NA> devised a way of eating a food that normally they can 't manage
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 367.83 375.53 <NA> <unk> 's significant about this isn 't that crows are using cars to crack nuts in fact that 's old hat for crows this happened about ten years ago in
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 375.53 379.1 <NA> a place called sendai city at a driving school in the suburbs of tokyo
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 379.84 388.61 <NA> <unk> since that time all the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior now every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk waiting to collect its lunch <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 388.48 394.49 <NA> so they 're learning from each other and research bears this out parents seem to be teaching their young <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 394.06 400.11 <NA> they learn from their peers they learn from their enemies if i have a little extra time i 'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 403.82 410.98 <NA> <unk> they 've developed cultural adaptation <unk> and as we heard yesterday that 's the pandora 's box that 's getting human beings in trouble and we 're starting to see it with them
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 410.74 419.19 <NA> they 're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment <unk> which is really useful if you live in a city <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 420.17 429.52 <NA> so we know that there 's lots of crows <unk> we found out they 're really smart and they can teach each other when all this became clear i realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 430.2 438.16 <NA> <unk> so that 's what we did this is a vending machine for crows and it uses skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages it 's pretty simple 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 437.82 448.12 <NA> basically what happens is that we put this out in a field or someplace where there 's lots of crows we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine crows eventually come by eat the peanuts and get used <unk>
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 448.02 454.97 <NA> <unk> to the machine being there <unk> eventually they eat all the peanuts then they see peanuts here on the feeder tray and hop up and help themselves
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 455.65 465.26 <NA> then they leave the machine spits up more coins and peanuts and life is dandy if you 're a crow you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut <unk> so when they get really used to that we move on
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 464.8 475.17 <NA> to the crows coming back now they 're used to the sound of the machine they keep coming back and digging out peanuts from the pile of coins that 's there <unk> when they get really happy about this we stymie them
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 475.19 482.94 <NA> <unk> move to the third stage where we only give them a coin now like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing this really pisses them off <unk> so
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 482.6 491.37 <NA> they do what they do in nature when they 're looking for something sweep things out of the way with their beak they do that here and that knocks the coins down the slot <unk> when that happens they get a peanut
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 491.36 503.23 <NA> <unk> this goes on for some time the crows learn that all they have to do is show up wait for the coin to come out put it in the slot then get their peanut <unk> when they 're good and comfortable with that we move to the final stage where they show up and nothing happens
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 504.93 510.73 <NA> <unk> is where we see the difference between crows and other animals squirrels for example would show up look for the peanut <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 510.33 518.53 <NA> go away come back look for the peanut <unk> go away they do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored and then they go off and play in traffic
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 518.34 526.55 <NA> <unk> crows on the other hand show up and they try and figure it out they know this machine has been messing with them through three different stages of behavior
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 529.96 534.28 <NA> <unk> so they they poke at it and peck at it and eventually some crow gets a bright idea hey 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 534.12 540.85 <NA> there 's lots of coins lying around from the first stage hops down picks it up drops it in the slot <unk> 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 540.86 548.24 <NA> and we 're off to the races that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts until his friends figure out how to do it and then there we go 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 548.05 554.85 <NA> so what 's significant about this to me isn 't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts mind you there 's two hundred and sixteen
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 554.78 559.95 <NA> <unk> million dollars ' worth of change lost every year <unk> but i 'm not sure i can depend on that roi from crows 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 560.12 563.88 <NA> laughter instead i think we should look a little bit larger 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 563.63 572.71 <NA> i think crows can be trained to do other things for example why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events <unk> or find expensive components from discarded electronics 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 572.71 574.92 <NA> or maybe do search and rescue
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 575.94 588.04 <NA> <unk> the main point of all this for me is we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species we can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn 't involve exterminating them <unk> but involves finding an equilibrium with them that 's a useful balance 
JoshuaKlein_2008 1 JoshuaKlein_2008 587.7 588.86 <NA> thanks very much
