KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 19.78 24.92 <NA> <unk> i like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 24.92 29.97 <NA> so i 'm specifically interested in how we as humans relate to ourselves <unk> each other
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 30.11 31.86 <NA> <unk> and the world around us 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 43.94 54.97 <NA> so just to give you a bit of context as june said i 'm an artist a technologist and an educator <unk> i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics and much of what i do is either
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 54.93 64.48 <NA> <unk> wearable or somehow related to the human form <unk> and so anytime i talk about what i do i like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 64.47 66.46 <NA> and it 's pretty simple <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 66.81 69.1 <NA> everybody 's got one
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 68.82 77.53 <NA> all of you i can guarantee <unk> everyone in this room all of you over there the people in the cushy seats the people up top with the laptops we all have bodies 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 77.28 79.97 <NA> don 't be ashamed <unk> it 's something that
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 79.96 89.64 <NA> <unk> we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world <unk> and so when working as an interaction designer or as an artist who deals with participation
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 89.43 96.32 <NA> creating things that live on in or around the human form it 's really a powerful space to work within 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 96.1 99.75 <NA> so within my own work i use a broad range of
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 100.94 106.23 <NA> <unk> so i communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 106.23 111.48 <NA> and to tell you a bit about the things that i make the easiest place to start the story is with
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 110.99 112.89 <NA> a hat <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 112.85 120.04 <NA> and so it all started several years ago late one night when i was sitting on the subway riding home <unk> and i was thinking <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 120.04 124.99 <NA> and i tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little and so i was thinking about
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 125 135.91 <NA> <unk> how it might be great if i could just take all these noises like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head if i could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that i could share them with somebody else <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 135.78 139.42 <NA> and so i went home and i made a prototype of this hat <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 139.42 149.93 <NA> and i called it the muttering hat because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you but you could detach them and share them with somebody else
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 157.57 163.97 <NA> <unk> so i make other hats as well this one is called the talk to yourself hat it 's fairly <unk>
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 165.25 174.48 <NA> <unk> it physically carves out conversation space for one and when you speak out loud the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 179.99 190.09 <NA> <unk> so when i make these things it 's really not so much about the object itself but rather the negative space around the object so what happens when a person puts this thing on 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 190.04 195.48 <NA> <unk> what kind of an experience do they have and how are they transformed by wearing it 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 197.48 204.97 <NA> so many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves so this this particular device is called the gut listener
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 204.78 211.09 <NA> <unk> listener <unk> and it is a tool that actually enables one to
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 210.6 213.31 <NA> listen to their own innards 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 220.23 229.94 <NA> and so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication and so the inflatable heart is an external organ that
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 230.19 242.33 <NA> can be used by the wearer to express themselves so they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions so they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 244.51 252.51 <NA> and some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences so the discommunicator is a tool for arguments
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 255.01 262.11 <NA> actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 268.25 279.73 <NA> and in the end some of these things just act as invitations <unk> so the ear bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 280.08 291.94 <NA> <unk> so even though i 'm really interested in the relationship between people i also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us <unk> and so when i was first living in new york city a few years back i was thinking a lot about
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 291.45 296.8 <NA> the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how i would like to better relate to them 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 296.64 304.94 <NA> and i thought well hey <unk> maybe if i want to better relate to walls <unk> maybe i need to be more wall like myself so i made a wearable wall
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 305.28 307.67 <NA> that i could wear as a backpack and
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 307.42 315.98 <NA> so i would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that i could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 317.17 320.3 <NA> and so so jumping off of that 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 319.9 329.82 <NA> thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world <unk> i have this ongoing project called botanicalls which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 329.83 337.05 <NA> so when a plant is thirsty it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like twitter <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 337.05 341.91 <NA> and so this really shifts the human plant dynamic <unk> because
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 341.57 348.96 <NA> a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 349.13 354.51 <NA> and so kind of thinking about scale my most recent obsession is actually with
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 355.65 358.72 <NA> of course <unk> and so
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 358.5 367.54 <NA> glaciers are these magnificent beings and there 's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them but what i 'm particularly interested in is in human glacier relations 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 368.88 371.65 <NA> because there seems to be an issue 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 371.25 379.97 <NA> the glaciers are actually leaving us <unk> they 're both shrinking and retreating and some of them have disappeared altogether <unk> and so i actually live in canada
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 379.96 383.39 <NA> <unk> now so i 've been visiting one of my local glaciers and
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 383.19 389.84 <NA> this one 's particularly interesting because of all the glaciers in north america it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 389.38 399.92 <NA> they actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 399.43 403.22 <NA> when i meet a glacier for the very first time 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 403.72 404.94 <NA> what do i do
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 405.41 414.55 <NA> there 's no kind of social protocol for this <unk> i really just don 't even know how to say hello do i
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 414.55 420.16 <NA> carve a message in the snow or perhaps i can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 419.92 429.28 <NA> ice cube morse code or perhaps i need to make myself a speaking tool like an icy megaphone that i can use to amplify my voice when i direct it at the ice
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 430.23 442.63 <NA> but really the most satisfying experience i 've had is the act of listening which is what we need in any good relationship and i was really struck by how much it affected me this very basic shift in my physical orientation
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 442.63 451.4 <NA> helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 451.16 454.94 <NA> these days <unk> i actually made a device called the glacier embracing suit
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 456.88 465.18 <NA> and so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 465.91 469.13 <NA> once again it 's this invitation that
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 468.64 473.96 <NA> asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 476.51 486.22 <NA> <unk> this is actually just the beginning these are initial musings for this project and just as with the wall how i wanted to be more wall like with this project i 'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace <unk> 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 486.22 488.64 <NA> and so my intent is to
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 488.57 493.56 <NA> actually just take the next ten years and
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 493.28 502.93 <NA> go on a series of collaborative projects where i work with people from different disciplines artists technologists scientists to kind of work on this project of how we can improve
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 505.64 508.93 <NA> <unk> so beyond that in closing 
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 508.92 518.48 <NA> i 'd just like to say that we 're in this era of communications and device proliferation and it 's really tremendous and exciting and sexy
KateHartman_2011 1 KateHartman_2011 518.48 528.68 <NA> <unk> but i think what 's really important is thinking about how we can can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world
