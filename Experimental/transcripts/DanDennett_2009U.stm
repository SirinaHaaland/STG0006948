DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 53.31 61.34 <NA> and to express in a few words all mr darwins meaning <unk> who by a strange inversion of reasoning <unk> 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 61.34 68.95 <NA> seems to think absolute ignorance fully qualified to take the place of absolute wisdom in the achievements of creative skill 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 69.54 71.59 <NA> exactly
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 72.33 79.97 <NA> exactly <unk> and it is a strange inversion a creationist pamphlet has
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 79.93 86.72 <NA> <unk> this wonderful page in it test two do you know of any building that didnt have a builder <unk> yes no 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 86.62 95.69 <NA> do you know of any painting that didnt have a painter <unk> yes no <unk> do you know of any car that didnt have a maker <unk> yes no if you answered ' yes '
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 95.2 98.34 <NA> for any of the above <unk> give details
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 104.93 111.93 <NA> you would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer <unk> 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 112.79 115.6 <NA> but darwin shows that its just false <unk> 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 115.6 125.05 <NA> today though im going to talk about darwins other strange inversion which is equally puzzling at first <unk> but in some ways just as important
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 125.88 129.91 <NA> <unk> it stands to reason that we love chocolate cake
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 129.71 137.89 <NA> because it is sweet <unk> guys go for girls like this because they are sexy 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 138.6 146.29 <NA> we adore babies because theyre so cute and of course we are amused by jokes
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 145.98 148.81 <NA> because they are funny <unk> 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 152.07 153.74 <NA> this is all backwards
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 154.9 162.68 <NA> <unk> it is and darwin shows us why <unk> lets start with sweet our sweet tooth
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 162.97 166.94 <NA> is basically an evolved sugar detector 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 166.54 172.85 <NA> because sugar is high energy <unk> and its just been wired up to the preferer to put it very crudely <unk> 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 172.72 178.71 <NA> and thats why we like sugar honey is sweet because we like it not
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 179.87 186.45 <NA> <unk> like it because honey is sweet theres nothing intrinsically sweet
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 186.41 194.58 <NA> about honey if you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind you wouldnt see why they tasted sweet 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 194.69 199.35 <NA> you have to look in our brains to understand why theyre sweet
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 201.42 207.88 <NA> <unk> if you think first there was sweetness <unk> and then we evolved to like sweetness youve got it backwards thats just wrong 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 207.78 212.44 <NA> its the other way round sweetness was born with the wiring
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 212.01 219.52 <NA> which evolved and theres nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies <unk> and its a good thing
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 219.18 227.27 <NA> that there isnt because if there were then mother nature would have a problem how on earth do you get chimps to
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 232.81 234.74 <NA> now you might think ah
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 234.55 238.28 <NA> theres a solution <unk> hallucinations that
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 241.6 245.24 <NA> would be one way of doing it but theres a quicker way 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 245.24 248.87 <NA> just wire the chimps up to love that look 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 249.46 251.84 <NA> and apparently they do
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 251.83 253.38 <NA> thats all there is to
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 256.19 262.51 <NA> <unk> over six million years we and the chimps evolved our different ways we became
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 263.8 271.99 <NA> oddly enough for one reason or another they didnt if we hadnt then probably this would be the height of sexiness
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 279.78 280.83 <NA> <unk> tooth
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 280.4 290.74 <NA> is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food it wasnt designed for chocolate cake chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus the <unk>
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 290.64 304.55 <NA> <unk> term is owed to niko tinbergen who did his famous experiments with gulls where he found that that orange spot on the gulls beak if he made a bigger oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder it was a hyperstimulus for them
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 304.93 310.46 <NA> <unk> they loved it what we see with say chocolate cake is its a supernormal stimulus
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 310.33 312.26 <NA> to tweak
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 311.77 325.05 <NA> our design wiring <unk> and there are lots of supernormal stimuli chocolate cake is one there 's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness <unk> and there 's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness heres a pretty good
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 325.73 331.26 <NA> <unk> its important that we love babies and that we not be put off by say messy diapers 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 331.1 344.43 <NA> so babies have to have to attract our affection and our and our nurturing <unk> and they do and by the way a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 344.66 354.46 <NA> so nature works on many levels here <unk> but now if babies didnt look the way they do if babies looked like this thats what we would find adorable
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 355.52 360.49 <NA> thats what we would find we would think <unk> oh my goodness do i ever want to hug that 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 361.2 366.61 <NA> this is the strange inversion well now finally what about funny <unk> 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 367.05 369.7 <NA> my answer is its the same story 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 369.6 377.51 <NA> the same story this is the hard one the one that isnt obvious thats why i leave it to the end and i wont be able to say too much about it 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 377.51 379.91 <NA> but you have to think evolutionarily
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 379.87 385.61 <NA> <unk> have to think what hard job that has to be done its dirty work somebodys got to do it
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 385.54 387.62 <NA> is so important
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 387.39 393.11 <NA> to give us such a powerful inbuilt reward for it when we succeed 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 393.16 398.42 <NA> now i think we 've found the answer i and a few of my colleagues 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 398.29 403.73 <NA> its a neural system thats wired up to reward the brain
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 403.54 404.97 <NA> for doing a
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 405.07 411.63 <NA> grubby clerical job our bumper sticker for this view is
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 411.32 418.62 <NA> that this is the joy of debugging now im not going to have time to spell it all out but ill just
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 418.37 424.83 <NA> say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward and what were doing is were using
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 424.73 429.49 <NA> humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 429.87 443.15 <NA> <unk> by switching humor on and off by turning the knob on a joke now its not funny oh now its funnier <unk> now well turn a little bit more now its not funny in this way we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain 
DanDennett_2009U 1 DanDennett_2009U 443.15 445.25 <NA> the functional architecture of the brain
