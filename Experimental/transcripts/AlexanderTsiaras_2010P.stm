AlexanderTsiaras_2010P 1 AlexanderTsiaras_2010P 528.99 539.34 <NA> watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us <unk> and it 's not just
AlexanderTsiaras_2010P 1 AlexanderTsiaras_2010P 539.29 550.76 <NA> <unk> our own existence but how does the woman 's body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological cardiovascular
AlexanderTsiaras_2010P 1 AlexanderTsiaras_2010P 554.89 564.79 <NA> treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond again our comprehension the magic that is existence that is us <unk> thank you
