FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 15.01 24.75 <NA> <unk> thrilled to be here i 'm going to talk about a new old material that still continues to amaze us <unk> and that might impact the way we think about material
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 25.79 35.91 <NA> <unk> high technology and maybe along the way also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation so that 's kind of a bold statement i 'll tell you a little bit more this material actually has some traits <unk>
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 35.81 42.58 <NA> <unk> that make it seem almost too good to be true <unk> it 's sustainable it 's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 50.4 58.78 <NA> <unk> it 's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response it actually gets reintegrated in the body and it 's technological so it can do things like
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 58.32 63.04 <NA> microelectronics and maybe photonics do and the material
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 62.7 64.93 <NA> looks something like this 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 66 74.71 <NA> in fact this material you see is clear and transparent the components of this material are just water and protein <unk> so this material is is silk
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 76.15 83.96 <NA> <unk> so it 's kind of different from what we 're used to thinking about silk <unk> so the question is how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 84.07 92.27 <NA> the process of discovery generally is inspired by nature <unk> and so we marvel at silk worms the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 92.27 104.16 <NA> the silk worm does a remarkable thing it uses these two ingredients protein and water that are in its gland to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection so comparable to to technical fibers like
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 105.04 114.4 <NA> <unk> and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about and that we 're familiar with for the textile industry the textile industry goes
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 114.4 116.37 <NA> and unwinds the cocoon
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 115.94 125.26 <NA> and then weaves glamorous things we want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid kevlar to this natural kevlar so the insight
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 126.33 128.95 <NA> <unk> is how do you actually reverse engineer this
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 128.78 138.34 <NA> and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material and this is an insight that came about two decades ago 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 137.91 140 <NA> from a person that i 'm very
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 139.84 141.04 <NA> very
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 140.7 150.02 <NA> fortunate to work with david kaplan <unk> and so we get this starting material <unk> and so this starting material is back to the basic building block and then we use this
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 150.19 157.82 <NA> <unk> to do a variety of things like for example this film and we take advantage of something that is very simple the recipe to make those films is
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 157.51 166.44 <NA> is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do they find their way to self assemble so the recipe is simple you take the silk solution you pour it 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 166.23 168.9 <NA> and you wait for the protein to self assemble 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 168.9 178.68 <NA> and then you detach the protein and you get this film as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates <unk> but i mentioned that the film is also technological and so what does that mean it means that
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 180.02 191.58 <NA> you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology like microelectronics and nanoscale technology and the image of the dvd here is just to illustrate a point that that silk
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 191.18 199.62 <NA> silk follows very very subtle topographies of the surface which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale so it would be able to replicate the information
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 199.62 201.97 <NA> that is on the dvd <unk> 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 201.76 204.28 <NA> and we can store information
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 205.08 213.19 <NA> <unk> and protein so we tried something out and we wrote a message in a piece of silk which is right here and the message is over there and much like in the dvd you can read it out optically <unk> 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 213.19 218.35 <NA> and this requires a stable hand so this is why i decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 218.37 225.11 <NA> so let me see so as you see the film go in transparently through there and then
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 237.85 242.24 <NA> <unk> and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 242.02 245.28 <NA> so once you have
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 245.28 253.43 <NA> these these attributes of this material then you can do a lot of things it 's actually not limited to films <unk> and so the material can assume
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 252.97 254.1 <NA> a lot of formats
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 254.99 265.8 <NA> <unk> crazy and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes or you can do beautiful things that if the camera can capture you can make
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 265.8 268.36 <NA> you can add a third dimensionality to
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 268.12 273.45 <NA> to the film and if the angle is right you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk <unk> 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 275.6 279.82 <NA> but you can do other things you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 279.99 290.56 <NA> <unk> we 've made optical fibers but silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics <unk> and you can think of different formats so for instance if you 're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle we do microneedle <unk>
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 290.46 297.31 <NA> <unk> arrays what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that 's made of silk just to give you a sense of size <unk> 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 304.93 315.21 <NA> <unk> the gears work in water as well so you think of of alternative mechanical parts and maybe you can use that liquid kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins for example <unk> 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 315.16 321.84 <NA> <unk> or maybe an entire bone <unk> and so you have here a little example of a small skull what we
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 326.51 338.8 <NA> <unk> you can do things like cups for example <unk> and so if you add a little bit of gold if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods you can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 338.8 339.82 <NA> or
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 339.34 348 <NA> if you 're fashion forward some silk led tattoos so there 's versatility <unk> as you see in the material formats 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 347.63 353.35 <NA> that you can do with silk but there are still some unique traits i mean why would you want to do all these things
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 354.98 362.35 <NA> i mentioned it briefly at the beginning the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible and you see here a picture of a tissue section <unk> 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 362.15 373 <NA> and so what does that mean that it 's biodegradable and biocompatible you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted which means that all the devices that you 've seen before and all the formats in principle <unk>
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 372.95 379.85 <NA> can be implanted and disappear and what you see there in that tissue section in fact is you see that reflector tape
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 379.93 382.01 <NA> <unk> much like you 're seen at night
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 382.09 396.14 <NA> by a car then the idea is that you can see if you illuminate tissue you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk and you see there it gets reintegrated in tissue and reintegration in the human body is not the only thing
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 396.07 399.75 <NA> <unk> but reintegration in the environment is important so you have a
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 400.46 406.2 <NA> <unk> you have protein and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 412.85 415.47 <NA> unlike the polystyrene cups
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 415.16 425.11 <NA> that that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday <unk> it 's edible <unk> so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 425.07 427.49 <NA> <unk> it doesn 't taste good so
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 427.31 429.06 <NA> i 'm going to need some help with that 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 429.06 439.55 <NA> but probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle silk <unk> during its self assembly process <unk> acts like a cocoon for biological matter and so if you change the recipe and you add things
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 439.36 443 <NA> when you pour so you add things to your liquid silk solution
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 442.52 448.27 <NA> where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines <unk>
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 447.9 454.85 <NA> the self assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants <unk> so it makes the materials environmentally
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 454.78 462.05 <NA> <unk> active and interactive <unk> so that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 461.68 469.43 <NA> screw a bone together a fractured bone together and deliver drugs at the same <unk> while your bone is healing for example 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 469.99 472.61 <NA> or you could put drugs in your wallet
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 472.18 479.94 <NA> and not in your fridge so we 've made a silk card with penicillin in it and we stored penicillin at sixty degrees c so one hundred and
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 479.9 485.76 <NA> <unk> forty degrees fahrenheit for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin <unk> and so that could be 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 490.43 495.13 <NA> that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 495.13 499.99 <NA> and of course there 's no use in storage if you can 't use [ it ] and so there is this
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 502.83 506.56 <NA> <unk> that these materials have that they 're programmably degradable
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 506.1 516.67 <NA> and so what you see there is the difference in the top you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade and in the bottom a film that has been programmed to degrade in water and what you see is that the film on the bottom releases
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 516.18 524.36 <NA> what is inside it so it allows for the recovery of what we 've stored before and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 524.36 529.97 <NA> for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you 've seen so the thread of discovery that we
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 529.93 535.31 <NA> <unk> have really is a thread <unk> we 're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do whether you want to
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 534.97 539.66 <NA> replace a vein or a bone or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics 
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 539.17 549.99 <NA> perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt maybe carry your drugs in your pocket deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert the answer
FioOmenetto_2011 1 FioOmenetto_2011 550 552.49 <NA> <unk> may be in a thread of silk thank you
