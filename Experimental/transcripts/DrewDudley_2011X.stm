DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 15.7 19.31 <NA> <unk> many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 20.32 27.78 <NA> see i 've asked that question all the way across the country and everywhere i ask it no matter where there 's always a huge portion of the audience that won 't put up their hand
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 27.78 29.94 <NA> and i 've come to realize that we have made leadership
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 29.95 40.08 <NA> into something bigger than us we 've made into something beyond us we 've made it about changing the world and we 've taken this title of leader and we treat it as if it 's something that one day we 're going to deserve but <unk>
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 39.98 54.91 <NA> <unk> to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we 're not comfortable with and i worry sometimes that we spend so much time celebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do that we 've convinced ourselves that those are the only things worth celebrating and we start to devalue the things that
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 54.96 62.41 <NA> <unk> can do every day and we start to take moments where we truly are a leader and we don 't let ourselves take credit for it and we don 't let ourselves feel good about it
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 61.98 75.59 <NA> and i 've been lucky enough over the last ten years to work with some amazing people who have helped me redefine leadership in a way that i think has made me happier and with my short time today i just want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 75.59 79.97 <NA> i went to school in a little school called mount allison university in sackville new brunswick
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 80.01 85.43 <NA> and on my last day there a girl came up to me and she said i remember the first time that i met you
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 85.09 89.12 <NA> and then she told me a story that had happened four years earlier she said
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 88.72 99.05 <NA> on the day before i started university i was in the hotel room with my mom and my dad and i was so scared and so convinced that i couldn 't do this that i wasn 't ready for university that i just burst into tears and my <unk>
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 98.95 105 <NA> <unk> mom and my dad were amazing they were like look we know you 're scared but let 's just go tomorrow let 's go to the first day and if at any point
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 105.13 110.08 <NA> you feel as if you can 't do this that 's fine just tell us we will take you home we love you no matter what
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 109.84 117.88 <NA> and she says so i went the next day and i was standing in line getting ready for registration and i looked around and i just knew i couldn 't do it i knew i wasn 't ready i knew i had to quit
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 117.88 122.71 <NA> and she says i made that decision and as soon as i made it there was this incredible feeling of peace that came over me
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 122.47 129.94 <NA> and i turned to my mom and my dad to tell them that we needed to go home and just at that moment you came out of the student union building wearing the stupidest hat
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 129.96 133.18 <NA> <unk> i have ever seen in my life laughter it was awesome
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 133.11 134.73 <NA> and you had a big sign

DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 145.02 148.58 <NA> and all of a sudden you got to me and you just stopped
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 148.37 153.53 <NA> and you stared it was creepy laughter this girl right here knows exactly what
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 155.05 168.31 <NA> <unk> and then you looked at the guy next to me and you smiled and you reached in your bucket and you pulled out a lollipop and you held it out to him and you said you need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman standing next to you and she said i have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 168.31 172.61 <NA> he turned beet red and he wouldn 't even look at me he just kind of held the lollipop out like this laughter
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 173.98 179.94 <NA> and i felt so bad for this dude that i took the lollipop and as soon as i did you got this incredibly severe look on your face
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 179.99 187.89 <NA> <unk> and you looked at my mom and my dad and you said look at that look at that first day away from home and already she 's taking candy from a stranger laughter
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 189.26 193.63 <NA> and she said everybody lost it twenty feet in every direction everyone started to howl
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 193.63 203.28 <NA> and i know this is cheesy and i don 't know why i 'm telling you this but in that moment when everyone was laughing i knew that i shouldn 't quit i knew that i was where i was supposed to be and i knew that i was home
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 202.79 205 <NA> and i haven 't spoken to you once in
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 204.96 214 <NA> <unk> the four years since that day but i heard that you were leaving and i had to come up and tell you that you 've been an incredibly important person in my life and i 'm going to miss you good luck
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 213.69 216.02 <NA> and she walks away and i 'm flattened
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 216.02 222.4 <NA> and she gets about six feet away she turns around and smiles and goes you should probably know this too i 'm still dating that guy four years later laughter
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 223.53 230 <NA> a year and a half after i moved to toronto i got an invitation to their wedding here 's the kicker
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 229.72 232.37 <NA> <unk> kicker i don 't remember that
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 232 238.55 <NA> i have no recollection of that moment and i 've searched my memory banks because that is funny and i should remember doing it and i don 't remember it
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 238.15 252.05 <NA> and that was such an eye opening transformative moment for me to think that that maybe the biggest impact i 'd ever had on anyone 's life a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say you 've been an incredibly important person in my life was a moment that i didn 't even remember
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 251.68 254.97 <NA> how many of you guys have a lollipop moment a moment where someone said
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 254.99 262.02 <NA> <unk> something or did something that you feel fundamentally made your life better all right how many of you have told that person they did it
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 262.49 268.29 <NA> see why not we celebrate birthdays where all you have to do is not die for three hundred and sixty five days laughter
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 268.76 279.97 <NA> and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it and every single one of you every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment you have made someone 's life better by something that you said or that you did and

DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 285.61 300.02 <NA> but it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful it can be frightening to think that we can matter that much to other people because as long as we make leadership something bigger than us as long as we keep leadership something beyond us as long as we make it about changing the world we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 300 302.15 <NA> from ourselves and from each other
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 301.81 311.72 <NA> marianne williamson said our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light and not our darkness that frightens us and my call to action today <unk>
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 311.62 321.75 <NA> <unk> is that we need to get over that we need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other 's lives we need to get over it so we can move beyond it and our little brothers and our little sisters and one day our kids
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 330.02 338.13 <NA> <unk> leadership as being about lollipop moments how many of them we create how many of them we acknowledge how many of them we pay forward and how many of them we say thank you for
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 337.7 347.92 <NA> because we 've made leadership about changing the world and there is no world there 's only six billion understandings of it and if you change one person 's understanding of it one person 's understanding of what they 're capable of
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 347.87 354.82 <NA> <unk> one person 's understanding of how much people care about them one person 's understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 354.87 363.16 <NA> <unk> you 've changed the whole thing and if we can understand leadership like that i think if we can redefine leadership like that i think we can change everything
DrewDudley_2011X 1 DrewDudley_2011X 362.94 367.91 <NA> and it 's a simple idea but i don 't think it 's a small one and i want to thank you all so much for letting me share
