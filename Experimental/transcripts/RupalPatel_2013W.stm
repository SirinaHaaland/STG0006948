RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 76.36 79.2 <NA> <unk> there are two point five million americans

RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 142.67 146.95 <NA> it really struck me <unk> and i wanted to do something about this <unk>

RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 174.19 179.97 <NA> so what i wanted to do next is i wanted to find out how we could harness these residual

RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 181.18 187.76 <NA> and build a technology that could be customized for them <unk> voices that could be customized for them <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 187.54 193.65 <NA> so i reached out to my collaborator tim bunnell dr bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 193.65 197.89 <NA> and what he 'd been doing is building personalized voices for people
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 197.68 199.93 <NA> by putting together
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 200.55 208.03 <NA> <unk> samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them <unk> these are people who had lost their voice later in life 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 207.84 213.88 <NA> we didn 't have the luxury of pre recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 213.51 223.36 <NA> but i thought there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever little is left over <unk> so we decided to do exactly that 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 222.99 227.39 <NA> we set out with a little bit of funding from the national science foundation to create
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 230.19 236.81 <NA> their unique vocal identities <unk> we call this project vocalid or vocal i d for vocal identity <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 236.77 244.67 <NA> now before i get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it i need to give you a real quick speech science lesson 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 244.21 250.95 <NA> okay so first we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 250.95 254.85 <NA> children sound different from teens who sound different from adults
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 254.99 256.92 <NA> <unk> 've all experienced this 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 257.24 263.31 <NA> fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 262.85 270.99 <NA> which is the vibrations generated by your voice box <unk> which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 270.99 273.64 <NA> these are the chambers of your head and neck
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 273.47 274.96 <NA> that vibrate <unk> and
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 275 281.14 <NA> <unk> actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels so the combination
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 281.14 290.15 <NA> of source and filter is how we produce speech and that happens in one individual now
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 289.73 293.71 <NA> i told you earlier that i 'd spent a good part of my career
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 293.51 300.25 <NA> understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 299.82 304.58 <NA> and what i 've found is that even though their filters were impaired
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 305.32 314.78 <NA> <unk> they were able to modulate their source the pitch the loudness the tempo of their voice <unk> these are called prosody <unk> and i 've been documenting for years
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 314.78 319.85 <NA> that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved <unk> so
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 319.96 325.17 <NA> when i realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 325.61 327.15 <NA> <unk> i had this idea
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 326.84 336.07 <NA> <unk> why don 't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like because it 's preserved <unk> and borrow the filter
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 335.62 343.23 <NA> from someone about the same age and size <unk> because they can articulate speech <unk> and then mix them <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 342.89 348.73 <NA> because when we mix them <unk> we can get a voice that 's as clear as our surrogate talker
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 348.49 349.93 <NA> that 's the person we borrowed the
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 352.41 359.71 <NA> <unk> similar in identity to our target talker <unk> it 's that simple that 's the science behind what we 're doing <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 359.82 365.84 <NA> so once you have that in mind how do you go about building this voice <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 365.84 369.46 <NA> well you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 369.54 379.97 <NA> it 's not such an ominous thing being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances the process goes something like
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 379.96 387.83 <NA> <unk> this voice things happen in pairs <unk> i love to sleep the sky is blue without clouds 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 388.51 397.79 <NA> rp now she 's going to go on like this for about three to four hours <unk> and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 397.78 404.06 <NA> but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 404.78 413.58 <NA> <unk> speech you have the better sounding voice you 're going to have once you have those recordings what we need to do is we have to parse these
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 413.12 420.74 <NA> recordings into little snippets of speech one or two sound combinations sometimes even whole words
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 420.74 424.47 <NA> that start populating a dataset or a database we 're
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 425.34 428.56 <NA> <unk> going to call this database a voice bank 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 428.34 437.89 <NA> now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank <unk> we can now say any new utterance like i love chocolate everyone needs to be able to say that
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 437.73 443.71 <NA> fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance voice 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 443.46 445.49 <NA> i love chocolate rp 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 445.49 454.37 <NA> so that 's speech synthesis it 's called concatenative synthesis and that 's what we 're using that 's not the novel part what 's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 454.96 458.57 <NA> <unk> this is samantha <unk> i met her when she was nine
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 458.41 463.46 <NA> <unk> and since then my team and i have been trying to build her a personalized voice <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 463.09 469.99 <NA> we first had to find a surrogate donor <unk> and then we had to have samantha produce some utterances 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 469.99 477.17 <NA> what she can produce are mostly vowel like sounds but that 's enough for us to extract her source characteristics 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 477.34 479.91 <NA> what happens next is best
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 479.81 488.07 <NA> <unk> described by my daughter 's analogy <unk> she 's six she calls it mixing colors to paint voices it
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 488.42 499.33 <NA> 's beautiful it 's exactly that samantha 's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 511.2 517.37 <NA> <unk> this voice is only for me <unk> i can 't wait to use my new voice with my friends
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 529.81 533.48 <NA> <unk> across her face when she heard that voice for the first time 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 534.25 539.4 <NA> now there 's millions of people around the world like samantha millions <unk> 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 539.4 554.37 <NA> and we 've only begun to scratch the surface <unk> what we 've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the u s who have donated their voices <unk> and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 555.74 566.31 <NA> but there 's so much more work to be done for samantha her surrogate came from somewhere in the midwest a stranger who gave her the gift of voice 
RupalPatel_2013W 1 RupalPatel_2013W 566.75 573.78 <NA> and as a scientist <unk> i 'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have <unk>
