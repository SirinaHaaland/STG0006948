RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 12.49 18.41 <NA> <unk> the recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 18.4 25.05 <NA> has been very emotional and i think some dispassionate quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 25.82 35.7 <NA> <unk> therefore like to propose that we employ we enlist the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject for instance just recently
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 35.3 43.05 <NA> the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses fifty eight billion dollars a year to copyright theft
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 42.71 54.79 <NA> <unk> now rather than just argue about this number a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he 'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 54.75 57.88 <NA> <unk> westin <unk> and then to mars 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 59.73 61.96 <NA> if we use pennies <unk> 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 62.82 67.59 <NA> now this is obviously a powerful some might say dangerously powerful insight 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 67.59 79.97 <NA> but it 's also a morally important one because this isn 't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we 're talking about but this is actual economic losses this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 80.05 89.15 <NA> <unk> failing along with all of our fruit crops as well as wheat tobacco <unk> rice sorghum whatever sorghum is
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 88.87 90.8 <NA> losing sorghum <unk> 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 91.87 104.97 <NA> but identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since napster first came on the scene so that 's a chunk of what
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 104.96 110.65 <NA> <unk> we 're looking for <unk> but total movie revenues across theaters home video and pay per view are up <unk> 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 110.41 117.61 <NA> and tv satellite and cable revenues are way up <unk> other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up <unk> 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 117.61 121.62 <NA> so this small missing chunk here is puzzling 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 127.25 129.97 <NA> since the big content markets have grown in
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 129.9 140.11 <NA> <unk> line with historic norms it 's not additional growth that piracy has prevented but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that <unk>
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 140.01 148.18 <NA> <unk> has no historic norms one that didn 't exist in the ninety 's what we 're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 151.11 154.88 <NA> fifty billion dollars of it a year <unk> which is enough at
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 154.84 159.89 <NA> <unk> thirty seconds a ringtone that could stretch from here to neanderthal times it 's

RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 171.79 179.97 <NA> the movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over three hundred and seventy thousand jobs to content theft which is quite a lot when you consider
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 180.02 187.56 <NA> <unk> that back in ' ninety eight the bureau of labor statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing two hundred and seventy thousand people
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 187.91 200.08 <NA> <unk> other data has the music industry at about forty five thousand people and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries and this is just one of the many
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 201.6 206.35 <NA> <unk> that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day and some people think that string theory is tough 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 207.96 219.23 <NA> now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians ' toolkit it 's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated <unk> 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 219.23 223.01 <NA> hollywood and congress derived this number mathematically
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 222.82 229.97 <NA> back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law some people think this number 's a little bit large
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 230.14 236.78 <NA> <unk> but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn 't get compounded for inflation every year <unk> 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 237.13 248.52 <NA> now when this law first passed the world 's hottest mp3 player could hold just ten songs <unk> and it was a big christmas hit because what little hoodlum wouldn 't want a million and a half bucks worth of stolen goods in his pocket
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 256.31 264.57 <NA> <unk> these days an ipod classic can hold forty thousand songs which is to say eight billion dollars worth of stolen media 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 266.3 269.19 <NA> or about seventy five thousand jobs 
RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 275.36 279.85 <NA> now you might find copyright math strange but that 's because it 's a

RobReid_2012 1 RobReid_2012 282.3 293.54 <NA> so that 's it for now i hope you 'll join me next time when i will be making an equally scientific and fact based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he american economy <unk> thank you very much
