HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1044.04 1052.09 <NA> any institution doesn 't respect the rules in the criminal code of germany it 's written that it 's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1055.16 1060.1 <NA> in the criminal code of germany <unk> so if it 's not respected then
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1059.85 1073.82 <NA> i think an investigation is necessary <unk> and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of germany started this and he started it only in the case of angela merkel and not in the case of all the other people living in germany
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1080.11 1086.06 <NA> <unk> because of the story you told seen from the outside i live outside of germany and i expected the germans to react <unk>
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1087.15 1096.65 <NA> much more strongly <unk> immediately and instead <unk> the reaction really came only when chancellor merkel was revealed as being wiretapped why so hk 
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1097 1100.95 <NA> i take it as a good sign because people feel
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1100.74 1102.81 <NA> secure in this democracy
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1104.87 1108.98 <NA> <unk> will be arrested and if you leave this hall after the conference 
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1108.99 1118.42 <NA> nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you so that 's a good sign i think people are not really scared as they could be 
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1118.21 1120.15 <NA> but of course i think <unk> 
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1119.84 1122.1 <NA> the institutions
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1122.18 1129.55 <NA> are responsible to stop illegal actions in germany or wherever they happen bg a personal question
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1130.08 1133.67 <NA> <unk> and this is the last one <unk> there has been a debate in germany about
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1133.43 1137.62 <NA> granting asylum to edward snowden would you be in favor or against hk oh 
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1138.12 1144.43 <NA> that 's a difficult question but if you ask me <unk> and if i answer honestly i would give him the
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1144.43 1151.61 <NA> asylum because i think it was really brave what he did and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything 
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1151.38 1154.4 <NA> so i think for these people we should do something
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1154.96 1156.65 <NA> <unk> and especially
HubertusKnabe_2014S 1 HubertusKnabe_2014S 1156.73 1166.47 <NA> if you see the german history <unk> where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn 't get it so it would be a good sign to give him
