BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 201.9 209.53 <NA> <unk> the failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than ebola
BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 210.03 214.84 <NA> let 's look at the progression of ebola over this year 
BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 215.58 222.94 <NA> about ten thousand people died <unk> and nearly all were in the three west african countries <unk> 
BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 223.14 229.97 <NA> there 's three reasons why it didn 't spread more the first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers
BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 230.25 239.3 <NA> they found the people and they prevented more infections the second is the nature of the virus ebola does not spread through the air <unk> 
BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 238.99 244.64 <NA> and by the time you 're contagious most people are so sick that they 're bedridden <unk>

BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 254.9 262.92 <NA> <unk> case numbers would have been much larger <unk> so next time we might not be so lucky you can have a virus

BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 269.39 279.25 <NA> the source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like ebola or it could be bioterrorism so there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse
BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 280.05 282.56 <NA> <unk> let 's look at a model
BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 282.35 289.42 <NA> of a virus spread through the air <unk> like the spanish flu back in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen

BillGates_2015 1 BillGates_2015 372.93 379.79 <NA> what are the key pieces <unk> first we need strong health systems in poor countries
