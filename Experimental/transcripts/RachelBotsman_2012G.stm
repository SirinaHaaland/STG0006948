RachelBotsman_2012G 1 RachelBotsman_2012G 705.28 711.83 <NA> what the likes of sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is shouldn 't they own their reputation data

RachelBotsman_2012G 1 RachelBotsman_2012G 777.94 779.94 <NA> the big challenge is

RachelBotsman_2012G 1 RachelBotsman_2012G 874.28 879.61 <NA> also more so than our credit history we can actually shape our reputation
RachelBotsman_2012G 1 RachelBotsman_2012G 879.9 885.85 <NA> <unk> just think of sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his now
RachelBotsman_2012G 1 RachelBotsman_2012G 885.36 891.41 <NA> privacy issues aside the other really interesting issue i 'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts
