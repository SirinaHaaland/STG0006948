DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 12.43 19.34 <NA> <unk> the word concussion evokes a fear these days more so than it ever has and i know this personally <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 19.33 25.79 <NA> i played ten years of football was struck in the head thousands of times <unk> and
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 25.42 29.97 <NA> i have to tell you though what was much worse than that was a pair of bike
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 29.96 37.92 <NA> <unk> accidents i had where i suffered concussions <unk> and i 'm still dealing with the effects of the most recent one today as i stand in front of you 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 39.23 44.67 <NA> there is a fear around concussion that does have some evidence behind it 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 45.17 54.04 <NA> there is information that a repeated history of concussion can lead to early dementia such as alzheimer 's and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 54.81 57.85 <NA> <unk> subject of the will smith movie concussion 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 58.11 69.67 <NA> and so everybody is caught up in football and what they see in the military but you may not know that bike riding is the leading cause of concussion for kids sports related concussion that is <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 70.59 78.98 <NA> and so another thing that i should tell you that you may not know is that the helmets that are worn in bicycling and football and many activities
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 79.96 89.13 <NA> <unk> not designed or tested for how well they can protect your children against concussion they 're in fact designed and tested for their ability to
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 89.13 95.81 <NA> protect against skull fracture <unk> and so i get this question all the time
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 95.62 99.96 <NA> from parents and they ask me would you let your own
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 101.84 105.49 <NA> <unk> should i let my child play soccer and
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 105.28 112.35 <NA> i think that as a field we 're a long way from giving an answer with any kind of confidence there <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 112.97 120.72 <NA> so i look at that question from a bit of a different lens <unk> and i want to know how can we prevent concussion 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 120.29 122.4 <NA> is that even possible 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 122 125.05 <NA> and most experts think that it 's not
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 126.51 137.05 <NA> <unk> but the work that we 're doing in my lab is starting to reveal more of the details around concussion so that we can have a better understanding <unk> the reason we 're able <unk>
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 137 143.47 <NA> to prevent skull fracture with helmets is because it 's pretty simple we know how it works concussion has been much more of a mystery 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 155.17 160.01 <NA> <unk> the cdc website comes up and this video essentially tells the whole story what
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 159.88 162.57 <NA> you see is the head moves forward 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 162.57 175.19 <NA> the brain lags behind then the brain catches up and smashes into the skull <unk> it rebounds off the skull and then proceeds to run into the other side of the skull 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 174.88 179.82 <NA> and what you 'll notice is highlighted in this video from the cdc <unk> which i 'll note was
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 179.81 182.59 <NA> <unk> funded by the nfl is that the
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 182.41 185.32 <NA> outer surface of the brain <unk> where it
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 185.11 191.32 <NA> was to have smashed into the skull <unk> looks like it 's been damaged or injured so it 's on the outer surface of the brain 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 191.32 195.34 <NA> and what i 'd like to do with this video is to tell you
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 195.11 199.99 <NA> that there are some aspects that are probably right indicative of what the scientists think happens with concussion <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 200.19 203.88 <NA> <unk> probably more that 's wrong with this video <unk> so
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 203.69 215.14 <NA> one thing that i do agree with and i think most experts would is that the brain does have these dynamics it does lag behind the skull and then catch up and move back and forth and oscillate that we think is true 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 215.31 219.14 <NA> however the amount of motion you see in the brain in this video
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 218.9 224.9 <NA> is is probably not right at all there 's very little room in the cranial vault only a few
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 226.06 235.94 <NA> <unk> 's filled entirely with cerebral spinal fluid <unk> which acts as a protective layer <unk> and so the brain as a whole probably moves very little inside the skull <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 236.05 245.48 <NA> the other problem with this video is that the brain is shown as a kind of rigid whole as it moves around and that 's not true either 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 245.2 250.02 <NA> your brain is one of the softest substances in your body <unk> and you can think of it kind
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 251.15 259.77 <NA> <unk> so as your head is moving back and forth your brain is twisting and turning and contorting and the tissue is getting stretched <unk> and so
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 259.58 270.27 <NA> most experts i think would agree that concussion is not likely to be something that 's happening on this outer surface of the brain <unk> but rather it 's something that 's much deeper towards the center of the brain <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 270.8 274.87 <NA> now the way that we 're approaching this problem to try to understand the
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 275.91 282.49 <NA> <unk> and to figure out if we can prevent it is we are using a device like this it 's a <unk> mouthguard 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 282.51 292.61 <NA> it has sensors in it that are essentially the same that are in your cell phone accelerometers <unk> gyroscopes <unk> and when someone is struck in the head it can tell you
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 292.25 297.4 <NA> how their head moved at a thousand samples per second <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 298.29 304.97 <NA> the principle behind the mouthguard is this it fits onto your teeth your teeth are one of the hardest substances
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 304.99 312.32 <NA> <unk> in your body <unk> so it rigidly couples to your skull and gives you the most precise possible measurement of how the skull moves 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 311.83 322.28 <NA> people have tried other approaches with helmets we 've looked at other sensors that go on your skin <unk> and they all simply move around too much and so we found that this <unk>
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 322.18 325.25 <NA> <unk> is the only reliable way to take a good measurement 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 326.95 329.94 <NA> so now that we 've got this device
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 329.93 335.19 <NA> <unk> we can go beyond studying cadavers because you can only learn so much about concussion from studying a cadaver <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 334.7 344.47 <NA> and we want to learn and study live humans <unk> so where can we find a group of willing volunteers to go out and smash their heads
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 344.14 352.89 <NA> into each other on a regular basis and sustain concussion <unk> well i was one of them <unk> and it 's your local friendly stanford football team <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 353.18 354.91 <NA> so this is our laboratory
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 354.95 361.9 <NA> and i want to show you the first concussion we measured with this device one of the things that i should point out
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 361.73 372.46 <NA> is the device has this gyroscope in it and that allows you to measure the rotation of the head most experts think that that 's the critical factor that might start to tell us what is happening in concussion 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 372.03 373.7 <NA> so please watch this video
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 408.71 410.28 <NA> <unk> a little excessive there <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 410.24 418.63 <NA> but you get the idea <unk> so when you look at just the film here pretty much the only thing you can see is he got hit really hard and he was hurt <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 418.63 425.14 <NA> but when we extract the data out of the mouthguard that he was wearing we can see much more detail much richer information
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 425.58 427.88 <NA> <unk> and one of the things that we noticed here
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 427.7 439.06 <NA> is that he was struck in the lower left side of his face mask <unk> and so that did something first that was a little counterintuitive his head did not move to the right in fact it rotated first to the left 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 438.57 445.91 <NA> then as the neck began to compress <unk> the force of the blow caused it to whip back to the right <unk> so
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 445.72 448.3 <NA> this left right motion was sort of a <unk>
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 449.84 454.67 <NA> phenomenon and we think that is probably what led to the brain injury
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 454.87 462.05 <NA> this device is only limited in such that it can measure the skull motion but what we really want to know is what 's happening inside of the brain <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 461.74 469.4 <NA> so we collaborate with svein kleiven 's group in sweden they 've developed a finite element model of the brain <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 469.21 477.42 <NA> and so this is a simulation using the data from our mouthguard from the injury i just showed you and what you see is the brain this
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 480.16 485.19 <NA> the brain twisting and contorting as i mentioned so you can see this doesn 't look a lot like the cdc video 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 485.19 491.31 <NA> now the colors that you 're looking at are how much the brain tissue is being stretched <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 490.88 498.06 <NA> and so the red is fifty percent that means the brain has been stretched to fifty percent of its original length the tissue in that particular area <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 497.57 504.97 <NA> and the main thing i want to draw your attention to is this red spot so the red spot is very close to the center of the brain
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 505.1 511.09 <NA> and relatively speaking you don 't see a lot of of colors like that on the exterior surface
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 510.89 519.09 <NA> as the cdc video showed now to explain a little more detail about how we think concussion
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 518.93 528.76 <NA> might be happening one thing i should mention is that we and others have observed that a concussion is more likely when you 're struck and your head rotates in this direction 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 528.45 529.97 <NA> this is more common
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 530.08 534.08 <NA> <unk> in sports like football but this seems to be more dangerous so what might be happening there <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 533.8 544.04 <NA> well one thing that you 'll notice in the human brain that is different than other animals is we have these two very large lobes we have the right brain and the left brain 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 543.61 553.19 <NA> and the key thing to notice in this figure here is that right down the center of the right brain and the left brain there 's a large fissure that goes deep into the brain <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 553.19 554.28 <NA> and in that fissure
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 555.16 564.99 <NA> in this image you 'll have to trust me there is a fibrous sheet of tissue it 's called the falx and it runs from the front of your head all the way to the back of your head and it 's quite stiff <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 564.86 566.4 <NA> and so
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 565.91 575.11 <NA> what that allows for is when you 're struck and your head rotates in this left right direction <unk> forces can rapidly transmit right down to the center of your brain
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 575.88 578.47 <NA> <unk> what 's there at the bottom of this fissure it
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 578.67 581.44 <NA> 's the wiring of your brain 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 581.19 593.08 <NA> and in fact this red bundle here at the bottom of that fissure is the single largest fiber bundle that is the wiring that connects the right and left sides of your brain 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 593.08 595.03 <NA> it 's called the corpus callosum 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 595.02 599.96 <NA> and we think that this might be one of the most common mechanisms of
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 602.41 611.39 <NA> <unk> as the forces move down they strike the corpus callosum <unk> it causes a dissociation between your right and your left brain and could explain some of the symptoms of concussion 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 612.25 619.43 <NA> this finding is also consistent of what we 've seen in this brain disease that i mentioned chronic traumatic encephalopathy <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 619.09 621.95 <NA> so this is an image of a <unk>
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 623.8 629.28 <NA> <unk> football player and the thing that i want to point out is if you look at the corpus callosum and
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 629.9 639.06 <NA> <unk> back here so you can see the size of a normal corpus callosum and the size of the person here who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy <unk> it is
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 638.57 649.87 <NA> greatly atrophied and the same goes for all of the space in the ventricles these ventricles are much larger <unk> and so all of this tissue near the center of the brain has died off over time so what we 're
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 654.21 656.14 <NA> <unk> there is some good news here <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 655.77 659.54 <NA> and i hope to give you a sense of hope by the end of this talk
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 659.54 668.18 <NA> one of the things that we 've noticed specifically about this mechanism of injury is although there 's a rapid transmission of the forces down this fissure <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 667.99 671.38 <NA> it still takes a defined amount of time 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 671.01 675.14 <NA> and what we think is that if we can slow the head down just
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 676.93 680.49 <NA> <unk> the brain does not lag behind the skull but instead it moves
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 680.31 685.46 <NA> in synchrony with the skull <unk> then we might be able to prevent this mechanism of concussion 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 685.51 689.09 <NA> so how can we slow the head down 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 691.96 695.03 <NA> laughter a gigantic helmet <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 694.99 704.97 <NA> so with more space you have more time and this is a bit of a joke but some of you may have seen this this is bubble soccer and it 's a real sport in fact i saw some young adults
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 705.1 712.89 <NA> playing this sport down the street from my house the other day and as far as i know there have been no reported concussions but
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 713.66 721.17 <NA> in all seriousness this principle does work but this has gone too far this isn 't something that 's practical for bike riding or
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 721.17 729.97 <NA> playing football <unk> and so we are collaborating with a company in sweden called hvding some of you may have seen their work
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 730.07 734.49 <NA> <unk> and they 're using the same principle of of air to give you some extra space
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 734.33 739.72 <NA> to prevent concussion <unk> kids don 't try this at home please 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 740.22 743.29 <NA> this stuntman does not have a helmet 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 743.76 750.02 <NA> he instead has a neck collar <unk> and this neck collar has sensors in it the
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 753.1 759.39 <NA> <unk> it detects when he 's likely to have a fall and there 's an airbag that explodes and triggers the same way that
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 759.18 761.87 <NA> an airbag works in your car essentially and
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 761.53 770.72 <NA> in the experiments we 've done in my lab with their device we found that it can greatly reduce the risk of concussion in some scenarios compared to a normal bicycle helmet <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 770.72 773.12 <NA> so it 's a pretty exciting development <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 773.29 775.58 <NA> but in order for
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 775.15 779.67 <NA> us to actually realize the benefits of technology that can prevent concussion
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 779.87 783.3 <NA> it needs to meet regulations 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 782.84 791.65 <NA> that 's a reality <unk> and this device is for sale in europe but is not for sale in the us and probably won 't be any time soon so
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 791.65 796.89 <NA> i wanted to tell you why there are some good reasons and then there are some not so good reasons 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 796.79 800.86 <NA> bike helmets are federally regulated <unk> the consumer
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 800.7 804.79 <NA> product safety commission has been given jurisdiction to approve any bike helmet for sale
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 805.11 810.67 <NA> <unk> and this is the test they use this is back to what i was telling you at the beginning about skull fracture that 's what this test is for 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 810.67 819.1 <NA> and that 's an important thing to do it can save your life but it 's not sufficient i would say so for example one thing this test doesn 't evaluate
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 818.67 824.69 <NA> is it doesn 't tell you is that airbag going to trigger at the right time and place and not trigger when it doesn 't need to
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 826.72 831.15 <NA> <unk> it 's not going to tell you is this helmet likely to prevent concussion or not 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 830.91 835.02 <NA> and if you look at football helmets which aren 't regulated 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 835.02 846.36 <NA> they still have a very similar test they 're not regulated by the government anyway they have an industry body which is the way most industries work <unk> but this industry body i can tell you has been quite resistant to updating their standards <unk> 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 846.13 850.02 <NA> so in my lab we are working on not only the mechanism of concussion
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 850.13 864.09 <NA> <unk> but we want to understand how can we have better test standards <unk> and we hope that the government can use this type of information to encourage innovation by letting consumers know how protected are you
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 863.6 869.7 <NA> with a given helmet <unk> and i want to bring this back finally to the original question i asked which is 
DavidCamarillo_2016X 1 DavidCamarillo_2016X 869.69 874.45 <NA> would i feel comfortable letting my child play football or ride a bicycle <unk>
