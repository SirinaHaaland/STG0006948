KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 354.84 358.1 <NA> <unk> relationships and because they do that

KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 368 369.97 <NA> they 're not affronted
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 369.78 372.4 <NA> by differences <unk> 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 375.18 379.97 <NA> they 're fascinated by them and that is a huge shift in mindset
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 380.19 387.08 <NA> <unk> and once you feel it you want it to happen a lot more this world is calling out for us to have a collective
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 386.68 395.09 <NA> mindset <unk> and i believe in doing that it 's especially important now why is it important now <unk> 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 395.59 400.31 <NA> because things can be devised like drones
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 400.51 404.91 <NA> and drugs and data collection and they can
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 404.96 410.42 <NA> <unk> devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 410.2 415.21 <NA> and then as we know from the news every day they can be used for dangerous ones 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 415.21 420.27 <NA> it calls on us each of us to a higher calling 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 420.95 429.94 <NA> but here 's the icing on the cake it 's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that 's probably your greatest
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 429.9 432.46 <NA> <unk> as an institution or an individual it
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 432.57 436.75 <NA> 's after you 've had that experience and you trust each other 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 436.75 445.15 <NA> it 's the unexpected things that you devise later on you never could have predicted for example <unk> marty
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 445.02 452.54 <NA> is the husband of that actress i mentioned <unk> and he watched them when they were practicing and he was soon talking to wally my friend
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 454.84 464.18 <NA> <unk> exercise regime <unk> and he thought i have a set of racquetball courts that guy could teach it a lot of people who work there are members at my courts
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 464.14 470.06 <NA> <unk> they 're frequent travelers they could practice in their hotel room no equipment provided 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 469.93 474.96 <NA> that 's how wally got hired not only that years later he was also teaching
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 476.84 485.76 <NA> <unk> years after that he was teaching the racquetball teachers what i 'm suggesting is when you connect with people
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 485.75 489.48 <NA> around a shared interest and action 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 489.2 496.49 <NA> you 're accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future <unk> and i think that 's what we 're looking at 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 496.49 503.23 <NA> we open ourselves up to those opportunities <unk> and in this room are key players in technology 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 503.05 504.67 <NA> key players who are uniquely

KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 510.06 514.78 <NA> so here 's what i 'm calling for you to do remember the three traits of <unk>
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 517.88 520.6 <NA> keep honing their top strength
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 520.71 529.97 <NA> and they become pattern seekers <unk> they get involved in different worlds than their worlds so they 're trusted and they
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 529.9 538.77 <NA> <unk> can see those patterns <unk> and they communicate to connect around sweet spots of shared interest so what i 'm asking you
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 538.77 546.63 <NA> is the world is hungry i truly believe in my firsthand experience the world is hungry for us
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 546.42 548.06 <NA> to unite together as <unk>
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 549.3 554.4 <NA> and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do i know that firsthand
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 555.62 565.62 <NA> and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own 
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 566.42 573.93 <NA> just remember <unk> as dave liniger once said you can 't succeed
KareAnderson_2014S 1 KareAnderson_2014S 573.92 577.09 <NA> coming to the potluck with only a fork
