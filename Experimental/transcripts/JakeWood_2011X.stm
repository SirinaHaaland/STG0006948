JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 35.48 39.9 <NA> military veterans are very very good at disaster response 
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 39.74 45.81 <NA> and coming home my cofounder and i we looked at it and we said there are two problems 
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 45.95 50.02 <NA> the first problem is there 's inadequate disaster response it 's slow it 's
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 50.91 56.86 <NA> <unk> 's not using the best technology and it 's not using the best people the second problem that we became aware of
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 56.69 66.4 <NA> was a very inadequate veteran reintegration and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from iraq and afghanistan <unk> and they 're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life <unk> 
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 66.12 74.56 <NA> and we sat here and we looked at these two problems and finally we came to a realization these aren 't problems these are actually solutions <unk> and what do i mean by that well 
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 74.49 79.34 <NA> we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 79.78 86.33 <NA> <unk> recent surveys show that ninety two percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform and we can use veterans

JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 88.24 100.28 <NA> now on the surface this makes a lot of sense and in two thousand and ten we responded to the tsunami in in chile <unk> the floods in pakistan we sent training teams to the thai burma border <unk> but it was earlier this year <unk> 
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 100.06 102.95 <NA> when one of our original members
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 102.97 104.88 <NA> caused us to shift focus in the

JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 121.24 129.94 <NA> to refocus what it is that we were doing you know <unk> clay didn 't kill himself because of what happened in iraq and afghanistan clay killed himself

JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 132.78 140.35 <NA> he lost purpose <unk> he lost his community and perhaps most tragically <unk> he lost his self worth 
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 140.94 149.35 <NA> and so as we evaluated and as the dust settled from this tragedy <unk> we realized that of those two problems
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 148.95 154.94 <NA> in the initial iteration of our organization <unk> we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran

JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 163.75 171.2 <NA> and suddenly now moving forward we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that 's using disaster response 
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 171.4 173.7 <NA> because we think that we can give
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 173.54 175.14 <NA> that purpose and that community
JakeWood_2011X 1 JakeWood_2011X 175.91 185.94 <NA> <unk> back to the veteran and tornadoes in tuscaloosa and joplin and then later hurricane irene gave us an opportunity to look at that now i want you to imagine for a second
