TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 17.38 29.97 <NA> <unk> many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent make us smarter and more connected to the world <unk> and what i 'd like to argue is that that 's not necessarily the case as progress is simply a word for change
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 30.07 39.93 <NA> and with change you gain something <unk> but you also lose something and to really illustrate this point what i 'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 39.44 45.6 <NA> a very simple a very common an everyday question and that question is this 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 46.19 50.02 <NA> what time is it <unk> what time is it <unk> if you glance at your iphone 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 50 55.48 <NA> <unk> it 's so simple to tell the time <unk> but i 'd like to ask you how would you tell the time if you didn 't have an iphone <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 55.48 60.82 <NA> how would you tell the time say <unk> six hundred years ago <unk> how would you do it <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 60.36 64.76 <NA> well <unk> the way you would do it is by using a device
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 64.37 66.94 <NA> that 's called an astrolabe <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 67.53 78.53 <NA> so <unk> an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today 's world but at the time in the 13th century it was the gadget of the day it was the world 's first
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 78.35 79.61 <NA> popular computer
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 79.93 83.45 <NA> <unk> was a device that in fact is a model of the sky <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 83.23 95.72 <NA> so the different parts of the astrolabe in this particular type the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars the plate corresponds to a coordinate system <unk> and the mater has some scales and puts it all together <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 95.32 99.99 <NA> if you were an educated child you would know how to not only use the
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 100.76 114.85 <NA> <unk> you would also know how to make an astrolabe <unk> and we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe the first technical manual in the english language was written by geoffrey chaucer <unk> yes that geoffrey chaucer in one thousand three hundred and ninety one to his little lewis
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 116.36 118.11 <NA> and in this
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 117.62 119.97 <NA> book little lewis would
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 119.97 129.58 <NA> would know the big idea and the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection <unk> and basically the concept is how do you
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 129.96 137.43 <NA> <unk> represent the three dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat portable two dimensional surface <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 137.27 145.36 <NA> the idea is actually relatively simple <unk> imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 145.36 154.64 <NA> each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole onto a flat surface where it is then recorded <unk> so the north star corresponds to the
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 154.78 160.97 <NA> <unk> center of the device <unk> the ecliptic which is the path of the sun moon and planets correspond to an offset circle 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 160.8 171.5 <NA> the bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete <unk> and the altitude corresponds to the plate system now the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection <unk>
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 171.45 179.97 <NA> the real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly there is the position of the sun moon and planets on the movable rete
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 180.16 189.18 <NA> <unk> and then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate okay <unk> so how would you use this
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 189.38 199.09 <NA> this device <unk> well <unk> let me first back up for a moment <unk> this is an astrolabe
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 205.02 209.95 <NA> <unk> on loan from us from the oxford school of museum of history <unk> and
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 209.85 214.39 <NA> you can see the different components this is the mater the scales on the back 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 214.39 221.63 <NA> this is the rete <unk> okay do you see that that 's the movable part of the of the sky <unk> and in the back you can see
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 221.45 225.05 <NA> a spider web pattern and that spider web pattern corresponds to
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 225.04 226.82 <NA> <unk> the local coordinates in the sky <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 226.82 236.09 <NA> this is a rule device and on the back are some other devices measuring tools and scales to be able to make some calculations okay you
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 237.85 240.23 <NA> i 've always wanted one of these
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 240.13 247.58 <NA> for my thesis i actually built one of these out of paper <unk> and this one this is a a replica from <unk>
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 248.55 249.93 <NA> device <unk> and
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 250.31 256.8 <NA> <unk> it 's worth probably about three macbook pros <unk> but a real one would cost about as much as my house
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 256.34 265.12 <NA> <unk> and the house next to it and actually every house on the block on both sides of the street maybe a school thrown in and some you know a church they are just incredibly expensive <unk>
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 265.12 267.61 <NA> but let me show you how to work this device <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 267.37 270 <NA> so let 's go to step one 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 269.84 275.08 <NA> first thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky if you 're telling time at night so
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 275.7 285.4 <NA> <unk> if it 's clear you 'll be able to see the summer triangle and there is a bright star called deneb <unk> so let 's select deneb <unk> second is you measure the altitude of deneb so step two 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 284.97 288.25 <NA> i hold the device up <unk> and then i sight
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 288.51 292.45 <NA> its altitude there so i can see it clearly now <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 292.17 302.27 <NA> and then i measure its altitude so it 's about <unk> twenty six degrees you can 't see it from over there step three is identify the star on the front
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 302.08 304.46 <NA> of the device deneb is there i can tell
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 304.84 314.75 <NA> <unk> step four is i then move the rete move the sky <unk> so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back okay
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 314.75 317.18 <NA> <unk> so when that happens
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 316.87 325.11 <NA> everything lines up i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky <unk> okay <unk> so <unk> it
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 325.67 331.44 <NA> <unk> in a sense holding a model of the universe in my hands <unk> and then finally i take a rule 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 331.7 339.36 <NA> and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here right so <unk> that 's how the device is used 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 341.06 350.02 <NA> so i know what you 're thinking that 's a lot of work isn 't it <unk> isn 't it a ton of work to be able to to tell the time as you glance at your ipod to just check out
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 350.64 354.88 <NA> <unk> but there is a difference between the two because with your ipod you can tell
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 354.45 357.16 <NA> or your iphone you can tell exactly what the
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 356.73 367.3 <NA> time is with precision <unk> the way little lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky <unk> he would know where things would fit in the sky he would not only know
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 366.99 375.05 <NA> what time it was he would also know where the sun would rise <unk> and how it would move across the sky <unk> he would know what time the sun
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 375.7 384.41 <NA> <unk> and what time it would set and he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens <unk> so <unk> in computer graphics and computer
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 384.55 388.98 <NA> user interface design there is a term called affordances 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 388.98 400.08 <NA> so affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it <unk> and what the astrolabe does is it allows us it affords us to connect to the night sky <unk> to
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 400 402.21 <NA> <unk> look up into the night sky and be much more
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 402.26 406.17 <NA> to see the visible and the invisible together <unk> 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 406.16 408.78 <NA> so <unk> that 's just one use
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 408.53 410.15 <NA> <unk> incredible 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 409.99 420.9 <NA> there is probably three hundred and fifty four hundred uses in fact there is a text and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer on the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation <unk>
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 420.85 429.97 <NA> you can survey with it the city of baghdad was surveyed with it it can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types and it would take a full university
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 429.99 439.15 <NA> <unk> course to illustrate it <unk> astrolabes have an incredible history they are over two thousand years old the concept of stereographic projection originated in three <unk>
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 440.33 450.26 <NA> and the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms there is portable ones there is large display ones and i think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 450.22 456.95 <NA> <unk> works of art there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 456.46 466.85 <NA> astrolabes like every technology do evolve over time <unk> so the earliest retes for example were very simple and and primitive <unk> and advancing retes became cultural emblems this <unk>
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 466.75 478.26 <NA> <unk> is one from oxford <unk> and i find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical <unk> and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical or random sky <unk> how cool is that
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 479.99 489.82 <NA> <unk> lewis have an astrolabe <unk> probably not one made of brass he would have one made out of wood or paper and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 489.64 493.05 <NA> device that you could keep in the back back of your pocket 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 493.04 500.44 <NA> so what does the astrolabe inspire <unk> well i think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 502.11 506.38 <NA> <unk> our forebears were years and years ago it 's just an incredible device
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 506.94 516.76 <NA> every technology advances every technology is transformed and moved by by others and what we gain with a new technology of course is precision and accuracy <unk> but what <unk>
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 516.66 523.9 <NA> <unk> we lose i think is an accurate a felt sense of the sky a sense of of context 
TomWujec_2009G 1 TomWujec_2009G 525.16 533.43 <NA> <unk> knowing your relationship with the sky <unk> is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it
