RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 29.93 32.31 <NA> small group of us got together
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 32.51 36.72 <NA> to have a a go a run at the whole challenge of flight that inspired
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 36.72 45.61 <NA> inspired people for years <unk> and do it in a very different kind of way <unk> and that 's the journey i 'd like to share with you now the starting hypothesis was one of
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 45.41 50.02 <NA> the human mind and body which as you 've seen for the last few days here is an amazing
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 51.21 54.46 <NA> <unk> what if you augmented that wonderful machine
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 54.3 61.99 <NA> with just the right technology <unk> if you approach flight in that kind of real way where could you get to so my training partner here
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 61.53 65.77 <NA> back in london denton is doing a much better job of that kind of stuff than than me
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 65.64 73.87 <NA> <unk> guess what it 's london <unk> the idea was that you augment that and so how do you augment that well <unk> we bought one of these
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 78.22 84.89 <NA> <unk> this was ground zero so that little piece of kit proved really quite impressive <unk> so we got two in a field 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 86.17 91.31 <NA> the real hero here by the way is right in the background there 's a lady tending some vegetables 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 91.09 94.49 <NA> who does a brilliant job of trying to ignore us for a while 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 97.27 99.99 <NA> i think the only thing less happy is the grass
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 100.01 101.19 <NA> <unk> that we did
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 100.73 108.33 <NA> probably damage quite badly you get an idea of the thrust here when i try to hold them horizontally and somewhat fail <unk> that 's around fifty kilos of thrust there 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 109.07 115.47 <NA> we were quite impressed with that we thought we were getting somewhere so there <unk> there 's only one sensible way to go from there 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 115.7 117.39 <NA> you get four 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 122.24 129.67 <NA> i have to say i still like watching these back so then we thought well <unk> let 's try and spread the load a bit the legs are designed to take the load so
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 129.99 136.09 <NA> <unk> don 't we spread it out a bit that bit was good the harness
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 135.72 142.9 <NA> a nice idea but it didn 't really work <unk> as you 'll see now <unk> this whole journey was very much about trying things 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 143.16 150.79 <NA> yeah it really didn 't work did it trying things and learning by failing at them most of the time <unk> and
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 150.3 152.2 <NA> that included
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 151.98 153.62 <NA> failing by falling over
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 155.01 160.94 <NA> <unk> if you notice we 've got five engines here not to be put off by the fact one was in maintenance still had a go <unk> and
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 160.9 165.14 <NA> then i pinched a fuel line so again good learning we learned not to do that again <unk> 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 166.54 175.14 <NA> this was a blind alley this was three on each arm that was ridiculous that was seventy kilos on each arm again <unk> struck
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 178.13 179.69 <NA> <unk> we were starting to make some really
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 179.47 189.08 <NA> quite convincing progress just enough to make you believe that maybe maybe we could get there you can see look tantalizing the model of
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 189.08 198.61 <NA> one on each leg and two on each arm on paper that was enough thrust and then then we did what i 'm about to show you now and i still love watching this one
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 211.86 214.99 <NA> <unk> that was the point where this this endeavor went from 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 214.5 222.16 <NA> i 'm really not sure this is going to work to oh my god it does work from there on we then refined it but we carried on falling over a lot 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 222.51 224.9 <NA> falling over like i say is definitely the best way to learn
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 226.96 234.08 <NA> <unk> after a while we starting really refining the layout of all of this and you 'll see that 's stability and control there 's no wires there or anything that 's
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 233.59 239.48 <NA> a combination of us refining the technology including with a tupperware box on the back for the electronics
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 239.23 243.68 <NA> and and actually learning the balance and control i
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 243.49 249.17 <NA> 'm now going to save your ears for the next short piece and talk over it after a while the jet engine noise is a bit annoying
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 250.04 251.61 <NA> <unk> this is only a few weeks ago <unk> 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 251.12 258.01 <NA> you can see the stability and control is really quite nice <unk> and i 'd like to think this somewhat validates that starting hypothesis 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 258.01 261.87 <NA> that the human mind and body <unk> if properly
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 261.44 269.1 <NA> augmented in that way can achieve some pretty cool stuff i mean like <unk> i said i 'm not thinking about where i 'm moving my arms at that stage 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 268.76 274.08 <NA> i 'm looking at the objective of where i want to get to and a bit like riding a bike 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 273.77 277.65 <NA> my arms are just doing their thing it 's a very strange experience <unk> 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 277.55 279.07 <NA> so where is all this headed
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 279.81 282.52 <NA> <unk> over this landing i think i land in this one 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 283.05 288.88 <NA> well <unk> i don 't think anybody 's going to go down to walmart or take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while <unk> 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 288.75 295.75 <NA> but the team at gravity are building some awesome technology that 's going to make this look like child 's play <unk> we 're working on some things that will
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 295.75 300.89 <NA> seek to bring this unusual experience of flight to a wider audience beyond the events and displays we 're doing
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 300.67 303.74 <NA> we 're even starting to look for pilots two and three if there 's any volunteers
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 305.25 306.44 <NA> i 've got this vision 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 306.44 316.46 <NA> it sounds audacious but let 's just stick it out there that one day maybe we can rise up above a beach fly up and down the coastline of it rise up a bit higher with some of the safety kit we 're working on to make this achievable
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 316.39 325.55 <NA> then over the horizon comes a hercules with the ramp down <unk> as it comes past you start picking up speed and see if we can intercept from the rear not the front that would be a mistake
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 325.15 327.24 <NA> and then try and land in the back
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 330.53 332.1 <NA> <unk> but
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 331.93 337.68 <NA> this this is also <unk> if i take a big step back from this this is also a very personal journey for me
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 337.82 344.71 <NA> <unk> back to that lovely photo or photo in a picture <unk> sadly my father
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 344.52 347.7 <NA> took his own life when i was fifteen and left an awful lot of
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 347.27 349.99 <NA> unfulfilled ambition <unk> he was a wonderful
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 355.11 357.37 <NA> <unk> if he was looking down <unk> he would be
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 357.21 363.4 <NA> he 'd certainly be smiling at some of the things we 've done here i think so it 's a tribute to him <unk> thank you very much richard browning 
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 367.53 370.54 <NA> i 'm probably more nervous about doing the demo after this <unk>
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 372.57 379.88 <NA> <unk> got a lot of things to get done today <unk> worst case scenario we don 't get a clean start or we get an unplanned failure while i 'm actually flying around this is why we keep it very low
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 379.96 384.81 <NA> <unk> the worst is i just look like an idiot and fall on my rear as i said <unk> so you can all enjoy
RichardBrowning_2017 1 RichardBrowning_2017 407.96 410.11 <NA> <unk> day
