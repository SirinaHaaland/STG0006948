DavidCameron_2010 1 DavidCameron_2010 79.93 82.04 <NA> <unk> i think what this leads to
DavidCameron_2010 1 DavidCameron_2010 81.64 88.88 <NA> is a very simple recognition that there 's one question in politics at the moment above all other and it 's this one 
DavidCameron_2010 1 DavidCameron_2010 88.88 92.72 <NA> how do we make things better without spending more money <unk> 
DavidCameron_2010 1 DavidCameron_2010 92.26 102.56 <NA> because there isn 't going to be a lot of money to improve public services or to improve government or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about
