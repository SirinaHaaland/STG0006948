RoseGoslinga_2014S 1 RoseGoslinga_2014S 122.99 128.98 <NA> my minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly i am going to pray for rain
RoseGoslinga_2014S 1 RoseGoslinga_2014S 131.34 133.63 <NA> that ended the discussion 
RoseGoslinga_2014S 1 RoseGoslinga_2014S 134.82 139.12 <NA> on the way back to the ministry in the car she turned around to me and said

RoseGoslinga_2014S 1 RoseGoslinga_2014S 144.21 154.43 <NA> it 's been six years since <unk> and last year i was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over one hundred and eighty five thousand farmers in kenya and rwanda against
