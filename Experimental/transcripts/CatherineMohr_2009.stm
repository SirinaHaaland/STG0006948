CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 419.99 425.56 <NA> the question had to be asked well can we do these same surgeries
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 425.4 426.94 <NA> but through little incisions
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 430.07 436 <NA> is doing this kind of surgery <unk> surgery with long instruments through small incisions <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 435.87 439.72 <NA> and it really changed the landscape of surgery <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 439.23 453.2 <NA> some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that that allowed this to be done for real operations
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 454.96 464.15 <NA> <unk> so what you see this is now the first surgical image as we 're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body it looks very different from what you 're expecting surgery to look like 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 464.11 470.69 <NA> we bring instruments in from two separate cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue <unk>

CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 484 486.84 <NA> pretty big revolution <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 487.73 490.92 <NA> but there were casualties of this revolution 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 491.48 500.65 <NA> these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 500.47 503.68 <NA> quite a bit higher surgeons had to give up their
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 504.99 509.26 <NA> <unk> to give up their wrists they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 510.87 512.8 <NA> this surgeon
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 512.37 520.42 <NA> has over three thousand hours of laparoscopic experience now this is a particularly frustrating
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 520.29 529.97 <NA> placement of the needle but this is hard and one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 530.16 538.97 <NA> are terrible you 've got these long instruments and you 're working off your centerline and the instruments are essentially working backwards <unk>
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 539.41 548.78 <NA> so what you need to do to take the capability of your hand <unk> and put it on the other side of that small incision is you need to put a wrist
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 548.41 554.94 <NA> on that instrument <unk> and so i get to talk about robots the da vinci robot
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 554.95 557.73 <NA> put just that wrist on the other side of that
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 557.53 561.81 <NA> incision <unk> and so here you 're seeing the operation of this wrist 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 561.77 568.47 <NA> and now in contrast to the laparoscopy you can precisely place the needle in your instruments 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 568.19 573 <NA> and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 572.96 577.05 <NA> and the reason why this becomes so much easier is you can see
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 576.98 579.97 <NA> on the bottom the hands are
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 580.02 586.99 <NA> <unk> making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 586.59 594.49 <NA> those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot the surgeon is sitting at a console and
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 594.33 603.8 <NA> controlling the robot with these controllers and the robot is moving these instruments around and powering them down inside the body <unk> you have a
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 604.96 609.74 <NA> <unk> get a 3d view <unk> and since this was introduced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 610.03 616.34 <NA> a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 616.09 621.21 <NA> which is a prostate deep in the pelvis <unk> and it requires fine dissection
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 621.03 622.07 <NA> and
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 621.64 624.96 <NA> delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 626.36 631.17 <NA> <unk> you can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 631.22 636.1 <NA> without cracking the chest this is all done in between the ribs <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 636.1 642.27 <NA> and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 642.95 645.42 <NA> you 've got these technologies thank you 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 648.65 654.01 <NA> and so you might say wow this is really cool so smartypants why isn 't all surgery being done this way
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 654.78 659.2 <NA> <unk> and there are some reasons some good reasons and cost is one of them 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 658.77 666.97 <NA> i talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 666.87 671.33 <NA> more useful than a solid gold surgeon but still it 's a fairly
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 671.17 674.96 <NA> big capital investment but once you 've got it
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 675.94 678.38 <NA> <unk> your procedure costs do come down 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 678.91 681.59 <NA> but there are other barriers <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 681.13 691.34 <NA> so something like a prostatectomy the prostate is small and it 's in one spot <unk> and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 690.91 700.17 <NA> and so it 's perfect for something like that and in fact if you or anyone you know had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years chances are it was done with one of these systems
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 701.48 711.57 <NA> <unk> but if you need to reach more places than just one you need to move the robot <unk> and you need to put some new incisions in there <unk> and you need to re set it up 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 711.26 715.41 <NA> and then you need to add some more ports and more 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 715.76 717.45 <NA> and the problem is it gets <unk>
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 718.42 724.71 <NA> and cumbersome <unk> and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren 't being done with the da vinci 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 725.12 728.53 <NA> so we had to ask the question well how do we fix that
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 730.59 740.56 <NA> <unk> what if we could change it so that we didn 't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 740.13 744.07 <NA> how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 743.91 747.37 <NA> and how would that change the experience for the patient now
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 748.08 752.9 <NA> to do that we need to be able to bring a camera
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 752.66 754.97 <NA> and instruments in together
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 755.08 764.06 <NA> <unk> through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video <unk> or not so coincidentally like a tube like this 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 765.61 774.42 <NA> so what 's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 780.35 783.48 <NA> <unk> this is the camera and three instruments 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 783.14 790.38 <NA> and as you see it come out in order to actually be able to do anything useful it can 't all stay clustered up like this 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 790.01 793.72 <NA> it has to be able to come off of the centerline
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 793.49 803.32 <NA> and then be able to work back toward that centerline he 's a cheeky little devil <unk> but what this lets you do is gives you that
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 804.86 814.78 <NA> counter traction so that you can dissect <unk> so that you can sew so that you can do all the things that you need to do all the surgical tasks <unk> but it 's all coming in through one incision it 's
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 815.67 824.81 <NA> not so simple <unk> but it 's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we 're going around for the

CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 845.86 854.43 <NA> go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 854.99 858.64 <NA> <unk> need to not just take our hands in in new ways <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 858.64 866.4 <NA> we also need to take our eyes in in new ways <unk> we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we 're cutting

CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 871.73 879.97 <NA> this is a cancer surgery <unk> one of the problems with this even for surgeons who 've been looking at this a lot is you can 't see the cancer

CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 886.28 893.26 <NA> is we 're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer it
CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 893.28 900.11 <NA> will go bind to the cancer <unk> and we can make those markers glow <unk> and we can take special

CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 923.23 929.94 <NA> we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass

CatherineMohr_2009 1 CatherineMohr_2009 969.03 971.75 <NA> and we can look at cells directly
