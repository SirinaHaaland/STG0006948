WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 170.33 179.82 <NA> because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe he wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous he wanted to make that which was expensive
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 179.96 188.02 <NA> <unk> free <unk> and he wanted to do this as a matter of principle <unk> because not many people are really going to read archimedes

WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 201.26 204.82 <NA> wouldn 't be as much as you think because these people they didn 't come from money
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 204.96 212.23 <NA> <unk> they came from archimedes and they came from all sorts of different backgrounds they came from particle physics they came from classical philology <unk>

WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 226.18 231.65 <NA> <unk> first problem was a conservation problem and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 231.16 233.92 <NA> there was glue on the spine of the book <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 233.92 243.35 <NA> and if you look at this photograph carefully the bottom half of this is rather brown and that glue is hide glue now if you 're a conservator you can take off this glue reasonably easily <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 242.92 246.26 <NA> the top half is elmer 's wood glue it

WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 255.35 259.01 <NA> start imaging archimedes we had to take this book apart <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 259.01 265.41 <NA> so it took four years to take apart <unk> and this is a rare action shot ladies and gentlemen 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 268.16 279.88 <NA> another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax because this was used in the liturgical services of the greek orthodox church and they 'd used candle wax and the candle wax was dirty and we couldn 't image through the
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 279.81 288.97 <NA> <unk> wax <unk> so very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax <unk> it 's hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is but
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 288.8 296.8 <NA> it came out in little bits very often and normally in a book you wouldn 't worry about the little bits but these little bits might contain unique archimedes text 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 296.79 301.04 <NA> so tiny fragments we actually managed to put back
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 300.81 302.33 <NA> in the right place
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 305.14 311.13 <NA> <unk> then having done that we started to image the manuscript and we imaged the manuscript in fourteen different wavebands of light <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 311.13 320.63 <NA> because if you look at something in different wavebands of light you see different things and here is an image of a page imaged in fourteen different wavebands of light <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 320.59 323.66 <NA> but none of them worked <unk> so
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 323.23 329.97 <NA> what we did was we processed the images together <unk> and we put two images into one blank screen
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 330.02 333.45 <NA> <unk> here are two different images of the archimedes manuscript 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 333.02 341.79 <NA> and the image on the left is the normal red image and the image on the right is an ultraviolet image and in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the archimedes writing 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 341.39 349.17 <NA> if you merge them together into one digital canvas the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 349.01 354.88 <NA> the prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark the archimedes text is
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 354.81 364.12 <NA> <unk> dark in one image and bright in another <unk> and it 'll come out dark but red <unk> and then you can start to read it rather clearly <unk> and that 's what it looks like 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 365.49 372.5 <NA> now that 's a before and after image but you don 't read the image on the screen like that you zoom in
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 372.5 374.17 <NA> and you zoom in
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 373.71 375.61 <NA> and you zoom in
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 375.42 377.72 <NA> and you zoom in and you can just
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 385.54 393.68 <NA> if you process the same two images in a different way you can actually get rid of the prayer book text and this is terribly important because
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 393.34 400.11 <NA> the diagrams in the in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 401.84 403.86 <NA> <unk> i can give them to you 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 404.93 414.15 <NA> with this kind of imaging this kind of infrared ultraviolet invisible light imaging we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries how were we going to do that well
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 413.66 420.27 <NA> we took the manuscript and we decided to image it in x ray fluorescence imaging 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 419.84 429.91 <NA> so an x ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom and that electron disappears <unk> and as it disappears
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 429.92 434.98 <NA> an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 434.52 440.3 <NA> and when it takes its place it sheds electromagnetic radiation it sheds an x ray 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 440.3 445.45 <NA> and this x ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 445.41 450.08 <NA> and what we wanted to get was the iron <unk> because the ink was written in
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 450.73 460.1 <NA> <unk> and if we can map where this x ray that comes out where it comes from we can map all the iron on the page then theoretically we can read the image 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 460.45 467.55 <NA> the thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this so we took it to the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 467.16 475.19 <NA> in california which is a particle accelerator electrons go around one way <unk> positrons go around the other they meet in the middle <unk>

WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 479.93 483.57 <NA> <unk> now we weren 't actually going to put archimedes in that beam <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 483.14 490.27 <NA> but as the electrons go round at the speed of light they shed x rays and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 490.27 498.24 <NA> this is called synchrotron radiation and it 's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing but we wanted it to look at atoms 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 498.08 504.94 <NA> at iron atoms <unk> so that we could read the page from before and after and lo and behold we found that we could do it
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 504.99 508 <NA> <unk> took about seventeen minutes to do a single page <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 508.71 515.03 <NA> so what did we discover <unk> well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called the stomachion 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 514.82 519.98 <NA> and this didn 't exist in codices a and b and we knew that it involved this square <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 519.98 528.61 <NA> and this is a perfect square and it 's divided into fourteen bits <unk> but no one knew what archimedes was doing with these fourteen bits and now we think we know <unk> 
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 528.63 529.97 <NA> he was trying to work
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 529.96 536.96 <NA> <unk> out how many ways you can recombine those fourteen bits and still make a perfect square <unk> anyone want to guess the answer
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 538.06 546.26 <NA> it 's seventeen <unk> thousand one hundred and fifty two divided into five hundred and thirty six families <unk> and the important point about this
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 546.26 553.68 <NA> is that it 's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics and combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 554.87 562.01 <NA> <unk> astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made the scribe had made
WilliamNoel_2012S 1 WilliamNoel_2012S 561.79 567.54 <NA> his book out of and one of them was a manuscript containing text by hyperides <unk> now hyperides
