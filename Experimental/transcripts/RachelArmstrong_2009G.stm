RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 50.13 53.59 <NA> <unk> in order to do this we need the right kind of language

RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 151.45 160.13 <NA> <unk> this is a protocell and it 's vigorously shedding this skin now this looks like a chemical kind of birth <unk> this is a violent process 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 160 169.45 <NA> here we 've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate <unk> and that 's the shell around that globular fat they are
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 169.45 174.96 <NA> quite brittle so you 've only got a part of one there so what we 're trying to do is we 're trying to push these technologies
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 176.48 184.71 <NA> <unk> construction approaches for architecture which contrast the current victorian top down methods which impose structure upon matter

RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 187.37 193.29 <NA> so bottom up materials actually exist today <unk> they 've been in use
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 193.28 200.05 <NA> <unk> in architecture since ancient times if you walk around the city of oxford where we are today <unk> and have a look at the brickwork which
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 200.04 214.4 <NA> <unk> i 've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days you 'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone <unk> and if you look even closer you 'll see in that limestone there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other and then they are fossilized over millions of years 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 214.4 218.99 <NA> now a block of limestone in itself isn 't particularly that interesting it
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 218.76 220.15 <NA> looks beautiful
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 219.96 229.94 <NA> <unk> but imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 229.98 233.36 <NA> maybe they could extract carbon dioxide 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 233.17 244.94 <NA> would it give this block of limestone new properties well most likely it would it might be able to grow it might be able to self repair and even respond to dramatic changes in the in the immediate environment <unk> 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 244.99 250.02 <NA> so <unk> architects are never happy with just one block of an
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 253.1 265.14 <NA> <unk> when we think about scaling up metabolic materials we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 264.95 274.99 <NA> so one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice <unk> now venice as you know has a tempestuous relationship with the sea and is built upon
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 276.39 283.9 <NA> <unk> so we 've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we 're working with to sustainably reclaim venice <unk> 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 283.86 293.26 <NA> and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 293.19 304.97 <NA> so here is the technology we have today <unk> this is our protocell technology effectively making a shell like its limestone forefathers and depositing it in a very complex environment
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 305.04 310.1 <NA> <unk> against natural materials we 're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 310.1 318.48 <NA> now this is the very interesting part we don 't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals what we need it to do is to be creatively
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 318.31 324.99 <NA> crafted around the wooden piles <unk> so you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 325.73 339.54 <NA> <unk> the dark foundations we 've observed this in the laboratory the protocells can actually move away from the light they can actually also move towards the light you have to just choose your species so that these don 't just exist as one entity <unk> we kind of chemically engineer them and
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 339.44 348.45 <NA> so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically around the foundations of venice effectively petrifying it <unk> 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 348.11 350.26 <NA> now <unk> this isn 't going to happen
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 351.09 363.22 <NA> <unk> 's going to take a while it 's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case by case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of venice <unk> 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 363.22 373.24 <NA> but gradually as the buildings are repaired we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city an accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide <unk> 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 372.9 374.87 <NA> also it will attract the
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 376.3 380.32 <NA> <unk> who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 380.1 388.36 <NA> so this is really interesting now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way <unk> 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 388.37 395.04 <NA> but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere <unk> this is
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 394.68 404.06 <NA> terrestrial chemistry we 've all got it which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for first world countries 
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 403.66 404.97 <NA> so in summary
RachelArmstrong_2009G 1 RachelArmstrong_2009G 405.1 411.67 <NA> i 'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies and building architectures from a
