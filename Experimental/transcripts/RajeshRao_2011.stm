RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 62.47 65.86 <NA> massive versions of these same symbols 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 67.08 71.05 <NA> now let 's ask ourselves what could such artifacts
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 70.83 79.94 <NA> say about us to people four thousand years into the future this is no hypothetical question in fact this is exactly the kind of question we 're faced with
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 79.96 85.61 <NA> <unk> when we try to understand the indus valley civilization which existed four thousand years ago <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 85.12 100.02 <NA> the indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known egyptian and the mesopotamian civilizations but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations <unk> it occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers <unk> covering what is now
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 102.44 114.58 <NA> <unk> and parts of afghanistan and iran given that it was such a vast civilization you might expect to find really powerful rulers kings <unk> and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings <unk> in fact <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 114.58 119.88 <NA> what archeologists have found is none of that they 've found small objects such as these
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 119.72 121.92 <NA> here 's an example
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 121.58 129.97 <NA> of one of these objects well obviously this is a replica <unk> but who is this person a king a god

RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 137.73 141.55 <NA> but the indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them <unk>

RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 150 156.59 <NA> sign board which was found buried near the gate of a city <unk> now we don 't know if it says hollywood or even bollywood for that matter <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 156.37 160.25 <NA> in fact <unk> we don 't even know what any of these objects say 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 160.08 162.98 <NA> and that 's because the indus script is undeciphered <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 162.81 165.08 <NA> we don 't know what any of these symbols mean
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 164.91 173.9 <NA> the symbols are most commonly found on seals so you see up there one such object it 's the square object with the unicorn like animal on it 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 173.9 178.92 <NA> now that 's a magnificent piece of art so how big do you think that is perhaps that big
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 179.96 182.58 <NA> <unk> that big <unk> well let me show you
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 183.86 190.39 <NA> here 's a replica of one such seal <unk> it 's only about one inch by one inch in size
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 190.39 200.02 <NA> pretty tiny <unk> so what were these used for we know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other so you know those
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 200 207.48 <NA> packing slips you get on your fedex boxes these were used to make those kinds of packing slips you might wonder what these
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 207.26 217.06 <NA> objects contain in terms of their text perhaps they 're the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other we don 't know 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 216.81 219.91 <NA> we need to decipher the script to answer that question
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 219.63 229.85 <NA> deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle <unk> it 's actually become a question that 's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 230.05 236.93 <NA> <unk> asia <unk> in fact the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people first <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 236.5 249.99 <NA> there 's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the indus script does not represent a language at all these people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 251.45 258.43 <NA> <unk> there 's a second group of people who believe that the indus script represents an indo european language if you look at a map of india today 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 258.25 268.5 <NA> you 'll see that most of the languages spoken in north india belong to the indo european language family <unk> so some people believe that the indus script represents an ancient indo european language <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 268.4 279.46 <NA> <unk> such as sanskrit <unk> there 's a last group of people who believe that the indus people were the ancestors of people living in south india today <unk> these people believe that the indus script
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 280.11 286.7 <NA> <unk> an ancient form of the dravidian language family <unk> which is the language family spoken in much of south india today <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 286.49 293.18 <NA> and the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of dravidian speaking people in the north actually near afghanistan 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 293.18 304.7 <NA> and they say that perhaps sometime in the past dravidian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indus civilization is perhaps also dravidian
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 304.93 307.38 <NA> <unk> which of these hypotheses can be true <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 307.2 311.22 <NA> we don 't know but perhaps if you deciphered the script you would be able to answer this question <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 311.22 319.14 <NA> but deciphering the script is a very challenging task first there 's no rosetta stone i don 't mean the software i mean an ancient artifact
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 318.69 320.34 <NA> that contains
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 320.34 329.79 <NA> in the same text both a known text and an unknown text we don 't have such an artifact for the indus script <unk> and furthermore we don 't even know what language they spoke
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 329.99 338.01 <NA> <unk> and to make matters even worse most of the text that we have are extremely short so as i showed you they 're usually found on these seals that are very very tiny 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 338.01 342.76 <NA> and so given these formidable obstacles one might wonder and worry
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 342.37 351.87 <NA> whether one will ever be able to decipher the indus script <unk> in the rest of my talk i 'd like to tell you about how i learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the indus script i
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 351.38 354.97 <NA> 've always been fascinated by the indus script ever since i read
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 354.96 357.25 <NA> <unk> about it in a middle school textbook <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 356.91 367.41 <NA> and why was i fascinated well it 's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world <unk> my career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist so in my day job <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 367.41 376.19 <NA> i create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions how the brain makes decisions how the brain learns and so on 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 375.98 379.52 <NA> but in two thousand and seven my path crossed again with the indus script
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 379.87 388.14 <NA> <unk> when i was in india and i had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 387.93 399.27 <NA> and so it was then that i realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists and so i jumped at that opportunity and i 'd like to describe some of the results that we have found or better yet 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 401.98 406.95 <NA> the first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 406.95 415.65 <NA> here are two texts that contain some symbols on them <unk> can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right i
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 415.43 417.45 <NA> 'll give you a couple of seconds
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 418.28 420.73 <NA> okay <unk> right to left how many
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 429.96 440.06 <NA> <unk> notice that there 's a cramping of signs <unk> and it seems like four thousand years ago when the scribe was writing from right to left they ran out of space <unk> and so they had to cram the sign 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 440.01 446.06 <NA> <unk> one of the signs is also below the the text on the top this suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 455.05 457.49 <NA> <unk> other properties of language does the script show
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 457.27 466.89 <NA> languages contain patterns if i give you the letter q and ask you to predict the next letter what do you think that would be most of you said u <unk> which is right <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 466.89 470.01 <NA> now if i asked you to predict one more letter what do you think that would be <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 471.85 479.28 <NA> <unk> could be i it could be a <unk> but certainly not b c or d right <unk> the indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 479.93 490.05 <NA> <unk> lot of text that start with this <unk> diamond shaped symbol <unk> and this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks like symbol <unk> and this is very similar to a q and u example this symbol can in turn be followed by <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 490 499.99 <NA> these fish like symbols and some other signs <unk> but never by these other signs at the bottom <unk> and furthermore <unk> there 's some signs that really prefer the end of texts such as this
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 501.9 506 <NA> <unk> this sign in fact happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 505.79 516.07 <NA> given such patterns here was our idea the idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns <unk> and so we gave the computer the existing texts and the computer learned <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 515.97 524.87 <NA> <unk> a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other <unk> given the computer model we can test the model by
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 526 533.87 <NA> <unk> so we could deliberately erase some symbols and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols here are some examples <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 537.49 543.83 <NA> you may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of wheel of fortune
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 544.3 550.02 <NA> <unk> what we found was that the computer was successful <unk> in seventy five percent of
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 550 556.89 <NA> cases in predicting the correct symbol in the rest of the cases typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 556.69 567.12 <NA> there 's also practical use for this particular procedure <unk> there 's a lot of these texts that are damaged here 's an example of one such text and we can use the computer model now to try to complete <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 567.02 577.9 <NA> <unk> this text and make a best guess prediction here 's an example of a symbol that was predicted <unk> and this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 579.78 584.66 <NA> <unk> model <unk> so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 584.42 587.81 <NA> i think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 587.6 596.17 <NA> such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy this is a physics and information theory term <unk> but just imagine it 's a really random jumble of letters
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 596.17 599.15 <NA> how many of you have ever spilled coffee
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 598.84 599.84 <NA> on a keyboard <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 600.28 612.02 <NA> <unk> you might have encountered the stuck key problem so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there 's no variation at all language on the other hand 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 612.02 617.42 <NA> has an intermediate level of entropy <unk> it 's neither too rigid <unk> nor is it too random 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 616.93 619.19 <NA> what about the indus script
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 618.94 629.97 <NA> here 's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences at the very top you find the uniformly random sequence which is a random jumble of letters and interestingly we also find the dna sequence
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 629.93 640.2 <NA> <unk> from the human genome and instrumental music and both of these are very very flexible which is why you find them in the very high range <unk> at the lower end of the scale you find a rigid sequence a sequence <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 640.1 647.02 <NA> <unk> of all a 's and you also find a computer program in this case in the language fortran which obeys really strict rules 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 654.99 660.37 <NA> <unk> of the linguistic scripts when this result was first published it was highly controversial <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 660.84 674.99 <NA> there were people who raised a hue and cry <unk> and these people were the ones who believed that the indus script does not represent language <unk> i even started to get some hate mail <unk> my students said that i should really seriously consider getting some protection
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 676.21 679.64 <NA> <unk> have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 679.81 682.31 <NA> what does this result really show <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 681.88 686.24 <NA> it shows that the indus script shares an important property of language <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 686.07 688.07 <NA> so as the old saying goes 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 688.07 699.23 <NA> if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands <unk> what other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 698.77 699.84 <NA> well
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 700 709.31 <NA> <unk> linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages so for example here 's the same sentence written in english and the same sentence written in dutch using the same letters of the alphabet
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 709.32 712.3 <NA> if you don 't know dutch and you only know english
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 711.97 719.95 <NA> and i give you some words in dutch you 'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns some things are not right <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 719.95 729.88 <NA> and you 'll say these words are probably not english words the same thing happens in the case of the indus script the computer found several texts two of them are shown here that have
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 730.02 744.88 <NA> <unk> unusual patterns <unk> so for example the first text <unk> there 's a doubling of this <unk> jar shaped sign <unk> this sign is the most frequently occurring sign in the indus script <unk> and it 's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 744.42 754.97 <NA> why is that the case <unk> we went back and looked at where these particular texts were found and it turns out that they were found very very far away from the indus valley they were found in present
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 754.99 758.42 <NA> <unk> day iraq and iran <unk> and why were they found there
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 757.96 771.29 <NA> what i haven 't told you is that the indus people were very very enterprising they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived <unk> and so in this case they were traveling by sea all the way to mesopotamia present day iraq 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 771.29 775.02 <NA> and what seems to have happened here is that the indus traders
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 775.31 785.64 <NA> <unk> the merchants were using this script to write a foreign language it 's just like our english and dutch example and that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 785.54 797.7 <NA> <unk> you see in the text that are found within the indus valley <unk> this suggests that the same script the indus script <unk> could be used to write different languages <unk> the results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 800.97 802.42 <NA> <unk> if it does represent language <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 802.25 813.64 <NA> then how do we read the symbols that 's our next big challenge so you 'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans of insects of fishes of birds
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 813.64 817.69 <NA> most ancient scripts use the rebus principle <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 817.2 825.23 <NA> which is using pictures to represent words <unk> so as an example <unk> here 's a word can you write it using pictures
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 825.55 829.46 <NA> <unk> give you a couple seconds <unk> got it
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 829.15 837.17 <NA> okay great here 's my solution you could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf and that 's belief right 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 836.74 838.71 <NA> there could be other solutions
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 838.47 840.8 <NA> in the case of the indus script <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 840.8 851.12 <NA> the problem is the reverse <unk> you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense <unk> so this is just like a crossword puzzle
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 850.63 854.82 <NA> except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 855.08 863.95 <NA> <unk> are so high if you solve it my colleagues iravatham mahadevan and asko parpola have been making some headway on this particular problem and i 'd like to give you a quick example of
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 863.71 870.56 <NA> parpola 's work here 's a really short text it contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish like sign <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 870.56 875.02 <NA> and i want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 875.04 881.45 <NA> <unk> attached to bundles of goods so it 's quite likely that these tags at least some of them contain names of merchants <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 881.21 891.67 <NA> and it turns out that in india there 's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth <unk> in dravidian <unk>
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 891.57 897.28 <NA> <unk> languages the word for fish is meen which happens to sound just like the word for star <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 900.88 905.6 <NA> <unk> which is the dravidian word for the big dipper star constellation 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 905.35 915.03 <NA> similarly <unk> there 's another sequence of six stars and that translates to aru meen which is the old dravidian name for the star constellation pleiades <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 915.03 919.02 <NA> and finally <unk> there 's other combinations such as this fish sign with
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 918.81 924.99 <NA> something that looks like a roof on top of it and that could be translated into mey meen which is the old dravidian name for
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 928.22 937.23 <NA> <unk> it looks like we 're getting somewhere <unk> but does this prove that these seals contain dravidian names based on planets and star constellations <unk> 
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 937.1 951.63 <NA> well not yet so we have no way of validating these particular readings <unk> but if more and more of these readings start making sense and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct then we know that we are on the right track
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 951.26 954.94 <NA> today <unk> we can write a word such as
RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 955.08 963.26 <NA> ted in egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script <unk> because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century <unk>

RajeshRao_2011 1 RajeshRao_2011 976.83 979.94 <NA> the indus civilization does not belong to just the
