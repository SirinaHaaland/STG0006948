MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 247.92 254.94 <NA> talk with with policymakers it has huge implications even with this whole notion that we have on where
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 255.19 259.33 <NA> when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 259.12 269.46 <NA> and different types of public services which of course as we know are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition right i mean the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in <unk>

MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 351.24 362.81 <NA> <unk> really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department so the pharmaceutical industry which i am personally very interested in because i 've actually had the fortune to study it <unk> in quite some depth 
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 362.57 367.9 <NA> is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non revolutionary bits 
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 367.9 378.65 <NA> because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental <unk> so the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 380.17 388.89 <NA> <unk> variations of existing drugs viagra different color different dosage are the less revolutionary ones <unk> and it turns out that a full seventy five percent
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 388.68 393.98 <NA> of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 393.52 396.86 <NA> <unk> kafka ian public sector labs

MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 406.82 419.43 <NA> quite problematic in fact companies like pfizer and amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on r <unk> & d but that 's a whole different ted talk which one day i 'd be fascinated to tell you about
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 420.43 429.97 <NA> now what 's interesting in all of this is the state in all these examples was doing so much more than just fixing market failures <unk> it was actually shaping
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 430.22 436.17 <NA> and creating markets <unk> it was funding not only the basic research <unk> which again is a typical public good 
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 436.18 441.92 <NA> but even the applied research <unk> it was even god forbid being a venture capitalist so
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 454.69 466.91 <NA> <unk> increasingly important why because as many of us know <unk> v c is actually quite short term they want their returns in three to five years innovation takes a much longer time than that fifteen to twenty years <unk> 
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 466.48 479.7 <NA> and so this whole notion i mean this is the point right <unk> who 's actually funding the hard stuff of course it 's not just the state the private sector does a lot but the narrative that we 've always been told is the state is important for the basics
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 479.96 487.58 <NA> <unk> not really providing that sort of high risk revolutionary thinking out of the box in all these sectors from funding the internet to doing

MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 500.91 512.56 <NA> <unk> and so there 's huge implications of this first of all of course i 'm not someone this old fashioned person market versus state what we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public private partnerships
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 512.56 519.07 <NA> but the point is by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually pffff
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 519.06 525.14 <NA> a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of leviathan i think we 've actually really

MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 534.64 543.62 <NA> with public private partnerships is in terms of de risking what the public sector did in all these examples i just gave you <unk> and there 's many more which
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 543.4 549.84 <NA> myself and other colleagues have been looking at is doing much more than de risking it 's kind of been taking on that risk bring it
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 550.55 552.81 <NA> <unk> actually been the one thinking out of the box
MarianaMazzucato_2013G 1 MarianaMazzucato_2013G 552.59 561.15 <NA> but also i 'm sure you all have had experience with local regional national governments and you 're kind of like you know what that kafka ian bureaucrat i 've met him
