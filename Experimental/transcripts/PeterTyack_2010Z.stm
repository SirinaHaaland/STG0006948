PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 985.58 993.9 <NA> goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision <unk> well biologists
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 993.72 1000.02 <NA> who couldn 't take no for an answer went to the international maritime organization and petitioned them to say can
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1000.76 1011.06 <NA> <unk> those are just lines on the ground can 't you move them over to a place where there 's less of a risk and the international maritime organization responded very strongly these are the new lanes the shipping <unk>
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1010.96 1020.9 <NA> <unk> lanes have been moved <unk> and as you can see the risk of collision is much lower <unk> so it 's very promising actually we can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks

PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1033.34 1041.74 <NA> looked at their competition and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money <unk> they rush as fast as they can to get to their port <unk> but then they often wait there

PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1059.57 1070.25 <NA> so to conclude i 'd just like to point out you know the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment they 've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this <unk> 
PeterTyack_2010Z 1 PeterTyack_2010Z 1070.04 1079.37 <NA> and we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities
