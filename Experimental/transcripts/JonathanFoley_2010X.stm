JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 25 31.77 <NA> we can all relate to and what i 've been calling the other inconvenient truth but first i want to take you on a little journey
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 31.58 36.75 <NA> let 's first visit our planet but at night and from space
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 36.35 42.93 <NA> this is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 42.73 49.83 <NA> and the thing you would notice first of course is how dominant the human presence on our planet is
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 49.83 54.97 <NA> we see cities we see oil fields you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 55.28 61.81 <NA> that we are dominating much of our planet and mostly through the use of energy that we see here at night
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 61.62 66.1 <NA> but let 's go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 65.79 69.85 <NA> what we see during the day is our landscapes
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 69.42 76.9 <NA> this is part of the amazon basin a place called rondonia in the south center part of the brazilian amazon
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 76.53 80 <NA> if you look really carefully in the upper right hand corner you 're going to see
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 79.93 85.25 <NA> <unk> a thin white line which is a road that was built in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 85.09 88.91 <NA> if we come back to the same place in two thousand and one
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 88.68 100.25 <NA> what we 're going to find is that these roads spurt off more roads and more roads after that at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest where there are going to be a few cows
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 100.24 104.91 <NA> these cows are used for beef we 're going to eat these cows and these cows are eaten
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 104.87 109.29 <NA> <unk> basically in south america in brazil and argentina they 're not being shipped up here
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 108.86 116.37 <NA> but this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation is something we notice a lot of around the tropics especially in this part of the world
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 116.18 124.87 <NA> if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world we can go to the bolivian edge of the amazon here also in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 124.87 129.82 <NA> and if you look really carefully there 's a thin white line through that kind of seam
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 129.99 138.64 <NA> <unk> and there 's a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle let 's come back again a few years later here in two thousand and three
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 138.78 147.59 <NA> and we 'll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like iowa than it does like a rainforest in fact what you 're seeing here are soybean fields
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 147.59 150.05 <NA> these soybeans are being shipped to europe and
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 150 160.26 <NA> <unk> to china as animal feed especially after the mad cow disease scare about a decade ago where we don 't want to feed animals animal protein anymore because that can transmit disease
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 160.21 168.24 <NA> <unk> instead we want to feed them more vegetable proteins so soybeans have really exploded showing how trade and globalization are
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 179.87 188.82 <NA> <unk> world is that landscape after landscape after landscape have been cleared and altered for growing food and other crops
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 188.63 198.54 <NA> so one of the questions we 've been asking is how much of the world is used to grow food and where is it exactly and how can we change that into the future and what does it mean
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 198.59 204.82 <NA> well our team has been looking at this on a global scale using satellite data and ground based data kind of to track
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 204.81 207.34 <NA> <unk> farming on a global scale
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 206.94 214.93 <NA> and this is what we found and it 's startling this map shows the presence of agriculture on planet earth
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 214.86 221.53 <NA> the green areas are the areas we use to grow crops like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 221.53 229.76 <NA> that 's sixteen million square kilometers worth of land if you put it all together in one place it 'd be the size of south america
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 230.2 235.64 <NA> the second area in brown is the world 's pastures and rangelands where our animals live
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 235.21 240.36 <NA> that area 's about thirty million square kilometers or about an africa 's worth of land
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 240.12 249.53 <NA> a huge amount of land and it 's the best land of course is what you see and what 's left is like the middle of the sahara desert or siberia or the middle of a rain forest
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 249.53 253.07 <NA> we 're using a planet 's worth of land already
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 252.94 254.91 <NA> if we look at this carefully we find
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 254.96 259.1 <NA> <unk> about forty percent of the earth 's land surface is devoted to agriculture
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 259.11 269.92 <NA> and it 's sixty times larger than all the areas we complain about our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live half of humanity lives in cities today
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 269.71 273.63 <NA> but a sixty times larger area is used to grow food
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 273.35 279.76 <NA> so this is an amazing kind of result and it really shocked us when we looked at that so we 're using an enormous amount of land for
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 279.72 283.15 <NA> <unk> agriculture but also we 're using a lot of water
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 282.75 290.48 <NA> this is a photograph flying into arizona and when you look at it you 're like what are they growing here it turns out they 're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 290.48 293.41 <NA> using water sprayed on top
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 292.92 297.73 <NA> now the irony is it 's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the twin cities
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 297.6 304.58 <NA> but what 's really interesting is this water 's got to come from some place and it comes from here the colorado river in north america
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 305.05 312.24 <NA> <unk> well the colorado on a typical day in the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s this is just you know not a flood not a drought kind of an average day it looks something like this
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 312.24 319.01 <NA> but if we come back today during a normal condition to the exact same location this is what 's left
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 318.58 325.25 <NA> the difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food or maybe golf courses in scottsdale you take your pick
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 325.03 330 <NA> well this is a lot of water and again we 're mining water and using it to grow food
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 330.44 341.58 <NA> and today if you travel down further down the colorado it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean we 've literally consumed an entire river in north america for irrigation
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 341.45 346.71 <NA> well that 's not even the worst example in the world this probably is the aral sea
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 346.46 354.7 <NA> now a lot you will remember this from your geography classes this is in the former soviet union in between kazakhstan and uzbekistan one of the great
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 355.11 356.62 <NA> <unk> seas of the world
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 356.16 362.41 <NA> but there 's kind of a paradox here because it looks like it 's surrounded by desert why is this sea here
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 361.95 370.19 <NA> the reason it 's here is because on the right hand side you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand feeding this basin with water
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 370.19 379.15 <NA> those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east where snow melts it travels down the river through the desert and forms the great aral sea
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 379.93 392.96 <NA> <unk> fifty s the soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton believe it or not in kazakhstan to sell cotton to the international markets to bring foreign currency into the soviet union they really needed the money
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 392.74 398.76 <NA> well you can imagine what happens you turn off the water supply to the aral sea what 's going to happen here it
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 405.89 411.3 <NA> two thousand and four and about eleven months ago it 's
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 413.57 415.59 <NA> pretty extraordinary
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 415.25 420.72 <NA> now a lot of us in the audience here live in the midwest imagine that was lake superior
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 421.67 430 <NA> imagine that was lake huron it 's an extraordinary change this is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is this is a change
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 430.11 433.03 <NA> <unk> in the fundamentals of the environment of this region
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 432.6 437.9 <NA> let 's start with this the soviet union didn 't really have a sierra club let 's put it that way
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 437.9 445.87 <NA> so what you find in the bottom of the aral sea ain 't pretty there 's a lot of toxic waste a lot of things that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 445.47 450.14 <NA> one of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of soviet
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 450 453.74 <NA> biological weapons testing you can walk there today
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 453.46 461.42 <NA> weather patterns have changed nineteen of the unique twenty fish species found only in the aral sea are now wiped off the face of the earth
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 461.02 464.28 <NA> this is an environmental disaster writ large
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 464.1 465.81 <NA> but let 's bring it home
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 465.81 474.53 <NA> this is a picture that al gore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the soviet union a long long time ago showing the fishing fleets of the aral sea
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 475.04 486 <NA> <unk> you see the canal they dug they were so desperate to try to kind of float the boats into the remaining pools of water but they finally had to give up because the piers and the moorings simply couldn 't keep up with the retreating shoreline
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 485.72 493.44 <NA> i don 't know about you but i 'm terrified that future archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about our time in history and wonder what were you thinking
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 493.28 496.17 <NA> well that 's the future we have to look forward to
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 495.89 503.43 <NA> we already use about fifty percent of the earth 's fresh water that 's sustainable and agriculture alone is seventy percent of that
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 503.51 504.88 <NA> so we use a lot of
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 504.84 510.09 <NA> <unk> water a lot of land for agriculture we also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 510.09 517.18 <NA> usually when we think about the atmosphere we think about climate change and greenhouse gases and mostly around energy
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 516.78 524.33 <NA> but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases too if you look at carbon dioxide from
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 524.33 530 <NA> burning tropical rainforest or methane coming from cows and rice or nitrous oxide from
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 529.99 537.65 <NA> <unk> too many fertilizers it turns out agriculture is thirty percent of the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere from human activity
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 537.19 543.71 <NA> that 's more than all our transportation it 's more than all our electricity it 's more than all other manufacturing in fact
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 543.71 549.23 <NA> it 's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 548.86 551.78 <NA> and yet we don 't talk about it very much
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 551.47 555 <NA> so we have this incredible presence today of agriculture
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 555.11 564.13 <NA> <unk> dominating our planet whether it 's forty percent of our land surface seventy percent of the water we use thirty percent of our greenhouse gas emissions
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 563.95 573.67 <NA> we 've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers causing huge problems of water quality from rivers lakes and even oceans
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 573.67 575.14 <NA> and it 's also the single biggest
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 575 577.27 <NA> driver of biodiversity loss
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 576.96 585.15 <NA> so without a doubt agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 585.15 591.25 <NA> no question and it rivals climate change in importance and they 're both happening at the same time
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 591.42 599.54 <NA> but what 's really important here to remember is that it 's not all bad it 's not that agriculture 's a bad thing in fact we completely depend on it it
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 599.54 604.04 <NA> 's not optional it 's not a luxury it 's an absolute necessity
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 603.86 604.88 <NA> we have to provide
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 604.78 611.57 <NA> <unk> food and feed and yeah fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people in the world today
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 611.26 621.54 <NA> and if anything we 're going to have the demands on agriculture increase into the future it 's not going to go away it 's going to get a lot bigger mainly because of growing population
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 621.49 627.56 <NA> <unk> we 're seven billion people today heading towards at least nine probably nine and a half before we 're done
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 630.1 639.96 <NA> as the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous we 're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 639.59 643.75 <NA> so more people eating more stuff and richer stuff
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 643.75 654.34 <NA> and of course having an energy crisis at the same time where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio energy sources
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 654.87 663.64 <NA> <unk> so you put these together it 's really hard to see how we 're going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 663.42 669.22 <NA> well how are we going to do this how are going to double global ag production around the world
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 668.76 675.65 <NA> well we could try to farm more land this is an analysis we 've done where on the left is where the crops are today
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 675.65 679.85 <NA> on the right is where they could be based on soils and climate
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 679.87 684.32 <NA> <unk> assuming climate change doesn 't disrupt too much of this which is not a good assumption
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 683.92 693.81 <NA> we could farm more land but the problem is the remaining lands are in sensitive areas they have a lot of biodiversity a lot of carbon things we want to protect
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 693.81 701.57 <NA> so we could grow more food by expanding farmland but we 'd better not because it 's ecologically a very very dangerous thing to do
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 701.53 705 <NA> instead we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 705.23 708.06 <NA> <unk> and farm the lands we have better
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 707.69 715.06 <NA> this is work that we 're doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 715.06 724.9 <NA> the green areas here show where corn yields just showing corn as an example are already really high probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 725.4 731.54 <NA> <unk> but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we 're only getting maybe twenty or thirty percent of the yield you should be able to get
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 731.54 741.16 <NA> you see a lot of this in africa even latin america but interestingly eastern europe where soviet union and eastern bloc countries used to be is still a mess agriculturally
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 740.82 749.66 <NA> now this would require nutrients and water it 's going to either be organic or conventional or some mix of the two to deliver that plants need water and nutrients
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 749.66 753.13 <NA> but we can do this and there are opportunities to make this work
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 752.85 754.82 <NA> but we have to do it in a way that
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 754.84 761.27 <NA> <unk> sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 760.81 768.08 <NA> we have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 767.62 775.17 <NA> right now it 's kind of an all or nothing proposition we can grow food in the background that 's a soybean field and in this flower
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 775 782.64 <NA> flower diagram it shows we grow a lot of food but we don 't have a lot clean water we 're not storing a lot of carbon we don 't have a lot of biodiversity
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 782.21 789.33 <NA> in the foreground we have this prairie that 's wonderful from the environmental side but you can 't eat anything what 's there to eat
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 788.9 796.32 <NA> we need to figure out how to bring both of those together into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 795.92 804.7 <NA> now when i talk about this people often tell me well isn 't blank the answer organic food local food gmos new trade
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 804.66 806.53 <NA> <unk> subsidies new farm bills
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 806.33 812 <NA> and yeah we we have a lot of good ideas here but not any one of these is a silver bullet
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 811.82 815.12 <NA> in fact what i think they are is more like silver buckshot
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 815.12 821.74 <NA> and i love silver buckshot you put it together and you 've got something really powerful but we need to put them together
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 821.67 830 <NA> so what we have to do i think is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution
JonathanFoley_2010X 1 JonathanFoley_2010X 830.28 837.15 <NA> with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation conservation
