AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 35.54 46.08 <NA> <unk> as the population of the medina grew basic urban infrastructure such as green open spaces and sewage quickly changed and got highly stressed <unk> 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 46.49 50.5 <NA> one of the biggest casualties of the situation
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 50.28 54.91 <NA> was the fez river which bisects the medina in its middle and has
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 54.87 59.59 <NA> <unk> been considered for many centuries as the city 's very soul 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 59.1 69.76 <NA> in fact one can witness the presence of the river 's extensive water network all throughout the city in places such as private and public fountains <unk> 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 69.87 74.9 <NA> unfortunately <unk> because of the pollution of the river <unk> it has been
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 79.75 92.45 <NA> <unk> this process of erasure was coupled with the destruction of many houses along the river banks to be able to make machineries enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 92.41 98.21 <NA> those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 97.93 103.34 <NA> actually the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 103.12 104.97 <NA> then pollution takes
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 104.93 111.96 <NA> <unk> its toll mainly due to untreated sewage and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning <unk> 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 111.47 121.92 <NA> at some point i couldn 't bear the desecration of the river <unk> such an important part of my city <unk> and i decided to take action especially after i heard <unk>
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 121.82 126.9 <NA> <unk> that the city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 129.9 142.21 <NA> <unk> river became possible and with luck and actually a lot of pushing my partner takako tajima and i were commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers to uncover the river <unk> 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 142.05 148.04 <NA> however we were sneaky and we proposed more to convert riverbanks
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 147.88 154.97 <NA> into pedestrian pathways and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric <unk> and finally to
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 154.96 162.24 <NA> <unk> convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the medina of fez 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 162.24 166.19 <NA> i will show you briefly now two of these public spaces 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 166.69 176.01 <NA> the first one is the rcif plaza which sits actually right on top of the river <unk> which you can see here in dotted lines
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 175.82 179.79 <NA> this plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 180.11 186.39 <NA> <unk> compromised the urban integrity of the medina <unk> that has the largest pedestrian network in the world 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 185.93 195.24 <NA> and right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here right next to the plaza you can see that the river looked like a river of trash
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 194.75 200.29 <NA> <unk> instead what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 200.31 206.65 <NA> <unk> to cover it with recycled leather canopies and to connect it to the banks of the river <unk> 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 206.64 218.65 <NA> the second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks and it used to be an illegal parking and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 218.82 229.88 <NA> the playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but also retains it when floods
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 229.9 239.25 <NA> <unk> occur <unk> as the project progressed and received several design awards <unk> new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 239.01 249.62 <NA> and design the only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us to do something very unusual that usually <unk>
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 249.57 254.91 <NA> architects don 't do it was for us to take our design ego and our sense of
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 254.9 262.44 <NA> <unk> authorship and put it in the backseat and to focus mainly on being activists and on trying to coalesce
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 262.04 272.1 <NA> all of the agendas of stakeholders and focus on the main goals of the project that is to uncover the river <unk> treat its water and provide public spaces for all 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 271.64 279.76 <NA> we were actually very lucky and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening like you can see here in the rcif plaza
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 279.99 282.46 <NA> <unk> how it looked like about six years ago
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 282.09 289.06 <NA> <unk> this is how it looks like today it 's still under construction but actually it is heavily used by the local population <unk> 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 288.63 293.68 <NA> and finally <unk> this is how the rcif plaza will look like when the project is completed <unk> 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 293.67 300.11 <NA> this is the river <unk> covered used as a trash yard <unk> then after many years of work the river
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 302.29 306.65 <NA> <unk> and finally you can see here the river when the project will be completed <unk> 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 306.65 314.13 <NA> so for sure the fez river rehabilitation will keep on changing and adapting to the sociopolitical landscape of the city 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 313.77 323.29 <NA> but we strongly believe that by reimagining the role and the agency of the architect we have set up the core idea of the project into motion 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 323.29 327.69 <NA> that is to transform the river from sewage to public space for all 
AzizaChaouni_2014U 1 AzizaChaouni_2014U 327.45 335.91 <NA> thereby making sure that the city of fez will remain a living city for its inhabitants rather than a mummified heritage <unk> thank you very much
