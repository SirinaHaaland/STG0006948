NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 18.55 25.26 <NA> a beard full of bees now this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 26.66 35.22 <NA> <unk> or maybe anything that has more legs than two <unk> and let me start by telling you i gotcha <unk> i understand that but 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 34.79 46.11 <NA> there are many things to know and i want you to open your minds here keep them open <unk> and change your perspective about honeybees <unk> notice that this man is not getting stung <unk> 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 46.11 54.85 <NA> he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it <unk> so this really demonstrates our relationship with
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 54.78 67.45 <NA> <unk> honeybees <unk> and that goes deep back for thousands of years we 're very co evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 67.25 74.57 <NA> many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing not just dying <unk> but they 're gone we don 't even find dead bodies 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 74.57 79.97 <NA> this is called colony collapse disorder and it 's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 80.05 81.62 <NA> <unk> know what 's causing it 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 81.62 93.6 <NA> but what we do know is that with the declining numbers of bees the costs of over one hundred and thirty fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price <unk> 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 93.21 99.02 <NA> so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 99.02 104.97 <NA> here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs or urban agriculture <unk> we 're familiar with the image on the

NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 141.78 150.14 <NA> and that 's why i want you today to try to think about this think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 150.91 161.12 <NA> <unk> let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on <unk>

NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 191.38 197.38 <NA> and let 's think about urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years

NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 215.05 224.84 <NA> and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the

NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 239.17 248.6 <NA> on a healthier diet <unk> and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 248.26 254.79 <NA> here 's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage

NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 268.25 279.88 <NA> there 's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers <unk> so let 's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 280.07 287.58 <NA> 1980s when the varroa mite came and brought many different viruses bacteria and fungal diseases with it <unk> 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 287.58 297.22 <NA> overwintering success is hard and that 's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 297.03 300.23 <NA> a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees countryside
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 301.27 308.75 <NA> <unk> but that 's not what the bees are showing the bees like it in the city furthermore <unk> they also produce more honey
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 308.59 320.63 <NA> the urban honey is delicious the bees in boston on the rooftop of the seaport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that i 'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 320.17 325.71 <NA> are going to all of the local community gardens and making delicious <unk> healthy honey
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 325.49 327.84 <NA> that just tastes like the flowers in our city
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 329.96 339.52 <NA> <unk> for urban hives in terms of honey production is higher as well as the overwintering survival compared to rural areas <unk> again a bit counterintuitive <unk> 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 339.31 350.04 <NA> and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health we can go back to the year nine hundred and fifty and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in ireland <unk>
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 349.99 354.69 <NA> so the problems of bees today isn 't necessarily something new 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 354.84 366.34 <NA> <unk> has been happening since over a thousand years ago <unk> but what we don 't really notice are these problems in cities <unk> so one thing i want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 366.18 374.96 <NA> you think in the city maybe the temperature 's warmer why are bees doing better in the city this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 375.97 389.44 <NA> <unk> perhaps there 's more pollen in the city with the trains coming in to urban hubs they can carry pollen with them very light pollen and it 's just a big supermarket in the city a lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 389.45 394.31 <NA> perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in [ rural ] areas <unk>

NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 400.31 404.97 <NA> colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees honeybees
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 405.07 410 <NA> are dying <unk> and it 's a huge huge grand challenge of our time 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 409.78 419.49 <NA> what you can see up here is a map of the world and we 're tracking the spread of this varroa mite now the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping <unk> 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 419.49 425.05 <NA> and you can see at the top right the years are changing we 're coming up to modern times and you can see
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 443.76 450.2 <NA> <unk> the varroa mite finally came to north america and to the united states <unk> and that is when the game changed for
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 450 459.18 <NA> for honeybees in the united states many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees on flowers think of the kids today 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 459.18 468.68 <NA> their childhood 's a bit different they don 't experience this the bees just aren 't around anymore <unk> so we need bees and they 're disappearing and it 's a big problem 
NoahWilsonRich_2012X 1 NoahWilsonRich_2012X 468.61 475.02 <NA> what can we do here so what i do is honeybee research i got my ph d studying honeybee health
