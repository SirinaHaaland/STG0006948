SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 12.73 21.93 <NA> <unk> learn how to play the lobster we have some here <unk> and that 's not a joke we really do so come up afterwards and i 'll show you how to play a lobster so actually i started
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 21.93 24.9 <NA> working on what 's called the mantis shrimp a few years
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 25.7 29.37 <NA> <unk> because they make sound this is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 28.91 31.47 <NA> that 's found off the coast of california <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 41.99 45.21 <NA> and while that 's an absolutely fascinating sound
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 45.21 48.18 <NA> <unk> it actually turns out to be a very difficult project 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 47.78 50.11 <NA> and while i was struggling
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 50 63.47 <NA> <unk> to figure out how and why mantis shrimp or stomatopods make sound i started to think about their appendages <unk> and mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises which also have a fast feeding appendage <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 63.47 65.14 <NA> and i started to think well maybe it will
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 64.68 68.68 <NA> be interesting <unk> while listening to their sounds to figure out how these animals
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 68.45 71.75 <NA> generate very fast feeding strikes and so today i 'll talk about
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 71.75 79.97 <NA> the extreme stomatopod strike work that i 've done in collaboration with wyatt korff and roy caldwell so mantis shrimp come in two varieties
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 80.25 89.84 <NA> <unk> there are spearers and smashers and this is a spearing mantis shrimp or stomatopod <unk> and he lives in the sand <unk> and he catches things that go by overhead 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 89.53 93.05 <NA> so a quick strike like that 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 92.8 97.62 <NA> and if we slow it down a bit this is the mantis shrimp the same species
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 97.46 104.43 <NA> recorded at one thousand frames a second <unk> played back at fifteen frames per second <unk> and you can see it 's just a really spectacular
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 105.17 111.31 <NA> <unk> of the limbs <unk> exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that i
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 111.13 114.4 <NA> had offered it now the other type of mantis shrimp
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 114.4 121.71 <NA> is the smasher stomatopod <unk> and these guys open up snails for a living and so this guy
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 122 124.87 <NA> gets the snail all set up and gives it a good
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 127.14 130.69 <NA> <unk> play it one more time he wiggles it in place tugs it with his nose and
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 131.49 134.65 <NA> smash and a few smashes later
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 134.67 141.22 <NA> <unk> the snail is broken open and he 's got a good dinner <unk> so the smasher raptorial appendage
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 140.82 154.97 <NA> can stab with a point at the end or it can smash with the heel <unk> and today i 'll talk about the smashing type of strike <unk> and so the first question that came to mind was well how fast does this limb move because it 's moving pretty darn fast
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 155.01 156.23 <NA> on that video <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 155.77 168.53 <NA> and i immediately came upon a problem every single high speed video system in the biology department at berkeley wasn 't fast enough to catch this movement we simply couldn 't capture it on video <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 168.52 176.36 <NA> and so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time and then a bbc crew came cruising through the biology department looking for a story
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 176.23 180 <NA> to do about new technologies in biology and so we struck
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 180.02 187.83 <NA> <unk> up a deal <unk> i said well if you guys rent the high speed video system that could capture these movements you guys can film us
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 187.34 196.41 <NA> collecting the data and believe it or not they went for it so we got this incredible video system <unk> it 's very new technology it just came out about a year ago
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 196.13 204.82 <NA> that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light and low light is a critical issue with filming animals because if it 's too high
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 204.9 207.49 <NA> <unk> fry them so
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 207.24 218.43 <NA> this is a mantis shrimp <unk> there are the eyes up here <unk> and there 's that raptorial appendage and there 's the heel and that thing 's going to swing around and smash the snail <unk> and the snail 's wired to a stick <unk>
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 218.43 221.17 <NA> <unk> so he 's a little bit easier to set up the shot and yeah 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 223.65 224.99 <NA> i hope there aren 't any
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 231.25 233.94 <NA> <unk> this was filmed at five thousand frames per second <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 233.94 242.55 <NA> and i 'm playing it back at fifteen <unk> and so this is slowed down three hundred and thirty three times <unk> and as you 'll notice it 's still pretty gosh darn fast
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 242.31 249.63 <NA> slowed down three hundred and thirty three times it 's an incredibly powerful movement <unk> the whole limb extends out the body flexes backwards just a
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 251.96 260.97 <NA> <unk> and so what we did is we took a look at these videos and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question and we were in for our first surprise <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 260.6 270.96 <NA> so what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from ten meters per second all the way up to twenty three meters per second and for those of you who prefer miles per hour that 's over <unk>
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 270.91 278.85 <NA> forty five miles per hour in water <unk> and this is really darn fast in fact it 's so fast we were able to add a new point
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 279.81 287.92 <NA> <unk> extreme animal movement spectrum <unk> and mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system <unk> so our first surprise 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 289.74 295.9 <NA> so that was really cool and very unexpected so you might be wondering well how do they do it 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 295.59 299.87 <NA> and actually this work was done in the 1960s by a famous
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 300 301.4 <NA> biologist named malcolm burrows <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 301.2 311.4 <NA> and what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what 's called a catch mechanism or click mechanism and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 311.35 324.24 <NA> <unk> takes a good long time to contract and a latch that prevents anything from moving so the muscle contracts <unk> and nothing happens and once the muscle 's contracted completely everything 's stored up the latch flies upward and
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 329.95 332.73 <NA> and a very short time for the limb to fly out
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 332.3 340.98 <NA> and so i thought that this was sort of the end of the story <unk> this was how mantis <unk> shrimps make these very fast strikes <unk> but then i took a trip to
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 340.98 350.08 <NA> the national museum of natural history <unk> and if any of you ever have a chance <unk> backstage of the national museum of natural history is one of the world 's best collections of preserved mantis
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 352.23 357.01 <NA> <unk> this is serious business for me so this
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 356.67 366.49 <NA> what i saw on every single mantis shrimp limb whether it 's a spearer or a smasher is a beautiful saddle shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 366.49 375.64 <NA> and you can see it right here it just looks like a saddle you 'd put on a horse it 's a very beautiful structure <unk> and it 's surrounded by membranous areas and
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 375.3 379.7 <NA> those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 379.66 385.82 <NA> <unk> structure <unk> and this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while and then we did a
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 385.36 393.29 <NA> series of calculations and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring there needs to be some kind of <unk>
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 394.29 400.17 <NA> mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe and the speed that we observe <unk> and the output of the system
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 400.55 402.69 <NA> <unk> so we thought ok <unk> this must be
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 402.52 413.34 <NA> a spring the saddle could very well be a spring and we went back to those high speed videos again <unk> and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 413.03 415.77 <NA> and i 'll just do that one more time <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 415.88 423.67 <NA> and then if you take a look at the video it 's a little bit hard to see it 's outlined in yellow the saddle is outlined in yellow you can actually see it extending
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 423.49 428.86 <NA> over the course of the strike and actually hyperextending <unk> so we 've had very solid evidence showing that that
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 430.1 443.48 <NA> actually compresses and extends <unk> and does in fact function as a spring the saddle shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface or an anticlastic surface and this is very well known to engineers and architects <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 443.48 446.62 <NA> because it 's a very strong surface in compression
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 446.28 454.94 <NA> <unk> it has curves in two directions one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 455.04 463.97 <NA> of of this type of shape <unk> so it 's very well known to to engineers not as well known to biologists it 's also known to quite a few
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 463.74 468.2 <NA> people who make jewelry because it requires very little material
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 468.19 474.78 <NA> to build this type of surface and it 's very strong so if you 're going to build a thin gold structure it 's very nice to have it in a shape that 's
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 476.24 478.44 <NA> <unk> also known to architects 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 478.21 489.48 <NA> one of the most famous architects is eduardo catalano who popularized this structure <unk> and what 's shown here is a saddle shaped roof that he built that 's eighty seven and a half feet spanwise <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 489.48 493.9 <NA> it 's two and a half inches thick and supported at two points <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 493.66 500.23 <NA> and one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it 's he found it fascinating that you could build
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 500.06 504.97 <NA> such a strong structure that 's made of so few materials and can be supported
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 504.96 518.29 <NA> <unk> by so few points and all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddle shaped spring in stomatopods in biological systems it 's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 517.89 529.94 <NA> so very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds and interestingly this turns out the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 529.81 540.02 <NA> <unk> spring that 's a bit long but it is sort of interesting <unk> so the next and final question was well how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they 're able to break open snails <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 539.59 549.53 <NA> and so i wired up what 's called a load cell <unk> a load cell measures forces and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it and when this crystal is squeezed
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 549.07 554.94 <NA> the electrical properties change and it which in proportion to the forces that go in so these animals
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 554.9 563.62 <NA> <unk> are wonderfully aggressive and are really hungry all the time <unk> and so all i had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell <unk> and they 'd smash away at it <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 563.62 565.08 <NA> and so this is <unk>
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 564.86 570.18 <NA> this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 571.22 574.87 <NA> and we were able to get some force measurements out and again we were in
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 578.61 593.61 <NA> <unk> no animal could produce more than one hundred pounds at this size of an animal <unk> and what do you know they immediately overloaded the load cell <unk> so these are actually some old data where i had to find the smallest animals in the lab <unk> and we were able to measure forces of well over one hundred pounds generated by an animal about this big <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 593.61 599.9 <NA> and actually just last week i got a 300 pound load cell up and running <unk> and i 've clocked these animals generating well
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 600 605.15 <NA> <unk> two hundred pounds of force and again i think this will be a world record i have to do a little bit more
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 605.38 611.15 <NA> background reading but i think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 610.66 620.06 <NA> per body mass so really incredible forces and again that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 621.19 624.96 <NA> <unk> but that was not the end of the story now <unk> things i 'm making this
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 625 633.87 <NA> <unk> very easy this is actually a lot of work and i got all these force measurements and then i went and looked at the force output of the system and this is just very simple time is on the <unk>
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 634.87 641.01 <NA> the force is on the y axis and you can see two peaks <unk> and that was what really got me puzzled 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 641.57 649.99 <NA> the first peak obviously is the limb hitting the load cell <unk> but there 's a really large second peak half a millisecond later
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 653.19 658.66 <NA> <unk> you 'd expect a second peak for other reasons but not half a half a millisecond later 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 658.5 663.22 <NA> again going back to those high speed videos there 's a pretty good hint of what might be going on 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 663.69 675.02 <NA> here 's that same orientation that we saw earlier <unk> there 's that raptorial appendage there 's the heel and it 's going to swing around and hit the load cell and what i 'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 675.7 679.73 <NA> <unk> on the surface of the load cell as the limb comes
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 679.3 685.7 <NA> flying through <unk> and i hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light audience wow sheila patek 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 687.37 694.13 <NA> and so if we just take that one frame what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 694.12 696.75 <NA> and what that is is cavitation 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 696.51 701.06 <NA> and cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 701.17 704.94 <NA> which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 705.13 712.33 <NA> when this happens <unk> it can cause areas of very low pressure <unk> which results in the water literally vaporizing <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 712.33 720.36 <NA> and when that vapor bubble collapses it emits sound light and heat and it 's a very destructive process <unk> and so here it is in the
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 720.23 724.9 <NA> stomatopod and again this is a situation where engineers are very
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 725 739.72 <NA> familiar with this phenomenon because it destroys boat propellers people have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn 't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it just like these pictures show 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 739.29 740.54 <NA> so
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 740.38 742.18 <NA> this is a potent
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 742.95 745.75 <NA> force in fluid systems 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 745.38 754.94 <NA> and just to sort of take it one step further i 'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail this is taken at twenty thousand frames per second <unk> and i have to
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 754.87 761.66 <NA> <unk> give full credit to the bbc cameraman tim green for setting this shot up because i could never have done this in a million years
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 761.35 765.86 <NA> one of the benefits of of working with professional cameramen 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 765.55 772.37 <NA> you can see it coming in and an incredible flash of light and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 772.78 777.17 <NA> so really just an amazing image <unk> slowed down
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 776.77 779.61 <NA> extremely to extremely slow speeds
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 780.11 783.01 <NA> <unk> and again we can see it in slightly different form there 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 783.01 790.32 <NA> with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces in fact you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 791.54 804.97 <NA> so to solve this quandary of the two force peaks what i think was going on is that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell <unk> and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble <unk> and these animals may very well be making use of not
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 805.02 810.46 <NA> <unk> only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring but the extremes
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 810.15 817.18 <NA> of the fluid dynamics and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 816.72 820.21 <NA> so really fascinating double whammy so to speak
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 819.84 827.12 <NA> <unk> from these animals so one question i often get after this talk so i figured i 'd answer it now
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 826.96 828.41 <NA> is well what happens to the animal
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 829.96 844.31 <NA> <unk> it 's breaking snails the poor limb must be disintegrating and indeed it does that 's the smashing part of the heel on both these images and it gets worn away in fact i 've seen them wear wear away their heel all the way to the flesh <unk> but one of the convenient things about being an arthropod
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 844.31 850.02 <NA> is that you have to molt <unk> and every three months or so these animals molt <unk> and they build a new limb and it 's no
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 852.17 855.18 <NA> <unk> very convenient solution to that particular problem
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 855.53 860.88 <NA> <unk> so i 'd like to end on sort of a wacky note laughter
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 864.29 867.54 <NA> maybe this is all wacky to to folks like you i don 't know 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 869.27 874.93 <NA> so the saddles that saddle shaped spring has actually been well known to
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 875 881.5 <NA> biologists for a long time not as a spring but as a visual signal <unk> and there 's actually a spectacular
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 881.33 887.15 <NA> colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods <unk> 
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 887.15 892.93 <NA> and this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 892.65 899.99 <NA> what 's really in all species their spring <unk> and i think one explanation for this could be going back to
SheilaPatek_2004 1 SheilaPatek_2004 901.36 909.47 <NA> <unk> so these animals go into a molting period where they 're unable to strike their bodies become very soft <unk> and they 're literally unable to strike or they will <unk>
