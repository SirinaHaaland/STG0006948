PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 223.76 226.39 <NA> you imagine tossing a coin successively
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 225.93 229.94 <NA> and for some reason which shall remain rather vague
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 229.98 239.24 <NA> we 're interested in a particular pattern here 's one a head followed by a tail followed by a tail <unk> so suppose we toss a coin repeatedly then the pattern <unk>
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 240.16 250.02 <NA> <unk> that we 've suddenly become fixated with happens here and you can count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten it happens after the 10th toss <unk> so you might think there are more interesting
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 250 256.86 <NA> <unk> things to do but humor me for the moment imagine this half of the audience each get out coins and they toss them until they first see the pattern <unk>
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 257.99 267.12 <NA> first time they do it maybe it happens after the 10th toss as here the second time maybe it 's after the fourth toss the next time after the 15th toss so you do that lots and lots of times and you average those numbers
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 267.08 268.62 <NA> that 's what i want
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 268.28 271.66 <NA> this side to think about the other half of the audience
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 271.66 279.97 <NA> doesn 't like head tail tail they think for deep cultural reasons that 's boring and they 're much more interested in a different pattern head tail head so on this side you get out your coins
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 279.96 285.85 <NA> <unk> and you toss and toss and toss and you count the number of times until the pattern head tail head appears and you average them <unk> 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 286.5 293.05 <NA> ok so on this side you 've got a number you 've done it lots of times so you get it accurately which is the average number of tosses until <unk>

PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 820.47 824.72 <NA> will know about what 's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called sally
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 825.46 835.04 <NA> <unk> who had two babies who died suddenly and initially it was thought that they died of what 's known informally as cot death and more formally as sudden infant death syndrome 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 835.21 847.74 <NA> for various reasons she was later charged with murder and at the trial her trial a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths <unk> innocent deaths in a family like hers which was professional and
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 855.05 861.06 <NA> <unk> at the time <unk> later and fairly recently acquitted on appeal in fact on the second appeal
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 861.11 868.02 <NA> and just to set it in context you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child and then two 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 867.89 876.85 <NA> if they 're innocent to be convicted of murdering them to be put through the stress of the trial convicted of murdering them and to spend time in a women 's prison where all the other prisoners think you killed your children is a
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 876.85 878.74 <NA> really awful thing to happen to someone
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 880.2 884.44 <NA> <unk> and it happened in large part here because the expert
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 884.49 891.55 <NA> got the statistics horribly wrong <unk> in two different ways so where did he get the one in seventy three million number 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 891.9 899.62 <NA> he looked at some research which said the chance of one cot death in a family like sally clark 's is about one in eight thousand five hundred 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 901.54 908.03 <NA> <unk> 'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren 't changed 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 908.08 916.4 <NA> so that 's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence <unk> it 's like saying if you toss a coin and get a head the first time that won 't affect the chance of getting a head the second time 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 916.09 920.28 <NA> so if you toss a coin twice the chance of getting a head twice
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 920.11 925.01 <NA> are a half that 's the chance the first time times a half the chance a second time <unk> 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 926.96 928.5 <NA> <unk> assume that these
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 928.1 933.39 <NA> events are independent when you multiply eight thousand five hundred together twice you get about <unk> seventy three million 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 933.39 938.22 <NA> and none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 938.6 942.15 <NA> unfortunately here and really regrettably
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 941.78 944.71 <NA> first of all in a situation like this you 'd have to verify
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 944.5 953.37 <NA> it empirically <unk> and secondly it 's palpably false there are lots and lots of things that we don 't know about sudden infant deaths <unk> 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 953.57 954.97 <NA> it might well be
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 954.9 960.73 <NA> <unk> that there are environmental factors that we 're not aware of and it 's pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we 're not aware of <unk> 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 960.75 969.49 <NA> so if a family suffers from one cot death you 'd put them in a high risk group they 've probably got these environmental risk factors and or genetic risk factors we don 't know about 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 969.33 973.75 <NA> and to argue then that the chance of a second death is as if you didn 't know that information
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 973.26 979.94 <NA> is really silly it 's worse than silly it 's really bad science nonetheless

PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 989.83 993.71 <NA> so after sally clark was convicted you can imagine it made rather

PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 996.6 1004.7 <NA> one of the journalists from from one of britain 's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1004.87 1008.21 <NA> <unk> was the chance that she was innocent was one in seventy three million 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1010.12 1020.42 <NA> that 's a logical error <unk> it 's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test which is ninety nine percent accurate the chance of having the disease is ninety nine percent

PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1036.47 1044.54 <NA> there are two things involved two parts to the explanation we want to know how likely or relatively how likely two different explanations are 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1044.54 1047.89 <NA> one of them is that sally clark was innocent
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1047.68 1049.9 <NA> which is a priori overwhelmingly likely

PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1052.2 1061.09 <NA> and the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event not as unlikely as one in seventy three million but nonetheless rather unlikely <unk> 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1061.05 1071.08 <NA> the other explanation is that she was guilty now we probably think a priori that 's unlikely and we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that 's unlikely because of the presumption of innocence <unk> 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1071.04 1074.8 <NA> and then if she were trying to kill the children she succeeded 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1074.88 1079.97 <NA> so the chance that she 's innocent isn 't one in <unk> seventy three million we don 't know what it
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1079.96 1087.65 <NA> <unk> is <unk> it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1088.18 1093.26 <NA> we know the children died what matters is how likely or unlikely 
PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1092.8 1097.46 <NA> relative to each other the two explanations are and they 're both implausible

PeterDonnelly_2005G 1 PeterDonnelly_2005G 1099.55 1104.31 <NA> errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences
