KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 59.64 62.6 <NA> we spent a long time thinking about why this is
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 62.6 69.79 <NA> and it 's just recently that we realized it 's when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 69.84 75.14 <NA> as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 80.8 88.08 <NA> now it 's important to understand what the unexpected properties are but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 88.08 91.4 <NA> we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 91.78 99.5 <NA> so first idea is to use it on cabinet doors if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 99.64 104.79 <NA> if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn 't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 141.6 148.12 <NA> it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in la and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 147.84 154.79 <NA> he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company the directors bureau but like as we were talking

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 162.04 170.96 <NA> and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder he opens it up and keith keith and i look in
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 170.65 178.68 <NA> and he starts showing us concepts that he 's been working on these things just get him really excited and so we 're looking at these concepts and

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 184.33 192.69 <NA> like the way that he presented the concept his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 193.19 199.71 <NA> when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking like why was this so powerful
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 199.88 204.88 <NA> and as we thought about it more we realized it let you fill in all the details about the

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 207.54 214.48 <NA> so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 214.17 217.73 <NA> to create a commercial for a product a product from the future
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 250 257.58 <NA> we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when it 's coming out so i just wanted to let you know it 's not actually coming out just the concepts
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 258.32 264.3 <NA> so now when we dream up these concepts it 's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 263.99 266.7 <NA> so i just want to quickly explain how this would work
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 266.36 273.24 <NA> this is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial the gel that you 're holding would be lining the bottom of the board
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 272.75 280 <NA> now this is important for two reasons one the soft properties of the magnet that make it so if it were to hit the rider in the head it wouldn 't injure him in addition
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 280.05 292.94 <NA> <unk> you can see from the diagram on the right the under part of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you 're going down the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 292.94 295.69 <NA> it 's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 295.8 298.36 <NA> when you get to the very bottom of the slide
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 299.1 304.94 <NA> the rider passes through an aluminum tube and i 'm going to kick it to keith to explain why that 's important from a technical standpoint so i 'm sure all you

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 309.85 316.29 <NA> but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 334.82 337.29 <NA> <unk> now you see the magnet fell really slowly
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 336.86 339.12 <NA> now i 'm not going to get into the physics of it
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 339.12 347.79 <NA> but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling the greater the stopping force now our next technology is actually a ten foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 351.74 353.86 <NA> there 's a few different versions of it
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 358.44 361.48 <NA> some of them automatically unroll like this one
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 361.02 367.72 <NA> they can be made to automatically roll up or they can be made stable like zach 's to hold any position in between
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 370.77 374.59 <NA> so now as we were talking to the vendor to try to learn about
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 374.16 377.56 <NA> how you could apply these or how they 're being applied currently

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 389.2 396.17 <NA> in our brainstorms we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 398.23 400.14 <NA> now the interesting thing about this

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 509.61 514.3 <NA> now the reason it 's cold is that 's it 's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns

KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 547.42 554.94 <NA> so what 's the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 555.29 568.14 <NA> now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we 'd damage the electronics that we 'd get him wet that we 'd hurt the books or the computers
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 567.83 580 <NA> it works because it 's non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn 't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away but today it 's most widely used in office buildings in the sprinkler system as
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 580.13 584.78 <NA> a fire suppression fluid again it 's perfectly safe for people it puts out the fires doesn 't hurt anything
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 584.54 588.25 <NA> but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 1 KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005 588.25 594.46 <NA> so during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry wouldn 't hurt the court
