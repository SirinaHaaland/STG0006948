AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 13.24 22.43 <NA> <unk> start by posing a little bit of a challenge the challenge of dealing with data <unk> data that we have to deal with in medical
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 21.94 29.94 <NA> situations <unk> it 's really a huge challenge for us <unk> and this is our beast of burden this is a computer tomography machine
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 29.95 33.25 <NA> a ct machine it 's a fantastic device it uses <unk>
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 34.79 40.75 <NA> <unk> beams that are rotating very fast around the human body <unk> it takes about thirty seconds to go through the whole machine
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 40.75 48.4 <NA> and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine <unk> so this is a fantastic machine that we can use for
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 48.19 49.92 <NA> improving health care
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 50 52.72 <NA> but as i said it 's also a challenge for us
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 52.41 61.24 <NA> and the challenge is really found in this picture here it 's the the medical data explosion that we 're having right now we 're facing this problem <unk> and
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 61.07 70.09 <NA> let me step back in time let 's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then these machines that came out they started coming in the 1970s
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 69.72 79.85 <NA> they would scan human bodies and they would generate about one hundred images of the human body <unk> and i 've taken the liberty just for clarity to translate that to data
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 79.81 85.58 <NA> <unk> slices that would correspond to about fifty megabytes of data <unk> which is small
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 85.33 90.42 <NA> when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 90.42 95.48 <NA> if you translate that to phone books <unk> it 's about one meter of phone books in the pile <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 95.26 104.97 <NA> looking at what we 're doing today with these machines that we have we can just in a few seconds get twenty four thousand images out of a body <unk> and that would correspond to about
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 105.08 112.48 <NA> <unk> twenty gigabytes of data or eight hundred phone books and the pile would then be two hundred meters of phone books what 's about to happen
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 112.48 125.14 <NA> and we 're seeing this it 's beginning a technology trend that 's happening right now is that we 're starting to look at time resolved situations as well <unk> so we 're getting the dynamics out of the body as well <unk> and just assume that we will be collecting data
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 125 129.85 <NA> during five seconds and that would correspond to one terabyte of data
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 129.78 137.38 <NA> that 's eight hundred thousand books and sixteen kilometers of phone books <unk> that 's one patient one data set <unk> and this is what we have to deal with <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 137.55 143.05 <NA> so this is really the enormous challenge that we have and already today this is twenty five thousand images
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 143.07 148.67 <NA> <unk> imagine the the days when we had radiologists doing this <unk> they would put up
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 155.01 159.74 <NA> <unk> that 's impossible <unk> so we have to do something that 's a little bit more intelligent than doing this <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 159.88 165.34 <NA> so what we do is that we put all these slices together imagine that you slice your body in all these directions <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 165.35 174.84 <NA> and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data into a block of data <unk> so this is really what we 're doing so this gigabyte or terabyte of data we 're putting it into this
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 175.61 181.68 <NA> <unk> but of course the block of data just contains the amount of x ray that 's been absorbed in each point in the human body <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 181.45 189.1 <NA> so what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don 't want to look at <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 189.1 193.38 <NA> so transforming the data set into something that looks like this <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 192.98 197.28 <NA> and this is a challenge this is a huge challenge for us to do that 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 197.06 200.08 <NA> using computers even though they 're getting faster and better
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 200.04 205.15 <NA> <unk> all the time <unk> it 's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data terabytes of data
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 204.96 210.58 <NA> and extracting the relevant information i want to look at the heart i want to look at the blood vessels <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 210.58 215.2 <NA> i want to look at the liver maybe even find a tumor in some cases
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 215.1 222.98 <NA> <unk> so this is where this little dear comes into play this is my daughter <unk> this is as of nine a m this morning
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 222.81 225.73 <NA> she 's playing a computer game she 's only two years old
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 225.72 229.82 <NA> and she 's having a blast <unk> so she 's really
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 229.78 234.86 <NA> <unk> the driving force behind the development of graphics processing units 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 234.79 243.5 <NA> as long as kids are playing computer games graphics is getting better and better and better so please go back home tell your kids to play more games because that 's what i need <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 243.1 248.87 <NA> so what 's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that i 'm doing with the medical data
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 248.86 254.43 <NA> <unk> so really what i 'm doing is using these fantastic little devices <unk> and you know going back maybe
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 255.44 265.47 <NA> <unk> ten years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer it was a huge machine <unk> it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 265.47 268.23 <NA> i paid about one million dollars for that machine 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 268.64 275.05 <NA> that machine is today about as fast as my iphone <unk> so
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 274.86 279.58 <NA> every month there are new graphics cards coming out and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 281.13 285.32 <NA> <unk> intel is out there as well <unk> and you know for a few hundred bucks you can get these
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 285.08 294.5 <NA> things and put them into your computer and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards <unk> so this is really what 's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 294.5 303.7 <NA> together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms compressing data extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on <unk> so
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 303.36 305 <NA> i 'm going to show you a few examples
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 305.02 311.07 <NA> <unk> of what we can do this is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner <unk> you can see that this is
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 310.83 318.59 <NA> a full data [ set ] it 's a woman you can see the hair you can see the individual structures of the woman 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 318.28 324.36 <NA> you can see that there is [ a ] scattering of x rays on the teeth the metal in the teeth that 's
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 324.17 327.17 <NA> where those artifacts are coming from but
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 326.92 329.79 <NA> fully interactively on standard graphics
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 330.13 338.7 <NA> on a normal computer i can just put in a clip plane and of course all the data is inside <unk> so i can start rotating i can look at it from different angles
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 338.45 343.89 <NA> and i can see that this woman had a problem she had a bleeding up in the brain 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 343.55 352.44 <NA> and that 's been fixed with a little stent a metal clamp that 's tightening up the vessel <unk> and just by changing the functions then i can decide what 's going to be transparent
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 352.07 354.58 <NA> and what 's going to be visible <unk> i can look at
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 355.11 364.18 <NA> <unk> the skull structure <unk> and i can see that okay this is where they opened up the skull on this woman <unk> and that 's where they went in so these are fantastic images they 're really high resolution
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 363.78 367.27 <NA> and they 're really showing us what we can do with
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 367.02 374.84 <NA> with standard graphics cards today now we have really made use of this and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 375.64 381.72 <NA> <unk> into the system <unk> and one of the applications that we 've been working on and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 381.54 384.1 <NA> is the application of virtual autopsies 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 384.11 392.12 <NA> so again looking at very very large data sets and you saw those full body scans that we can do we 're just pushing the body through the whole ct scanner
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 391.87 399.99 <NA> <unk> and just in a few seconds we can get a full body data set <unk> so this is from a virtual autopsy <unk> and you can see how i 'm gradually peeling off
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 400 406.92 <NA> first you saw the body bag that the body came in then i 'm peeling off the skin you can see the muscles and eventually you can see the bone structure
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 406.72 408.36 <NA> of this woman <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 408.17 417.64 <NA> now at this point i would also like to emphasize that with the greatest respect for the people that i 'm now going to show i 'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 417.43 423.63 <NA> so it 's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that i 'm showing these pictures to you 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 425.97 431.23 <NA> <unk> in the forensic case and this is something that there 's been approximately four hundred cases so far
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 431.03 433.67 <NA> just in the part of sweden that i come from
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 433.49 437.26 <NA> that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 436.83 449.99 <NA> so this will be the typical workflow situation the police will decide in the evening when there 's a case coming in they will decide okay is this a case where we need to do an autopsy <unk> so in the morning in between six and seven in the
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 450.67 456.63 <NA> <unk> the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the ct scanners <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 456.63 467.87 <NA> and then the radiologist together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist looks at the data that 's coming out and they have a joint session and then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 468.94 474.63 <NA> now looking at a few cases here 's one of the first cases that we had you can really see the
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 478.64 482.28 <NA> <unk> our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 482.09 488.35 <NA> and again it 's fully interactive so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 488.35 494.04 <NA> without saying too much about this case this is a traffic accident a drunk driver hit a woman <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 493.91 499.86 <NA> and it 's very very easy to see the damages on the bone structure <unk> and the cause of death is the broken neck <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 499.37 504.97 <NA> and this women also ended up under the car <unk> so she 's quite badly beaten up by this
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 506.52 508.03 <NA> here 's another case 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 508.03 516.13 <NA> a knifing and this is also again showing us what we can do <unk> it 's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 515.91 524.93 <NA> you can also see some of the artifacts from from the teeth that 's actually the filling of the teeth but because i 've set the functions to show me metal and make everything
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 526.42 535.13 <NA> <unk> here 's another violent case this really didn 't kill the person the person was killed by stabs in the heart <unk> but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 535.54 544.19 <NA> here 's another case it 's very very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings <unk> here you can see that knife went through the heart <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 543.91 549.75 <NA> it 's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part which is difficult to do in a normal
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 553.79 562.17 <NA> <unk> the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 562.07 568.54 <NA> here 's another case that i think is interesting here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 568.21 569.49 <NA> on this person 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 569.49 579.97 <NA> and what we 've done is that we 've turned the bullet into a light source so that bullet is actually shining and it makes it really easy to find these fragments <unk> during a physical autopsy <unk> if you actually have to dig through the
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 579.9 582.88 <NA> <unk> body to find these fragments that 's actually quite hard to do 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 585.57 588.04 <NA> one of the things that i 'm really really happy
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 587.84 592.18 <NA> to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 592.18 598.04 <NA> it 's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms using standard graphics gpus 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 597.86 602.06 <NA> it actually looks like this just to give you a feeling for what it looks like
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 601.87 604.79 <NA> <unk> it really just works like a huge iphone
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 605.1 610.04 <NA> <unk> so we 've implemented all the gestures you can do on on the table
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 609.85 618.5 <NA> <unk> and you can think of it as an as an enormous touch interface <unk> so if you were thinking of buying an ipad forget about it this is what you want instead
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 618.67 621.47 <NA> <unk> steve i hope you 're listening to this all
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 622.27 628.2 <NA> right so it 's a very nice little device so if you have the opportunity please try it out it 's really
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 630.05 639.33 <NA> so it gained some traction <unk> and we 're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes but also perhaps in the future in a more clinical
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 639.16 646.29 <NA> situation <unk> there 's a youtube video that you can download and look at this if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 646.61 649.99 <NA> okay now that we 're talking about touch <unk> let me move on to really
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 652.08 660.91 <NA> <unk> and this is a bit of science fiction now so we 're moving into really the future <unk> this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now but i hope they will in the future <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 660.91 663.35 <NA> so what you 're seeing on the left is
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 663.02 669.37 <NA> a touch device <unk> it 's a little mechanical pen that has very very fast step motors inside of the pen and
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 669.15 674.99 <NA> so i can generate a force feedback so when i virtually touch data <unk> it will generate forces in the pen <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 675 676.4 <NA> i get a feedback
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 676.09 680.49 <NA> <unk> so in this particular situation <unk> it 's a scan of a living person <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 680.49 687.56 <NA> i have this pen <unk> and i look at the data and i move the pen towards the head <unk> and all of a sudden i feel resistance 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 687.13 689.12 <NA> so i can feel the skin <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 688.96 694.28 <NA> if i push a little bit harder i 'll go through the skin and i can feel the bone structure inside <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 693.79 699.93 <NA> if i push even harder i 'll go through the bone structure especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft <unk> and then i can
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 700 702.69 <NA> <unk> the brain inside and this will be the slushy like this <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 703.25 707.49 <NA> so this is really nice and to take that even further this is a heart <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 707.49 714.67 <NA> and this is also due to these fantastic new scanners that just in in zero point three seconds i can scan the whole heart <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 714.28 718.45 <NA> and i can do that with time resolution <unk> so just looking at this heart
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 718.45 725.17 <NA> <unk> i can play back a video here <unk> and this is karljohan one of my graduate students who 's been working on this project and he 's sitting there in front of the haptic
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 725.61 729.36 <NA> <unk> the force feedback system <unk> and he 's moving his pen
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 729.14 734.05 <NA> towards the heart <unk> and the heart is now beating in front of him so he can see how the heart is beating he
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 733.62 739.84 <NA> 's taken the pen <unk> and he 's moving it towards the heart <unk> and he 's putting it on the heart and then he feels the heartbeats
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 739.35 748.27 <NA> from the real living patient <unk> then he can examine how the heart is moving <unk> he can go inside push inside of the heart <unk> and really feel how the valves are moving 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 748.35 749.84 <NA> and this i think is really the
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 750.73 754.2 <NA> <unk> for heart surgeons i mean it 's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 754.02 761.2 <NA> to be able to to go inside of the patient 's heart before you actually do surgery and do that with high quality resolution data
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 761.04 765.43 <NA> so this is really neat <unk> now we 're going
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 765.44 771.6 <NA> even further into science fiction <unk> and we heard a little bit about functional mri now
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 771.36 779.97 <NA> this is really an interesting project <unk> mri is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain or any part of the body
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 780.16 786.77 <NA> <unk> so what we 're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain but we can also measure the difference
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 786.78 792.28 <NA> in magnetic properties of blood that 's oxygenated and blood that 's depleted of oxygen
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 791.8 794.59 <NA> that means that it 's possible to map out
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 794.38 796.47 <NA> the activity of the brain <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 796.4 804.97 <NA> so this is something that we 've been working on and you just saw motts the research engineer there going into the mri system <unk> and he was wearing goggles
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 805.19 811.88 <NA> <unk> so he could actually see things in the goggles so i could present things to him while he 's in the scanner and this is a little bit freaky <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 811.88 816.34 <NA> because what motts is seeing is actually this he 's seeing his own brain <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 817.08 823.91 <NA> so motts is doing something here and probably he is going like this with his right hand because the left side is is activated
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 823.73 824.9 <NA> on the motor cortex
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 825.22 827.75 <NA> <unk> and then he can see that at the same time 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 827.26 832.48 <NA> these visualizations are brand new <unk> and this is something that we 've been researching for a little while <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 832.49 839.51 <NA> this is another sequence of motts ' brain and here we asked motts to calculate backwards from one hundred so he 's going one hundred <unk>
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 840.94 845.58 <NA> <unk> and then he 's going backwards <unk> and you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 845.58 854.97 <NA> and is lighting up the whole brain well this is fantastic we can do this in real time we can investigate things we can tell him to do things you can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 855.11 861.1 <NA> because that 's where he 's seeing he 's seeing his own brain and he 's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 861.1 867.39 <NA> the signal is really deep inside of the brain as well and it 's shining through because all of the data is inside this volume <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 867.53 873.24 <NA> and in just a second here you will see okay here motts now move your left foot <unk> <unk> so he 's going like this
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 872.99 879.1 <NA> for twenty seconds he 's going like that and all of a sudden it lights up up here <unk> so we 've got motor cortex activation up there
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 879.99 881.98 <NA> <unk> this is really really nice and
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 881.81 885.73 <NA> i think this is a great tool and connecting also with the previous talk here 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 885.73 896.2 <NA> this is something that we could use as a tool to to really understand how the neurons are working how the brain is working and we can do this with very very high visual quality and very fast resolution <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 896.82 901.15 <NA> now we 're also having a bit of fun at the center so this is a cat scan
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 900.72 904.97 <NA> computer aided tomography <unk> so this is a lion from
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 904.96 907.7 <NA> <unk> the local zoo outside of norrkoping in kolmarden
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 907.6 911.15 <NA> elsa <unk> so she came to the center and
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 910.81 917.21 <NA> they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner and then of course i get the whole data set from the lion <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 917.05 922.74 <NA> and i can do very nice images like this <unk> i can peel off the layer of the lion i can look inside of it 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 922.74 929.88 <NA> and we 've been experimenting with this and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology because there 's very
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 929.84 938.97 <NA> <unk> little known about the animal anatomy what 's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information <unk> we can scan all sorts of things all sorts of animals 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 939.02 941.85 <NA> the only problem is to fit it into the machine 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 942.32 944.01 <NA> so here 's a bear
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 943.82 949.92 <NA> it was kind of hard to get it in <unk> and the bear is a cuddly friendly animal <unk> 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 951.36 952.72 <NA> <unk> the nose of the bear
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 952.47 960.91 <NA> and you might want to cuddle this one until you change the functions and look at this so be aware of the bear <unk> so
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 960.91 962.72 <NA> with that i 'd like to
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 962.48 966.28 <NA> to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 966.12 975.64 <NA> it 's a huge effort that goes into doing this <unk> gathering the data and developing the algorithms <unk> writing all the software so some very talented people 
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 975.45 981.71 <NA> my motto is always i only hire people that are smarter than i am and most of these are smarter than i am so thank you very much
