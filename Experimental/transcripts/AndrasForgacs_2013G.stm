AndrasForgacs_2013G 1 AndrasForgacs_2013G 245.71 254.97 <NA> closer on the horizon now how do we do it to grow leather <unk> we begin by taking cells from

AndrasForgacs_2013G 1 AndrasForgacs_2013G 270.98 275.26 <NA> this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions
AndrasForgacs_2013G 1 AndrasForgacs_2013G 275.97 284.59 <NA> <unk> and we then coax these cells to produce collagen as they would naturally this collagen is the stuff between cells it 's natural connective tissue it
AndrasForgacs_2013G 1 AndrasForgacs_2013G 284.37 289.33 <NA> 's the extracellular matrix but in leather it 's the main building block <unk> 
AndrasForgacs_2013G 1 AndrasForgacs_2013G 289.29 300.06 <NA> and what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen and we spread them out to form sheets <unk> and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another like phyllo pastry 
AndrasForgacs_2013G 1 AndrasForgacs_2013G 300.06 303.7 <NA> to form thicker sheets which we then let mature <unk> 
AndrasForgacs_2013G 1 AndrasForgacs_2013G 303.69 304.97 <NA> and finally we take

AndrasForgacs_2013G 1 AndrasForgacs_2013G 306.67 312.89 <NA> and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process we create leather
