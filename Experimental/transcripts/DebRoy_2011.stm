DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 406.52 411.7 <NA> the relative length of the utterances and what we found was this curious phenomena

DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 425.04 436.59 <NA> <unk> lined up almost precisely with when each word was born word after word systematically so it appears that all three primary caregivers myself my wife and our nanny

DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 560.02 567.78 <NA> and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects
DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 567.32 574.9 <NA> when they 're learned so in other words the relationship between words and what they 're about in the world so here 's how

DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 591.66 600.14 <NA> and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water <unk> and what we 've done is use the word water to tag that moment that bit of activity
DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 600.13 609.35 <NA> <unk> and now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in <unk> 
DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 609.13 618.47 <NA> and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co occurred with an instance of water

DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 645.31 652.29 <NA> where the word bye occurs much more in a structured way so we 're using these structures to start predicting

DebRoy_2011 1 DebRoy_2011 891.6 899.84 <NA> and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content a very interesting structure becomes visible we call this a
