MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 83.17 89.06 <NA> <unk> now the idea that the world is going to get a better place may seem a little fanciful

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 105.5 112.74 <NA> because back in two thousand and one the un agreed another set of goals <unk> the millennium development goals 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 112.67 118.89 <NA> and the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people living in poverty

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 150.4 156.17 <NA> <unk> and doomsayers who say that the world can 't get better are simply wrong 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 157.21 163.1 <NA> so how did we achieve this success well a lot of it was because of economic growth

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 189.56 197.34 <NA> but that ain 't easy because the global goals aren 't just ambitious <unk> they 're also pretty complicated 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 197.12 199.87 <NA> over seventeen goals there are then one
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 201.75 208.82 <NA> <unk> and literally hundreds of indicators also <unk> while some of the goals are pretty specific

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 215.4 225.11 <NA> so to help us with this benchmarking <unk> i 'm going to use a tool called the social progress index what this does is measures all the stuff the global goals are trying
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 226.03 232.76 <NA> <unk> but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 232.45 237.98 <NA> the social progress index basically asks three fundamental questions about a society <unk>

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 264.02 272.76 <NA> the social progress index sums all this together using fifty two indicators to create an aggregate score on a scale of zero to one hundred 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 272.93 279.73 <NA> and what we find is that there 's a wide diversity of performance in the world today <unk> the highest performing country
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 279.78 286.93 <NA> <unk> norway <unk> scores eighty eight the lowest performing country <unk> central african republic scores thirty one 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 287.1 295.63 <NA> and we can add up all the countries together weighting for the different population sizes <unk> and that global score is sixty one 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 295.71 304.13 <NA> in concrete terms that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of cuba or kazakhstan today
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 305.19 311.72 <NA> that 's where we are today sixty one out of one hundred <unk> what do we have to get to to achieve the global goals <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 311.77 319.22 <NA> now the global goals are certainly ambitious <unk> but they 're not about turning the world into norway in just fifteen years <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 318.85 322.1 <NA> so having looked at the numbers my estimate is that a score of <unk>
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 323.19 325.2 <NA> would not only be a giant
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 327.44 330.66 <NA> <unk> it would also count as hitting the global goals target <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 330.92 335.7 <NA> so there 's our target seventy five out of one hundred can we get there well
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 335.72 339.1 <NA> the social progress index can help us calculate this 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 339.1 347.82 <NA> because as you might have noticed there are no economic indicators in there there 's no gdp or economic growth in the social progress index model <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 347.51 353.43 <NA> and what that lets us do is understand the relationship between economic growth

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 355.26 364.63 <NA> let me show you on this chart <unk> so here on the vertical axis <unk> i 've put social progress the stuff the global goals are trying to achieve higher is better and then
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 364.26 370.54 <NA> on the horizontal axis is gdp per capita further to the right means richer <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 370.23 374.96 <NA> and in there i 'm now going to put all the countries of the world each one represented
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 376.18 380.99 <NA> <unk> and on top of that i 'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 380.71 387.62 <NA> and what this tells us is that as we get richer social progress does tend to improve 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 387.58 396.53 <NA> however as we get richer <unk> each extra dollar of gdp is buying us less and less social progress <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 396.61 400.05 <NA> and now we can use this information to start building our
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 404.69 413.34 <NA> <unk> we have a social progress score of sixty one and a gdp per capita of $ fourteen thousand and the place we 're trying to get to remember <unk>
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 414.41 424.32 <NA> <unk> global goals target <unk> so here we are today $ fourteen thousand per capita gdp <unk> how rich are we going to be in two thousand and thirty that 's what we need to know next 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 423.98 425.02 <NA> well 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 425 435 <NA> <unk> the best forecast we can find comes from the us department of agriculture <unk> which forecasts three point one percent average global economic growth over the next fifteen years <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 435 438.13 <NA> which means that in two thousand and thirty <unk> if they 're right

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 442.74 448.39 <NA> so now the question is if we get that much richer <unk> how much social progress are we going to get <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 448.23 454.37 <NA> well <unk> we asked a team of economists at deloitte who checked and crunched the numbers <unk> and they came back and
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 454.99 456.12 <NA> <unk> if the world

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 487.7 499.35 <NA> well i think there are two things <unk> the first is that in a way we 're the victims of our own success <unk> we 've used up the easy wins from economic growth and now we 're moving on to harder problems <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 500.16 508.69 <NA> <unk> we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits there are costs to the environment costs from new health problems like obesity 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 509.31 515.44 <NA> so that 's the bad news we 're not going to get to the global goals just by getting richer <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 515.73 518.14 <NA> so are the pessimists right 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 518.1 524.23 <NA> well maybe not because the social progress index also has some very good news <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 524.19 529.97 <NA> let me take you back to that regression line so this is the average relationship between gdp and social progress

MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 540.16 546.29 <NA> that tells us quite simply is that gdp is not destiny <unk> 
MichaelGreen_2015G 1 MichaelGreen_2015G 546.13 550.08 <NA> we have countries that are underperforming on social progress
