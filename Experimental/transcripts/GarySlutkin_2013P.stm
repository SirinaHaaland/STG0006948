GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 204.96 213.31 <NA> <unk> one was punishment <unk> and this i had heard about before <unk> we who had worked in behavior knew that punishment
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 213.14 221.71 <NA> was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued it was not a main driver of behavior nor was it a main
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 221.71 224.93 <NA> driver of behavior change and besides
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 225.16 226.55 <NA> <unk> it reminded me
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 226.32 235.55 <NA> of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science hadn 't been there before epidemics
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 235.35 239.6 <NA> of plague or typhus or leprosy

GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 246.17 251.81 <NA> and widows were dragged around the moat and dungeons were part of the solution 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 251.71 253.5 <NA> the other explanation or
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 254.63 263.91 <NA> <unk> solution suggested is please fix all of these things <unk> the schools the community the homes the families everything <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 263.54 268.11 <NA> and i 'd heard this before as well i 'd called this the everything theory <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 268.1 279.97 <NA> or eoe everything on earth <unk> but we 'd also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you don 't need to treat everything and so the
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 279.98 284.47 <NA> the sense that i had was there was a giant gap here <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 284.04 295.88 <NA> the problem of violence was stuck <unk> and this has historically been the case in many other issues diarrheal diseases had been stuck malaria had been stuck <unk> frequently a strategy has to be rethought 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 295.88 304.7 <NA> it 's not as if i had any idea what it would look like <unk> but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 304.87 314.79 <NA> <unk> and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education <unk> but i began to ask questions and search out
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 314.61 322.4 <NA> the usual things that i had been exploring before like what do the maps look like what do the graphs look like what does the data look like <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 322 329.94 <NA> and the maps of violence in most u s cities looked like this there was clustering
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 330.2 337.5 <NA> this reminded me of clustering that we 'd seen also in infectious epidemics for example cholera <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 337.49 340.08 <NA> and then we looked at the maps and
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 339.77 349.66 <NA> the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics and it also looked like
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 351.69 362.28 <NA> <unk> and then we asked the question <unk> well what really predicts a case of violence <unk> and it turns out that the greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 362.29 374.12 <NA> which also sounds like if there is a case of flu someone gave someone a case of flu or a cold or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 373.9 379.7 <NA> and so we see that violence is in a way <unk> behaving like a contagious disease
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 379.8 386.86 <NA> 're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 386.7 394.19 <NA> from fights or in gang wars or in civil wars or even in genocides <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 393.91 404.7 <NA> and so there 's good news about this though because there 's a way to reverse epidemics and there 's really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics <unk> and the first of it is interrupting
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 404.66 418.98 <NA> <unk> transmission <unk> in order to interrupt transmission you need to detect and find first cases <unk> in other words <unk> for t b you have to find somebody who has active t b who is infecting other people make sense <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 418.64 424.78 <NA> and there 's special workers for doing that for this particular problem we designed a new category of
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 425.55 440.3 <NA> <unk> like a sars worker or someone looking for bird flu <unk> might find first cases <unk> in this case it 's someone who 's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money and you can find workers and train them into these specialized
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 440.06 448.51 <NA> categories <unk> and the second thing to do of course is to prevent further spread that means to find who else has been exposed 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 448.51 454.94 <NA> but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of t b or someone who is just hanging
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 454.9 464.94 <NA> <unk> out in the neighborhoods but in the same group <unk> and then they need to be in a way <unk> managed as well <unk> particular to the specific disease process <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 464.76 467.97 <NA> and then the third part the shifting the norms <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 467.97 479.94 <NA> and that means a whole bunch of community activities <unk> remodeling public education <unk> and then you 've got what you might call group immunity <unk> and that combination of factors is how the aids
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 479.9 483.56 <NA> <unk> epidemic in uganda was very successfully reversed <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 483.56 493.72 <NA> and so what we decided to do in the year two thousand is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers the first being violence interruptors 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 493.51 504.73 <NA> and then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the united states at the time so violence interruptors hired from the same group
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 504.75 515.14 <NA> <unk> credibility <unk> trust <unk> access just like the health workers in somalia <unk> but designed for a different category and trained in persuasion cooling people <unk>
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 515.04 524.96 <NA> <unk> down buying time <unk> reframing <unk> and then another category of worker <unk> the outreach workers to keep people in a way on therapy for six to
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 527.5 536.63 <NA> <unk> but the object is behavior change and then a bunch of community activities for changing norms <unk> now our first experiment of this resulted in a <unk>
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 537.67 543.23 <NA> <unk> 67 percent drop in shootings and killings in the west garfield neighborhood of chicago and this was
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 544.15 550.02 <NA> a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself first fifty or sixty days <unk> then ninety days
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 550.16 562.2 <NA> <unk> then there was unfortunately another shooting in another ninety days <unk> and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon they were using parks they weren 't using before <unk> the sun was out everybody was happy <unk> but of course <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 561.86 564.83 <NA> the funders said wait a second do it again 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 564.61 568.21 <NA> and so we had to then fortunately <unk> 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 568.21 575.02 <NA> get the funds to repeat this experience and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a 45 percent drop
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 575 588.19 <NA> <unk> in shootings and killings and since that time this has been replicated twenty times there have been independent evaluations supported by the justice department and by the cdc and performed by johns hopkins that have shown <unk>
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 591.23 598.69 <NA> reductions in shootings and killings using this new method <unk> in fact there have been three independent evaluations of this now 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 598.23 604.31 <NA> now we 've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this including being featured on the new york times

GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 617.62 629.67 <NA> because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it we got a lot of criticism a lot of opposition <unk> and a lot of opponents <unk> in other words what do you mean health problem

GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 662.19 664.21 <NA> additionally 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 664.47 672.43 <NA> there was still this problem and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems 
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 672.27 679.58 <NA> yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce hiv and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful

GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 682.06 692.3 <NA> so what 's actually happened is although there is still some opposition <unk> the movement is clearly growing many of the major cities in the u s including new york <unk>

GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 717.5 722.97 <NA> where there 's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment where
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 722.97 729.88 <NA> there 's a 55 percent drop in the first neighborhood in puerto rico <unk> where interruptions are just beginning in honduras

GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 738.44 749.66 <NA> so violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease so the theory in a way is kind of being validated by the
GarySlutkin_2013P 1 GarySlutkin_2013P 752.02 761.75 <NA> <unk> the institute of medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data including the neuroscience on how this problem is really
