PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 12.49 24.87 <NA> <unk> i 've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 26.63 35.88 <NA> <unk> or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we 're coming across <unk> 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 35.48 42.82 <NA> and some of you may argue well don 't today 's cell phones do that already but i would say no 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 42.82 54.97 <NA> when you meet someone here at ted and this is the top networking place of course of the year you don 't shake somebody 's hand and then say can you hold on for a moment while i take out my phone and
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 54.93 56.98 <NA> <unk> google you or
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 56.75 64.45 <NA> when you go to the supermarket and you 're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 64.45 76.99 <NA> you don 't take out your cell phone and open a browser and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 76.59 79.91 <NA> so we don 't really have easy access to all
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 79.84 83.3 <NA> <unk> this relevant information that can just help us make
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 83.3 92.42 <NA> optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take and so my research group at the media lab has been
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 92.38 100.02 <NA> developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 100.25 108.06 <NA> <unk> without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior <unk> and i 'm here to unveil
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 107.99 115.14 <NA> our latest effort and most successful effort so far which is still very much a work in process i
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 114.68 118.17 <NA> 'm actually wearing the device right now and
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 117.83 120.96 <NA> we 've sort of cobbled it together with
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 120.56 128.41 <NA> components that are off the shelf and that by the way only cost three hundred and fifty dollars at this point in time
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 129.96 134.06 <NA> <unk> camera just a simple web cam a portable
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 135.21 143.72 <NA> <unk> battery powered projection system with a little mirror these components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 143.72 150.14 <NA> communication and computation device and in the video here we see my student pranav
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 150.7 155.64 <NA> <unk> who 's really the genius who 's been implementing and designing this whole system 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 155.46 166.43 <NA> and we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected <unk>
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 166.38 175.08 <NA> in front of him the system tracks the four significant fingers in this case he 's wearing simple marker
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 175 183.34 <NA> caps that you may recognize but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 183.34 188.86 <NA> and the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 188.5 197.61 <NA> any gestures that he 's making so he can just go to for example a map of long beach zoom in and out etc <unk> 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 197.27 204.97 <NA> the system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the take a picture gesture and then takes a picture of whatever
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 205.05 206.83 <NA> <unk> is in front of you
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 206.52 215.28 <NA> <unk> and when he then walks back to the media lab he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he 's taken 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 215.29 223.03 <NA> sort through them and organize them and re size them etc again using all natural gestures 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 222.54 224.69 <NA> so some of you
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 224.51 228.71 <NA> most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 229.96 234.57 <NA> <unk> jeff han or some of you may think well doesn 't this look like the microsoft surface table 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 234.57 241.05 <NA> and yes you also interact using natural gestures <unk> both hands etc <unk> 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 240.83 250.46 <NA> but the difference here is that you can use any surface you can walk up to any surface <unk> including your hand if nothing else is available <unk> 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 250.03 254.97 <NA> and interact with this projected data the device is completely
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 255.4 258.21 <NA> portable <unk> and can be applause ends
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 265.01 267.87 <NA> so one important difference is that it 's <unk>
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 267.77 279.18 <NA> <unk> totally mobile another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today 's cell phones and would actually not
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 279.93 284.2 <NA> <unk> bigger packaging could look a lot more stylish than this
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 284.07 287.23 <NA> version that i 'm wearing around my neck
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 287.31 296.89 <NA> <unk> but other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as tom cruise in minority report 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 297 300.94 <NA> the reason why we 're really excited about this device
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 300.45 302.62 <NA> is that it
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 302.16 304.34 <NA> really can act as one of these
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 304.8 306.6 <NA> sixth sense devices
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 306.42 312.85 <NA> that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you so
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 312.69 319.2 <NA> we see pranav here going into the supermarket and he 's shopping for some paper towels 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 319.2 329.97 <NA> and as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he 's picking up using either image recognition or marker technology <unk> and give him the green light
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 330.08 336.42 <NA> <unk> or an orange light he can ask for additional information so this particular
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 336.92 349.12 <NA> choice here is a particularly good choice given his personal criteria some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 352.71 360.91 <NA> <unk> if he picks up a book in the bookstore he can get an amazon rating it gets projected right on the cover of the book this is
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 360.74 366.58 <NA> juan 's book our previous speaker <unk> which gets a great rating by the way at amazon <unk> 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 366.58 375.17 <NA> and so pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book reader comments <unk> maybe
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 375.34 383.03 <NA> <unk> sort of information by his favorite critic etc <unk> if he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 382.86 390.92 <NA> by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 390.73 394.43 <NA> reading the newspaper it never has to be
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 394.15 404.1 <NA> outdated you can get video annotations of the events that you 're reading about you can get the latest sports scores
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 405.13 408.09 <NA> <unk> this is a more controversial one 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 408.86 418.87 <NA> as you interact with someone at ted <unk> maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags the words that are associated with that person
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 418.65 425.32 <NA> in their blog and personal web pages in this case the student is interested in cameras
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 426.66 435.22 <NA> <unk> on your way to the airport if you pick up your boarding pass it can tell you that your flight is delayed that the gate has changed etc <unk> 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 435.22 440.3 <NA> and if you need to know what the current time is it 's as simple as
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 440.09 441.88 <NA> drawing a watch 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 443.82 445.75 <NA> on your arm 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 447.09 454.97 <NA> so that 's where we 're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 454.93 461.42 <NA> <unk> us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across 
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 461.42 465.39 <NA> my student pranav who 's really like i said the genius behind
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 487.79 489.66 <NA> <unk> he does deserve
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 489.53 498.96 <NA> a lot of applause because i don 't think he 's slept much in the last three months actually <unk> and his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 499.34 504.52 <NA> <unk> but it 's not perfect yet it 's very much a work in progress <unk> and who knows
PattieMaes_2009 1 PattieMaes_2009 505.17 511.82 <NA> <unk> in another ten years we 'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant <unk> thank you
