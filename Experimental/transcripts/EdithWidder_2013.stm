EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 105.02 111.9 <NA> a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week 
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 113.45 124.6 <NA> i gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which i emphasized the importance of using quiet <unk> unobtrusive platforms for

EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 131.52 142.18 <NA> using these platforms and my impression that i saw more animals working from the submersible than i did with either of the <unk> remote operated vehicles 
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 141.75 154.85 <NA> but that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems so my suspicion was
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 154.81 164.9 <NA> <unk> that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make so i set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean and i had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 164.77 174.81 <NA> the johnson sea link which you can probably just barely hear here <unk> uses electric thrusters very very quiet <unk> the tiburon also uses

EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 191.18 198.69 <NA> so for the deep sea squid hunt i proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 198.9 199.9 <NA> with
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 205.68 218.38 <NA> <unk> and the only illumination coming from red light that 's invisible to most deep sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue that 's visible to our eye <unk> but it 's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea 
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 217.98 223.99 <NA> so this camera platform which we called the medusa could just be thrown off the back of the ship 
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 224.07 229.97 <NA> attached to a float at the surface with over two thousand feet of line it would just
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 229.96 237.65 <NA> <unk> float around passively carried by the currents <unk> and the only light visible to the animals in the deep
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 237.42 245.39 <NA> would be the blue light of the optical lure which we called the electronic jellyfish or e jelly 
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 244.96 253.67 <NA> because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish atolla 
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 253.39 254.97 <NA> now this
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 254.96 262.65 <NA> <unk> pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense 
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 262.16 275.61 <NA> the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish but it 's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it 's being chewed on by a predator
EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 275.18 279.76 <NA> and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a

EdithWidder_2013 1 EdithWidder_2013 356.01 365.01 <NA> <unk> what really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it which i think it mistook for the predator on the e jelly
