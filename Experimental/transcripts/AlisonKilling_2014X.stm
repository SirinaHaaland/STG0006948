AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 13.9 19.55 <NA> <unk> i have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 19.99 28.32 <NA> over the past ten years in the uk <unk> the return on burial plots has outperformed the uk property market by a ratio of around three to one
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 29.9 36.79 <NA> <unk> there are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors <unk> and they start at around three thousand nine hundred pounds <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 36.79 40.48 <NA> and they 're projected to achieve about forty percent growth <unk>
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 40.27 45.78 <NA> the biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 47.48 50.02 <NA> now this is a real proposition
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 50.58 57.61 <NA> <unk> there are companies out there that really are offering this investment but my interest in it is quite different 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 57.24 67.9 <NA> i 'm an architect and urban designer and for the past year and a half i 've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they 've shaped our cities and the buildings within them 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 68.01 74.99 <NA> so in the summer i did my first exhibition on death and architecture in venice <unk> and it was called
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 76.99 86.9 <NA> <unk> because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about the exhibition was designed to be quite playful <unk> so that people would literally engage with it <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 86.44 95.24 <NA> so one of our exhibits was an interactive map of london which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 95.24 99.81 <NA> as you wave your hand across the map <unk> the name of the piece of real estate the
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 100 103.71 <NA> building or the cemetery is revealed <unk> and
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 103.37 113.58 <NA> those white shapes that you can see they 're all of the hospitals and hospices and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city in fact the majority are cemeteries 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 113.15 117.46 <NA> we wanted to show that even though death and
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 117.13 123.57 <NA> burial are things that we might not think about they 're all around us <unk> and they 're important parts of our cities <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 123.56 129.97 <NA> so about half a million people die in the uk each year and of those around a quarter
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 129.96 133.59 <NA> <unk> will want to be buried <unk> but the uk like
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 133.37 139.45 <NA> many western european countries is running out of burial space <unk> especially in the major cities 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 139.17 150.2 <NA> and the greater london authority has been aware of this for a while <unk> and the main causes are population growth <unk> the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full there 's a custom
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 150 161.6 <NA> custom in the uk that graves are considered to be occupied forever <unk> and there 's also development pressure people want to use that same land to build houses or offices or shops <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 161.44 174.96 <NA> so they came up with a few solutions they were like well <unk> maybe we can reuse those graves after fifty years or maybe we can bury people like four deep so that four people can be buried in the same plot and we can make more efficient use of the land
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 176.06 180.63 <NA> <unk> that way hopefully london will still have space to bury people in the near future 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 180.62 185.38 <NA> but traditionally cemeteries haven 't been taken care of by the local authority 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 185.38 192.48 <NA> in fact the surprising thing is that there 's no legal obligation on anyone in the uk to provide burial space <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 192.02 200.08 <NA> traditionally it 's been done by private and religious organizations like churches and mosques and synagogues
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 201.33 206.31 <NA> <unk> there 's also occasionally been a for profit group who has wanted to get in on the act <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 206.32 214.48 <NA> and you know they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost and it looks like there 's serious money to be made <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 214.11 219.5 <NA> so actually <unk> if you want to go out and start your own cemetery you kind of can 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 219.5 229.22 <NA> there was this couple in south wales <unk> and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it and they wanted to develop the land they had a load of ideas they
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 229.93 237.77 <NA> <unk> thought about making a caravan park but the council said no and then they wanted to make a fish farm and again the council said no
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 237.28 240.45 <NA> then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 240.23 249.48 <NA> and they calculated that by doing this they could increase the value of their land from about ninety five thousand pounds to over one million pounds <unk>
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 251.54 258 <NA> <unk> just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries like it 's kind of ludicrous <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 257.75 263.68 <NA> right the thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 263.44 276.06 <NA> they look like they 're expensive but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot like <unk> someone has to cut the grass for the next fifty years that means it 's very difficult to make money from cemeteries <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 276.06 279.58 <NA> and it 's the reason that normally they 're run by the council or by a
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 279.89 285.67 <NA> not for profit group but anyway the council granted these people permission and they 're now trying to build their cemetery <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 285.78 293.68 <NA> so just to explain to you kind of how this works if i want to build something in the uk <unk> like a cemetery for example <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 293.67 303.38 <NA> then i have to apply for planning permission first so if i want to build a a new office building for a client or if i want to extend my home
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 303.22 304.97 <NA> or you know if i have a shop
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 305.16 311.18 <NA> and i want to convert it into an office i have to do a load of drawings and i submit them to the council for permission <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 310.69 321.08 <NA> and they 'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings so they 'll look at what it looks like <unk> but they 'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on <unk>
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 320.98 329.76 <NA> <unk> the local environment and they 'll be thinking about things like <unk> is this thing going to cause pollution or is there going to be a lot of traffic that wants to go to this thing that
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 329.84 337.65 <NA> <unk> built <unk> but also good things is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 337.7 342.45 <NA> and they 'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages and they 'll make a decision <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 342.41 347.13 <NA> so that 's how it works if i want to build a large cemetery <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 347.12 352.66 <NA> but what if i 've got a piece of land and i just want to bury a few people like five or six
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 354.78 357.58 <NA> <unk> actually i don 't need permission from anyone 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 357.33 368.95 <NA> there 's actually almost no regulation in the uk around burial and the little bit that there is is about not polluting water courses like not polluting rivers or groundwater <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 368.46 372.97 <NA> so actually if you want to go and make your own mini cemetery then you can 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 372.78 375.02 <NA> but i mean like really who
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 378.79 386.36 <NA> <unk> if you 're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate then there 's a chance that you 'll have a mausoleum on it and you 'll bury your family there 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 386.23 394.71 <NA> but the really weird thing is that you don 't need to have a piece of land of a certain size before you 're allowed to start burying people on it 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 394.71 399.87 <NA> and so that means that technically this applies to like the back garden of your house in the
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 403.82 411.81 <NA> <unk> what if you wanted to try this yourself at home <unk> well there 's a few councils that have guidance on their website which can help you 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 411.41 417.79 <NA> so the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 417.63 422.16 <NA> you 're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 423.74 429.97 <NA> they also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is but that 's pretty much it for formal requirements
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 430.31 438.42 <NA> now they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this but legally speaking there 's almost nothing that they can do about it and
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 438.26 447.32 <NA> just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 447.32 449.84 <NA> they also warn that it might cause the value of your
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 453.49 457.43 <NA> <unk> it 's more likely that no one will want to buy your house at all after that 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 457.84 465.98 <NA> so what i find fascinating about this is the the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 465.76 474.9 <NA> in the uk and i think that the figures across europe are probably similar <unk> only about thirty percent of people have ever talked to anyone about their wishes around
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 478.28 486.73 <NA> <unk> percent of people have ever talked about this and the reasons that people give <unk> you know <unk> they think that their death is far off or
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 486.52 495.75 <NA> they think that they 're going to make people uncomfortable by talking about it and you know to a certain extent <unk> there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us <unk> 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 495.74 504.97 <NA> the government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death for example <unk> and there 's people like funeral directors who devote their entire working lives
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 504.99 510.68 <NA> <unk> to this issue <unk> but when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities 
AlisonKilling_2014X 1 AlisonKilling_2014X 510.44 523.36 <NA> there 's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine so we 're not thinking about this but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it they 're not taking care of it either <unk>
