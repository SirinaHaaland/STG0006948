MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 160.54 169.64 <NA> to actually fix a problem in front of me <unk> and it just didn 't come out that way so i i couldn 't handle it i changed my dosages but that
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 169.15 177.88 <NA> experience i think gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through and i 've gotten along with men a a lot better since then

MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 179.78 184.21 <NA> <unk> with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 184.03 189.96 <NA> was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 189.89 198.6 <NA> my creative thought my idea flow <unk> and i think mostly in images and so for me that became a key metric
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 198.14 204.88 <NA> how to get these mental images that i use as a way of rapid prototyping if you will my ideas
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 204.92 215.05 <NA> trying on different new ideas for size playing out scenarios this kind of thinking isn 't new philiosophers like hume and descartes and hobbes saw things <unk>
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 214.95 221.11 <NA> <unk> similarly <unk> they thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 229.87 234.8 <NA> <unk> most of us are central in inventive and creative thinking <unk> 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 234.37 246.86 <NA> so after several years i tuned myself up and i have lots of great really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them and so now i 'm working on 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 246.86 253.91 <NA> how can i get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 253.54 254.97 <NA> can you imagine
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 255.13 261.96 <NA> if you will a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her

MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 265.13 274.9 <NA> there are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed <unk> and the truth is the remaining bottleneck in being able to
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 275 279.04 <NA> do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 279.04 286.93 <NA> so let me show you why i think we 're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups <unk> 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 286.74 288.02 <NA> both used
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 289.04 298.63 <NA> technology functional magnetic resonance imaging technology to image the brain and here is a brain scan set from giorgio ganis and his colleagues at harvard 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 298.63 304.46 <NA> and the left hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image

MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 311.26 319.79 <NA> and the right column was created by subtracting the middle column from the left column showing the difference to be nearly zero 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 319.75 324.75 <NA> this was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 325.85 333.72 <NA> <unk> always with a similar result the difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing <unk> 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 333.71 340.86 <NA> next let me share with you one other experiment this from jack gallant 's lab at cal berkeley <unk> 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 341.06 353.8 <NA> they 've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields <unk> so let me set this up for you in this experiment individuals were shown hundreds of hours of youtube videos while scans were made of their brains
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 353.62 354.97 <NA> to create a large
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 355.1 358.99 <NA> library of their brain reacting to video sequences 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 359.13 366.82 <NA> then a new movie was shown with new images new people new animals in it and a new scan set was recorded 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 366.54 374.03 <NA> the computer using brain scan data alone decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 373.87 374.9 <NA> the individual was
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 377.65 384.14 <NA> <unk> you see the computer 's guess and on the left hand side the presented clip <unk> this is the <unk>
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 385.6 391.22 <NA> we are so close to being able to do this we just need to up the resolution 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 391.12 399.35 <NA> and now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image it creates the same brain scan 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 403.07 410.49 <NA> <unk> brain scan systems available today and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 410.21 415.03 <NA> next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 414.64 417.09 <NA> to get a deeper glimpse 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 416.6 425.08 <NA> how do we do that there 's a lot of techniques in this approach <unk> one way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes <unk> i 'm not for that
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 425.64 433.04 <NA> <unk> there 's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed some even by me but given the recent success of mri 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 433.04 437.98 <NA> first we need to ask the question is it the end of the road with this technology <unk> 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 437.55 449.9 <NA> conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets <unk> but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements not the thousandfold we
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 450.88 456.96 <NA> <unk> i 'm putting forward an idea <unk> instead of bigger magnets let 's make better magnets <unk> 
MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 456.72 467.09 <NA> there 's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets <unk> and with these magnets we <unk>

MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 480.75 491.43 <NA> as is shown here by shifting things we can create much more complicated structures with with slightly different arrangements kind of like making spirograph

MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 501.72 506.66 <NA> <unk> but yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from

MaryJepsen_2013 1 MaryJepsen_2013 515.94 523.93 <NA> let 's also instead of a uniform magnetic field put down structured magnetic patterns in addition
