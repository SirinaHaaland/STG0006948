JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 62.13 68.23 <NA> and everything about wikipedia is managed by virtually an all volunteer staff so
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 67.89 74 <NA> when yochai is talking about new methods of organization he 's exactly describing wikipedia 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 74 78.07 <NA> and what i 'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 77.61 78.98 <NA> on the inside
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 79.9 89.67 <NA> <unk> so wikipedia 's owned by the wikimedia foundation which i founded a nonprofit organization and our goal the core aim of the wikimedia foundation 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 89.67 100.08 <NA> is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet and so if you think about what that means it means a lot more than just building a cool website we 're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 109.04 121.65 <NA> that goes beyond just the internet and so that 's a big part of why we 've chosen the free licensing model <unk> because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to they can take our content and do anything they like with it you can copy it redistribute it and
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 121.67 128.37 <NA> you can do it commercially or non commercially so there 's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around wikipedia

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 194.54 203.41 <NA> and what 's interesting about this is the new york times website is a huge enormous corporate operation with i have no idea how many hundreds of employees 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 203.41 204.97 <NA> we have exactly one employee

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 260.96 267.27 <NA> so we 're doing around one point four billion page views monthly so it 's really gotten to be a huge thing 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 266.9 275.85 <NA> and everything is managed by the volunteers and the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about five thousand dollars <unk> and that 's essentially our main cost

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 288.48 295.79 <NA> so the big question when you 've got this really chaotic organization is <unk> why isn 't it all rubbish why is the website as good as it is <unk> 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 295.79 300.02 <NA> first of all how good is it well it 's pretty good it isn 't perfect but it 's
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 300.22 306.95 <NA> <unk> much better than you would expect given our completely chaotic model so when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 310.3 313.89 <NA> but when we 've seen quality tests and there haven 't been enough of these
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 313.44 316.76 <NA> yet and i 'm really encouraging people to do more 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 316.63 324.9 <NA> comparing wikipedia to traditional things we we win hands down so a german magazine compared german wikipedia which is
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 325.67 331.35 <NA> <unk> much smaller than english to microsoft encarta and to brockhaus <unk> multimedial 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 330.92 336.94 <NA> and we won across the board they hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality <unk> and
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 336.58 339.03 <NA> we were very pleased with that result <unk> 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 338.81 344.67 <NA> so a lot of people have heard about the wikipedia bush kerry controversy 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 344.36 350.08 <NA> the media has covered this somewhat extensively it started out with an article in red herring
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 350.34 354.94 <NA> <unk> the reporters called me up and they i mean i have to say they spelled my name right
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 354.72 362.41 <NA> but they they really wanted to say the bush kerry election is so contentious it 's tearing apart the wikipedia community 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 362.41 370.37 <NA> and so they quote me as saying they 're the most contentious in the history of wikipedia what i actually said is they 're not contentious at all <unk> so it 's
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 370.18 375.02 <NA> a slight misquote the articles were edited quite
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 375.55 381.77 <NA> <unk> and it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions time magazine recently reported that 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 381.34 388.73 <NA> extreme action sometimes has to be taken and wales locked the entries on kerry and bush for most of two thousand and four 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 388.33 391.65 <NA> this came after i told the reporter that we
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 391.32 392.93 <NA> had to lock it for
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 392.76 394.95 <NA> occasionally a little bit here and there <unk> 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 394.95 403.17 <NA> so the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the wikipedia community are not really controversies at all
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 404.99 413.97 <NA> <unk> on controversial topics are edited a lot but they don 't cause much controversy within the community <unk> and the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 418.42 424.78 <NA> the real struggle is not between the right and the left that 's where most people assume but it 's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 426.15 434.54 <NA> <unk> no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities <unk> the actual truth about the specific bush kerry incident is that the
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 435.77 442.12 <NA> articles were locked less than one percent of the time in two thousand and four <unk> and it wasn 't because they were contentious it was just because
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 441.81 447.43 <NA> there was routine vandalism which happens sometimes even on stage 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 448.14 454.52 <NA> sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly and i said
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 455.05 457.32 <NA> <unk> say please don 't do that that 's not
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 457.14 464.69 <NA> a good thing <unk> so how do we do this how do we manage the quality control how does it work
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 465.13 469.76 <NA> <unk> so there 's a few elements <unk> mostly social policies
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 469.27 474.9 <NA> and some elements of the software so the the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 475.28 481.98 <NA> <unk> this is something that i set down from the very beginning as a core principle of the community that 's completely not debatable
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 482.03 491.55 <NA> it 's a social concept of cooperation <unk> so we don 't talk a lot about truth and objectivity the reason for this is if we say we 're only going <unk>
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 491.45 498.55 <NA> <unk> to write the truth about some topic that doesn 't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write because i don 't agree with you about what 's the truth 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 505.07 515.41 <NA> any time there 's a controversial issue wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue <unk> we should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it so this neutrality policy <unk>
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 515.36 522.08 <NA> is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done <unk> 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 525.76 527.39 <NA> <unk> cultural backgrounds 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 527.11 537.5 <NA> by having this firm neutrality policy which is non negotiable from the beginning we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don 't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right <unk>
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 537.45 541.67 <NA> if you engage in that type of behavior you 'll be asked to leave the community
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 542.77 550.02 <NA> <unk> so real time peer review every single change on the site goes to the recent changes page so as soon as he made his change it went
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 551.36 559.5 <NA> <unk> that recent changes page was also fed into an irc channel which is an internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 560.42 566.01 <NA> and people can get rss feeds they can get email notifications of changes
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 566.03 574.5 <NA> and then users can set up their own personal watch list so my page is on quite a few volunteers ' watch lists because it is sometimes vandalized and
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 575.34 580.66 <NA> <unk> what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly <unk> and then
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 580.17 592.78 <NA> they 'll just simply revert the change there 's a new pages feed for example so you can go to a certain page of wikipedia and see every new page as it 's created this is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted <unk>
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 594.08 603.38 <NA> but also that 's some of the most interesting and fun things some of the new articles people will start an article on some interesting topic other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 603.38 604.4 <NA> make it much better
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 605.47 611.15 <NA> <unk> so we do have edits by anonymous users which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia <unk> 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 610.98 621.47 <NA> so <unk> chris was able to do his change he didn 't have to log in or anything he just went on the website and made a change but it turns out that only about eighteen percent of all the edits to the website are done <unk>

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 630.05 636.19 <NA> <unk> of maybe six hundred to one thousand people who are in constant communication and we have over forty irc channels forty mailing lists

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 645.56 654.91 <NA> <unk> what they 're doing the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality we don 't always meet those standards but that
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 654.96 664.66 <NA> <unk> we 're striving for and so that tight community is who really cares for the site and these are some of the smartest people i 've ever met it 's my job to say that but it 's actually true 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 664.17 668.51 <NA> the type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 668.33 675.11 <NA> tend to be pretty smart people the tools and the software there 's lots of tools that allow us allow us meaning the community

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 678.66 688.79 <NA> on flat earth and you can see some changes that were made what 's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see ok i understand now when somebody goes and looks at
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 688.79 699.59 <NA> they see that someone an anonymous ip number made an edit to my page that sounds suspicious who is this person somebody looks at it they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 701.63 708.36 <NA> <unk> these words have changed things like this so that 's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page <unk> 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 708.02 713.94 <NA> another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open ended 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 713.75 725.05 <NA> most of the social rules and the and the methods of work are left completely open ended in the software all of that stuff is just on wiki pages and so there 's nothing in the software that enforces the rules 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 725.05 728.14 <NA> the example i 've got up here is the votes for deletion page
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 731.88 746.89 <NA> <unk> it needs to be deleted cases like that the administrators just delete it there 's no reason to have a big argument about it but you can imagine there 's a lot of other areas where the question is is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia is the information verifiable is it a hoax is it true is it what 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 746.7 749.87 <NA> so we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 750.16 754.56 <NA> <unk> and so the method that arose organically within the community is the votes for deletion page

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 761.58 770.21 <NA> it fails the google test miserably the google test is you look in google and see if it 's there because if something 's not even in google it probably doesn 't exist at all it
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 769.78 774.77 <NA> 's not a perfect rule <unk> but it 's a nice starting point for quick research <unk>

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 789.77 799.69 <NA> and what 's interesting about this is that the software is these votes are just text typed into a page this is not really a vote so much as it is a
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 800.64 803.05 <NA> <unk> now it is true that at the end of the day 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 802.95 811.58 <NA> an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say ok <unk> eighteen deletes two keeps we 'll delete it but in other cases <unk> this could be
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 811.22 822.77 <NA> eighteen deletes and two keeps and we would keep it because if those last two keeps say wait a minute nobody else saw this but i found it in a book and i found a link to a page that describes it and i 'm going to clean it up tomorrow so please don 't delete

JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 906.42 916.24 <NA> embarrass her because i say well angela for example could get away with doing absolutely anything within wikipedia <unk> because she 's so admired and so powerful but the irony is of course that
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 916.08 925.55 <NA> angela can do this because she 's the one person who you know would never ever break any rules of wikipedia and i also like to say she 's the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia so 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 926.38 929.28 <NA> and then there 's monarchy and that 's my role on the community
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 930.53 934.12 <NA> laughter i was describing this in
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 933.94 943.5 <NA> in berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said i am the queen of england and that 's not exactly what i said but 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 944.24 945.97 <NA> the point is
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 945.81 950.08 <NA> my role in the community within the free software world there
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 955.26 961.9 <NA> <unk> so if you look at most of the major free software projects they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 961.47 963.16 <NA> benevolent dictator well
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 963.16 971.74 <NA> i don 't like the term benevolent dictator and i don 't think that it 's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 971.28 974.81 <NA> the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world it just isn 't
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 976.12 985.16 <NA> <unk> but there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy a certain amount of sometimes we have to make a decision and we don 't want to get bogged down too heavily in
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 985.03 989.39 <NA> formal decision making processes so as an example of <unk>
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 991.03 999.81 <NA> <unk> how this can be important we recently had a situation where a neo nazi website discovered wikipedia and they said oh well this is horrible this jewish
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1000 1006.77 <NA> conspiracy of a website and we 're going to get certain articles deleted that we don 't like and we see they have a voting process so we 're going to send
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1006.37 1010.04 <NA> we have forty thousand members and we 're going to send them over
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1009.64 1017.18 <NA> and they 're all going to vote and get these pages deleted well they managed to get eighteen people to show up that 's neo nazi math for you 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1017.41 1021.38 <NA> they always think they 've got forty thousand members when they 've got eighteen but
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1020.92 1025.08 <NA> they they managed to get eighteen people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1025.04 1035.22 <NA> <unk> delete a perfectly valid article of course the vote ended up being about eighty five to eighteen so there was no real danger to our democratic processes on the other hand people said 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1034.73 1041.61 <NA> but what are we going to do i mean this could happen what if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1042.4 1054.82 <NA> then i said well fuck it we 'll just change the rules that 's my job in the community to say we won 't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content and so as long as people
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1054.78 1065.86 <NA> <unk> trust me in my role then that 's a valid place for me of course because of the free licensing if i do a bad job the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave i can 't tell anyone what to do 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1065.52 1075.13 <NA> so the final point here is that to understand how wikipedia works it 's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work but we are not
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1074.88 1079.97 <NA> fanatical web anarchists in fact we 're very flexible about the
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1079.9 1085.43 <NA> <unk> social methodology because ultimately the passion of the community is for the quality of the work 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1085 1089.36 <NA> not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it <unk> thank you 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1093.97 1096.77 <NA> applause ben saunders yeah hi ben saunders jimmy you mentioned
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1096.28 1101.69 <NA> impartiality being a key to wikipedia 's success it strikes me that
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1101.98 1104.7 <NA> much of the textbooks that are used
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1104.9 1109.71 <NA> <unk> our children are inherently biased have you found wikipedia being used
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1109.64 1116.73 <NA> by teachers and how do you see wikipedia changing education jimmy wales yeah so a lot of teachers are beginning to use wikipedia
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1116.45 1120.03 <NA> there 's a media storyline
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1119.57 1125.38 <NA> about wikipedia which i think is false it builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1125.58 1132.1 <NA> <unk> and the storyline is there 's this crazy thing wikipedia but academics hate it and teachers hate it 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1131.9 1134.7 <NA> and that turns out to not be true <unk> 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1134.71 1143.12 <NA> the last time i got an email from a journalist saying why do academics hate wikipedia i sent it from my harvard email address because i was recently appointed a fellow there and i said well <unk> 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1142.9 1144.94 <NA> they don 't all hate it 
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1146.01 1154.85 <NA> but i think there 's going to be huge impacts and we actually have a project that i 'm personally really excited about which is the wikibooks project which is an effort to
JimmyWales_2005G 1 JimmyWales_2005G 1154.78 1162.63 <NA> <unk> create textbooks in all the languages and that 's a much bigger project it 's going to take twenty years or so to come to fruition
