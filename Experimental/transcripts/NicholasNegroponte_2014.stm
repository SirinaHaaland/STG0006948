NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 801.87 811.18 <NA> <unk> i became more involved with computers and learning and influenced by seymour but particularly looking at learning
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 810.75 816.26 <NA> as something that is best approximated by computer programming <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 816.26 829.01 <NA> when you write a computer program <unk> you 've got to not just list things out and sort of take an algorithm and translate it into a set of instructions but when there 's a bug and all programs have bugs <unk> you 've got to

NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 841.09 850.82 <NA> so that led to my own work with seymour in places like cambodia and the starting of one laptop per child 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 850.45 854.76 <NA> enough ted talks on one laptop per child so i 'll go through it very fast
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 855.05 862.54 <NA> <unk> but it did it did give us the chance to do something at a relatively large scale

NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 866.47 878.02 <NA> very few people know that one laptop per child was a $ one billion project <unk> and it was at least over the seven years i ran it but even more important the world bank contributed zero
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 879.93 892.69 <NA> <unk> it was mostly the countries using their own treasuries which is very interesting at least to me it was very interesting in terms of what i plan to do next <unk> so these are the various places it happened 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 892.47 899.68 <NA> i then tried an experiment <unk> and the experiment happened in ethiopia <unk>

NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 905.1 913.28 <NA> learning happen where there are no schools and we dropped off tablets with no instructions
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 913.18 922.37 <NA> and let the children figure it out and in a short period of time they not only
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 922.12 927.87 <NA> turned them on and were using fifty apps per child within five days they were singing
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 929.95 932.22 <NA> but they hacked android
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 931.97 941.28 <NA> within six months <unk> and so that seemed sufficiently interesting this is perhaps the best picture i have the kid
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 940.79 950.17 <NA> on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher look at the kid on the left and so on there are no
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 950.04 957.79 <NA> <unk> no adults involved in this at all so i said well can we do this at a larger scale and what is it that 's missing the

NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 980.67 984.08 <NA> is very different than connecting the next billion <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 983.98 992.45 <NA> and the reason it 's different is that the next billion are sort of low hanging fruit <unk> but the last billion are rural

NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1046.55 1054.97 <NA> but there are a lot of reasons why they are and for two billion dollars you can connect a lot more than one
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1054.93 1064.93 <NA> <unk> hundred million people <unk> but the reason i picked two <unk> and i will leave this as my last slide is two billion dollars
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1064.77 1067.45 <NA> is what we were spending
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1067.05 1074.56 <NA> in afghanistan every week <unk> so surely if we can connect
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1074.07 1079.61 <NA> africa and the last billion people for numbers like that we should be doing
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1079.93 1081.18 <NA> thank you very much
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1106.06 1111.55 <NA> and my prediction and this is a prediction because it 'll be thirty years i won 't be here <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1111.55 1116.34 <NA> but one of the things about learning how to read <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1116.27 1124.83 <NA> we have been doing a lot of consuming of information going through our eyes and so that may be a very inefficient channel 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1124.52 1129.1 <NA> so my prediction is that we are going to ingest
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1128.79 1129.79 <NA> information
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1129.8 1132.82 <NA> you 're going to swallow a pill and know english <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1132.54 1138.09 <NA> you 're going to swallow a pill and know shakespeare <unk> and the way to do it is through the bloodstream <unk> 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1137.87 1145.81 <NA> so once it 's in your bloodstream it basically goes through it and gets into the brain and when it knows that it 's in the brain in the different pieces 
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1145.81 1151.85 <NA> it deposits it in the right places <unk> so it 's ingesting ca have you been hanging out with ray kurzweil
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1154.9 1163.76 <NA> <unk> boyden and hanging around with one of the speakers who is here hugh herr <unk> and there are a number of people this isn 't quite as far fetched so
NicholasNegroponte_2014 1 NicholasNegroponte_2014 1163.27 1172.16 <NA> thirty years from now ca we will check it out we 're going to be back and we 're going to play this clip thirty years from now <unk> and then all eat the red pill <unk>
