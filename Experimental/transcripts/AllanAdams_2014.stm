AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 16 25.08 <NA> you see stars and if you look further you see more stars <unk> and further galaxies and further more galaxies but if you keep looking
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 24.92 28.25 <NA> further and further <unk> eventually you see nothing

AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 29.93 37.2 <NA> <unk> and then finally you see a faint fading afterglow <unk> and it 's the afterglow of the big bang <unk> 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 36.92 48.75 <NA> now the big bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small incredibly hot incredibly roiling mass <unk> 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 48.41 51.27 <NA> and from it sprung everything we see 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 51.35 53.26 <NA> now we 've mapped
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 53.03 54.91 <NA> that afterglow with
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 54.84 65.08 <NA> <unk> great precision <unk> and when i say we i mean people who aren 't me we 've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision and one of the shocks about it is that it 's almost completely <unk>
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 65.03 75.08 <NA> uniform fourteen billion light years that way and fourteen billion light years that way it 's the same temperature now it 's been fourteen billion years since
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 76.24 85.74 <NA> <unk> and so it 's got faint and cold it 's now two point seven degrees <unk> but it 's not exactly two point seven degrees it 's only two point seven degrees to about
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 85.56 90.38 <NA> ten parts in a million <unk> over here it 's a little hotter and over there it 's a little cooler <unk> 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 89.89 100.08 <NA> and that 's incredibly important to everyone in this room because where it was a little hotter there was a little more stuff <unk> and where there was a little more stuff we have galaxies and clusters
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 101.6 106.62 <NA> <unk> and all the structure you see in the cosmos <unk> and those small little <unk>
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 107.65 109.98 <NA> twenty parts in a million <unk> 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 109.64 122.15 <NA> those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos <unk> that is spectacular <unk> and that 's not what they found on monday what they found on monday is cooler <unk> 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 122.15 124.66 <NA> so here 's what they found on monday <unk> 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 127.02 136.48 <NA> <unk> you take a bell and you whack the bell with a hammer what happens it rings but if you wait that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don 't notice it anymore 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 136.32 145.55 <NA> now that early universe was incredibly dense like a metal way denser <unk> and if you hit it it would ring <unk> but the thing ringing
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 145.38 149.72 <NA> would be the structure of space time itself <unk> and the hammer would be quantum
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 150.73 152.72 <NA> <unk> what they found on monday
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 152.49 162.59 <NA> was evidence of the ringing of the space time of the early universe what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era <unk> and here 's how they found it 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 162.58 171.03 <NA> those waves have long since faded if you go for a walk you don 't wiggle <unk> those gravitational waves in the structure of space
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 170.82 179.97 <NA> are totally invisible for all practical purposes but early on when the universe was making that last afterglow the gravitational waves
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 180.31 184.56 <NA> put little twists in the structure of the light that we see
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 184.56 195.52 <NA> <unk> so by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper in fact these guys spent three years on the south pole looking straight up through the coldest clearest <unk> cleanest air they possibly could find
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 195.28 204.97 <NA> looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol the signal of gravitational waves
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 204.72 207.67 <NA> <unk> waves the ringing of the early universe <unk> 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 207.3 211.12 <NA> and on monday they announced that they had found it <unk> 
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 210.63 221.08 <NA> and the thing that 's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing though that is awesome the thing that 's totally amazing the reason i 'm on this stage is because what that tells us <unk>
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 221.03 229.91 <NA> is something deep about the early universe it tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble and this is the
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 229.84 240.02 <NA> <unk> idea of inflation one large bubble surrounded by something else this isn 't conclusive evidence for inflation but anything that isn 't inflation that explains this will look the <unk>
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 239.92 247.14 <NA> <unk> same this is a theory an idea that has been around for a while and we never thought we we 'd really see it for good reasons we thought we 'd never see
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 250 259.14 <NA> <unk> really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger roiling pot of universal stuff we
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 258.68 267.91 <NA> 're never going to see the stuff outside <unk> but by going to the south pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky we can figure out
AllanAdams_2014 1 AllanAdams_2014 267.73 274.03 <NA> that we 're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that and that amazes me <unk> thanks a lot
