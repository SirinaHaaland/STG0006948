SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 117.23 123.6 <NA> so for my first question for you today are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 125.63 129.67 <NA> thank you so when i was a graduate student at stanford
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 129.63 138.28 <NA> <unk> university <unk> i used to go to this very very upscale grocery store at least at that time it was truly upscale it was a store called draeger 's

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 145.46 154.25 <NA> over five hundred different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 155.5 158.56 <NA> <unk> i used to love going to this store <unk> but
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 158.34 164.19 <NA> on one occasion i asked myself <unk> well how come you never buy anything here 's their olive oil aisle
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 164.01 171.8 <NA> they had over seventy five different kinds of olive oil including those that were in a locked case that came from <unk> thousand year old olive trees <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 171.76 174.99 <NA> so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager and i asked
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 176.36 179.82 <NA> <unk> is this model of offering people all this choice really working 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 179.42 188.07 <NA> and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday with cameras ready usually <unk> we decided to do a little experiment <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 187.76 197.82 <NA> and we picked jam for our experiment here 's their jam aisle they had three hundred and forty eight different kinds of jam <unk> we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store <unk>
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 197.77 203.47 <NA> <unk> we there put out six different flavors of jam or twenty four different flavors of jam <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 205.02 208.68 <NA> first in which case were people more likely to
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 208.52 217.15 <NA> stop sample some jam more people stopped when there were twenty four about sixty percent than when there were six about forty percent <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 217.32 225.2 <NA> the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam now we see the opposite effect 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 225.2 229.97 <NA> of the people who stopped when there were twenty four only three percent of them actually bought a jar of
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 229.93 233.22 <NA> <unk> jam of the people who stopped when there were six <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 232.98 238.04 <NA> well now we saw that thirty percent of them actually bought a jar of jam <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 238.04 247.71 <NA> now if you do the math people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered twenty four now
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 247.53 254.79 <NA> choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us at least it 's good for our waistlines but it turns out that this choice overload problem
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 254.78 263.37 <NA> <unk> affects us even in very consequential decisions we choose not to choose even when it goes against our best <unk> self interests 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 263 267.99 <NA> so now for the topic of today financial savings now i <unk>

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 285.33 293.22 <NA> and what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan the four hundred and one plan <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 293.22 297.79 <NA> does that affect people 's likelihood to save more for tomorrow <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 297.63 304.28 <NA> and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation <unk> so in these plans we had about six hundred and
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 304.84 310.84 <NA> <unk> plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to fifty nine different fund offerings <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 310.62 320.96 <NA> and what we found was that the more funds offered indeed there was less participation rate so if you look at the extremes those plans that offered you <unk>
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 320.91 326.69 <NA> two funds participation rates were around in the <unk> mid 70s still not as high as we want it to be 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 329.98 339.72 <NA> participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile <unk> now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 339.52 345.69 <NA> when there are more choices present <unk> even then it has negative consequences <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 345.62 350.17 <NA> so for those people who did choose to participate <unk> the more choices available
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 350.16 355.6 <NA> <unk> the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 355.2 365.24 <NA> the more choices available the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts <unk> now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 394.03 404.97 <NA> the main reason for this is because <unk> we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises mustards vinegars jams but we can 't actually do the math of comparing
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 405.05 414.57 <NA> <unk> and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display <unk> so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 414.47 419.47 <NA> techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 419.47 425.26 <NA> that you can easily apply in your businesses the first <unk> cut

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 431.25 434.39 <NA> people are always upset when i say cut 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 434.39 446.2 <NA> they 're always worried they 're going to lose shelf space <unk> but in fact what we 're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut get rid of those extraneous redundant options <unk> well there 's an increase in sales 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 445.74 451.69 <NA> there 's a lowering of costs there is an improvement of the choosing experience

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 465.88 470.36 <NA> a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 470.17 478.89 <NA> you know the average grocery store today offers you forty five thousand products the typical walmart today offers you one hundred thousand products <unk> but the ninth

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 492.29 504.97 <NA> now in the financial savings world i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david laibson was heavily involved in designing which was the program that they have
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 504.99 506.14 <NA> <unk> at harvard

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 521.37 525.02 <NA> they 're all important choices and the first thing i do is i ask

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 532.99 541.5 <NA> now before we started our session this afternoon i had a chat with gary and gary said that he would be willing

SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 562.79 568.26 <NA> okay anybody who 's ready to take him up on his offer is that all 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 568.67 571.53 <NA> all right let me show you some more about this 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 574.43 576.7 <NA> you guys knew there was a trick didn 't you
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 583.65 586.63 <NA> now who 's ready to go on this trip 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 588.66 593.23 <NA> laughter i think i might have actually heard more hands <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 593.76 596.44 <NA> all right <unk> now
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 596.16 604.97 <NA> in fact you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 605.05 608.83 <NA> <unk> the second time around <unk> because the pictures made it
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 608.67 610.94 <NA> feel more real to you 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 610.96 617.21 <NA> which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem which is concretization 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 616.93 626.74 <NA> that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 626.74 629.7 <NA> and that the consequences need to be felt
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 629.96 632.97 <NA> <unk> vivid sort of way in a very concrete way <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 632.81 642.78 <NA> why do people spend an average of fifteen to thirty percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash <unk> because it doesn 't feel like real money 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 642.71 654.79 <NA> and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero we
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 655.74 661.37 <NA> we did a study with people at ing employees that are all working at ing
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 661.37 667.3 <NA> and now these people were all in a session where they 're doing enrollment for their four hundred and one plan <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 666.81 673.54 <NA> and during that session we kept the session exactly the way it used to be but we added one little thing 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 673.98 676.61 <NA> the one little thing we added
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 676.38 679.97 <NA> was we asked people to just think about all the positive
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 679.99 683.51 <NA> <unk> things that would happen in your life if you saved more 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 683.65 686.39 <NA> by doing that simple thing 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 686.11 696.89 <NA> there was an increase in enrollment by twenty percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 697.63 700.38 <NA> the third technique <unk> categorization
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 701.6 706.92 <NA> <unk> we can handle more categories than we can handle choices <unk> so for example 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 706.69 709.33 <NA> here 's a study we did in a magazine aisle it
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 709.15 713.42 <NA> turns out that in wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 713.43 720.66 <NA> the magazine aisles range anywhere from three hundred and thirty one different kinds of magazines all the way up to six hundred and sixty four 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 720.26 722.07 <NA> but you know what 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 722.21 729.79 <NA> if i show you six hundred magazines and i divide them up into ten categories versus i show you four hundred
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 729.72 732.48 <NA> <unk> magazines and divide them up into twenty categories 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 732.49 740.17 <NA> you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the four hundred than if i gave you the six hundred 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 739.86 743.89 <NA> because the categories tell me how to tell them apart <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 745.32 749.99 <NA> here are two different jewelry displays one is called jazz and
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 751.84 759.26 <NA> <unk> if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz clap your hands okay there 's
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 761.41 767.63 <NA> some if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing clap your hands okay
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 767.5 774.93 <NA> a bit more <unk> <unk> now it turns out you 're right the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing but you know what this
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 781.22 785.37 <NA> <unk> the categories need to say something to the chooser <unk> not the <unk>
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 786.58 794.61 <NA> and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds who are they actually supposed to be informing 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 795.02 804.37 <NA> my fourth technique <unk> condition for complexity it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can we 've just got to take it a little easier
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 805.04 814.69 <NA> have to gradually increase the complexity i 'm going to show you one example of what i 'm talking about let 's take a very very complicated decision buying a car <unk> 
SheenaIyengar_2011S 1 SheenaIyengar_2011S 814.2 828.26 <NA> here 's a german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car you 've got to make sixty different decisions completely make up your car <unk> now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision <unk>
