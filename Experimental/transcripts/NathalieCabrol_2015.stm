NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 20.87 24.15 <NA> that microbes have a lot to say about
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 23.96 25.05 <NA> questions such
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 27.29 38.82 <NA> <unk> and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system but also maybe beyond and this is why i am tracking them down in the most impossible places
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 38.42 47.95 <NA> on earth in extreme environments where conditions are really pushing them to the brink of survival actually sometimes me too when i 'm trying to follow them too close but
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 47.95 54.55 <NA> here 's the thing we are the only advanced civilization in the solar system
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 55.17 64.39 <NA> <unk> but that doesn 't mean that there is no microbial life nearby in fact the planets and moons you see here could host life
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 64.14 66.68 <NA> all of them and we know that 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 66.47 74.33 <NA> and it 's a strong possibility <unk> and if we were going to find life on those moons and planets 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 74.33 77.21 <NA> then we would answer questions such as 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 76.97 78.86 <NA> are we alone in the solar system
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 79.96 87.86 <NA> <unk> we coming from do we have family in the neighborhood is there life beyond our solar system <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 87.76 92.55 <NA> and we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 92.37 102.3 <NA> in our understanding of what a habitable planet is and today a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone where
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 102.06 104.97 <NA> water can stay stable but to me
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 104.93 115.41 <NA> <unk> this is a horizontal definition of habitability because it involves a distance to a star but there is another dimension to habitability and this is a vertical dimension 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 115.31 118.08 <NA> think of it as
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 119.9 124.93 <NA> conditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 125 133.15 <NA> from a sun but you still have water energy nutrients <unk> which for some of them means food and a protection 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 132.96 137 <NA> and when you look at the earth <unk> very far away
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 136.84 143.86 <NA> from any sunlight <unk> deep in the ocean you have life thriving and it uses only chemistry
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 143.37 148.72 <NA> for life processes <unk> so when you think of it
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 148.32 154.7 <NA> at that point all walls collapse you have no limitations basically <unk> and if you have been looking at the
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 154.66 163.19 <NA> <unk> headlines lately then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean on europa on ganymede on enceladus on titan <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 162.88 169.16 <NA> and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on enceladus our solar system is turning into a giant spa 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 169.24 175.16 <NA> for anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that right 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 175.64 185.46 <NA> <unk> that point think also about mars there is no life possible at the surface of mars today <unk> but it might still be hiding underground 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 185.33 186.81 <NA> so 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 187.85 197.72 <NA> we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on earth 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 197.72 199.63 <NA> and you can have what we call organic
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 200.49 207.88 <NA> <unk> and these are the bricks of life <unk> and you can have fossils <unk> and you can minerals biominerals which is
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 207.71 217.73 <NA> due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks and of course you can have gases in the atmosphere and when you look at those tiny green algae on the right of the slide here 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 217.68 223.9 <NA> <unk> they are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen a billion years ago in the atmosphere of the earth <unk>

NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 231.94 243.2 <NA> but as much as our understanding grows of all of these things there is one question we still cannot answer <unk> and this is where are we coming from <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 242.71 248.31 <NA> and you know it 's getting worse because we won 't be able to find the physical evidence
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 248.1 249.84 <NA> of where we are coming from on this
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 250.52 257.64 <NA> <unk> and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone all record is gone 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 257.18 261.43 <NA> erased by plate tectonics and erosion 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 261.43 268.62 <NA> this is what i call the earth 's biological horizon beyond this horizon we don 't know where we are coming from 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 268.31 271.74 <NA> so is everything lost well maybe not 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 271.64 276.64 <NA> and we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 279.9 289.21 <NA> <unk> possible well clearly at the beginning of the solar system <unk> mars and the earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 289.21 296.17 <NA> and there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place earth and mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 295.74 304.34 <NA> pieces of rocks landed on the earth <unk> pieces of the earth landed on mars <unk> so clearly those two planets may have been seeded by the same material
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 305.29 311.39 <NA> <unk> so yeah maybe granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us <unk> but
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 311.05 314.06 <NA> that also means that
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 313.86 323.03 <NA> we can go to mars and try to find traces of our own origin mars may hold that secret for us this is why mars is so special to us 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 322.69 327.45 <NA> but for that to happen mars needed to be habitable
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 327.29 328.83 <NA> at the time when
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 328.6 329.85 <NA> conditions were right
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 329.89 331.05 <NA> so
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 330.82 336.45 <NA> was mars habitable we have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 336.23 339.76 <NA> at the time when life appeared on the earth <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 339.52 341.89 <NA> mars did have an ocean <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 341.89 354.97 <NA> it had volcanoes <unk> it had lakes and it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here this picture was sent by the curiosity rover only a few weeks ago <unk> it shows the remnants of a delta <unk> and this picture tells us something
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 355.07 364.81 <NA> water was abundant and stayed founting at the surface for a very long time this is good news for life life chemistry takes a long time to actually happen <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 364.81 371.83 <NA> so this is extremely good news but does that mean that if we go there life will be easy to find on mars <unk> not necessarily 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 371.7 379.22 <NA> here 's what happened <unk> at the time when life exploded at the surface of the earth <unk> then everything went south for mars
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 380.04 383.14 <NA> <unk> the atmosphere was stripped away
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 382.98 386.75 <NA> by solar winds mars lost its magnetosphere <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 386.75 394.88 <NA> and then cosmic rays and u v bombarded the surface and water escaped to space and went underground <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 394.51 396.14 <NA> so
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 395.68 401.87 <NA> if we want to be able to understand if we want to be able to find those traces
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 401.47 404.61 <NA> of the signatures of life at the surface of mars
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 404.87 415.11 <NA> <unk> are there we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events on the preservation of its record only then will we be able
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 414.68 424.93 <NA> to know where those signatures are hiding and only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places where we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something really important
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 427.92 433.63 <NA> <unk> maybe telling us that somewhere independently life has appeared on another planet <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 433.5 442.06 <NA> so to do that it 's easy you only need to go back three point five billion years ago in the past of a planet <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 441.78 444.61 <NA> we just need a time machine <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 445.05 446.83 <NA> easy right well
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 446.67 454.88 <NA> actually it is look around you that 's planet earth <unk> this is our time machine <unk> geologists are using it to go back in the
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 454.81 458.81 <NA> <unk> past of our own planet i am using it a little bit differently 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 458.81 469.52 <NA> i use planet earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of mars at the time when the climate changed and there i 'm trying to understand what happened
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 469.03 474.14 <NA> what are the signatures of life what is left how are we going to find it 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 473.77 479.28 <NA> so for one moment now i 'm going to take you with me on a trip into that time machine
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 480.11 487.38 <NA> <unk> and now what you see here we are at four thousand five hundred meters in the andes <unk> but in fact we are
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 487.21 491.94 <NA> less than a billion years after the earth and mars formed 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 491.54 499.02 <NA> the earth and mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that volcanoes everywhere <unk> evaporating lakes everywhere <unk>

NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 511.92 516.53 <NA> but if we want to understand what 's going on we need to go a little further <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 516.53 525.29 <NA> and the other thing about those sites is that exactly like on mars three and a half billion years ago the climate is changing very fast and water and ice are disappearing
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 526.6 532.34 <NA> <unk> but we need to go back to that time when everything changed on mars and to do that we need to go higher 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 531.88 535.17 <NA> why is that because when you go higher <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 535.17 547.43 <NA> the atmosphere is getting thinner <unk> it 's getting more unstable the temperature is getting cooler <unk> and you have a lot more u v radiation <unk> basically you are getting to those conditions on mars
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 546.94 551.36 <NA> when everything changed <unk> so
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 551.47 554.49 <NA> i was not promising anything about
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 555.17 564.75 <NA> <unk> trip on the time machine you are not going to be sitting in that time machine you have to haul one thousand pounds of equipment to the summit of this 20 000 foot volcano
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 564.58 566.43 <NA> in the andes here 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 566.27 575.16 <NA> that 's about six thousand meters <unk> and you also have to sleep on 42 degree slopes and really hope that there won 't be any earthquake that night <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 575.06 577.44 <NA> but when we get to the summit 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 577.37 579.88 <NA> we actually find the lake we came for
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 580.05 588.4 <NA> at this altitude this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions as those on mars three and a half billion years ago <unk> 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 588.4 600.14 <NA> and now we have to change our voyage into an inner voyage inside that lake and to do that we have to remove our mountain gear and actually don suits and
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 600.91 602.18 <NA> <unk> go for it 
NathalieCabrol_2015 1 NathalieCabrol_2015 601.87 611.87 <NA> but at the time we enter that lake at the very moment we enter that lake we are stepping back three and a half billion years in the past of another planet <unk>
