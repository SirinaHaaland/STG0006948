StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 56.12 66.52 <NA> the the spread of coffee and tea through british culture what people drank both elite and mass folks drank day in and day out from dawn until dusk was alcohol <unk>
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 66.47 74.77 <NA> alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice <unk> you would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch a little gin particularly around one thousand six hundred and fifty

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 106.28 114.01 <NA> as england switched to to tea and coffee but the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the is the architecture of the space <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 114.01 124.93 <NA> it was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds different fields of expertise and share it was a space as matt ridley talked about where ideas could have sex <unk> this was their conjugal
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 125.28 133.3 <NA> <unk> in a sense ideas would get together there and an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in in their story

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 156.85 167.15 <NA> what i 've done is i 've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse i 've looked at media environments like the world wide web that have been extraordinarily innovative i 've gone back to the the history of the first cities <unk>
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 167.1 174.35 <NA> i 've even gone to biological environments like coral reefs and rainforests that involve unusual levels of biological innovation

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 191.38 194.92 <NA> and i think i 've found a few but what you have to do
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 194.53 199.88 <NA> to make sense of this and to really understand these principles is you have to do away with a lot of
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 199.88 204.97 <NA> the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us towards certain
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 207 216.25 <NA> <unk> we have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration <unk> we have the kind of the flash of insight <unk> the stroke of insight <unk> we have <unk>

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 225.75 229.88 <NA> share this basic assumption which is that an idea is a single thing
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 230.17 233.87 <NA> something that happens often in a wonderful

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 235.81 246.11 <NA> but in fact <unk> what i would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level <unk> i mean <unk> this is what is happening inside your brain <unk>
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 246.06 254.28 <NA> an idea a new idea is a new network of neurons firing in sync with each other inside your brain it 's a new configuration that has never formed before
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 254.96 260.71 <NA> <unk> the question is how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to form and
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 260.71 268.9 <NA> it turns out that in fact the kind of network patterns of the outside world mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of the of the human brain <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 268.66 275.01 <NA> so the metaphor i 'd like the use <unk> i can take from from a story of a great idea
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 280.17 288.79 <NA> <unk> a wonderful guy named timothy prestero who has a company called an organization called design that matters they decided to tackle this really pressing problem

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 300.84 304.97 <NA> any context if we can keep premature babies warm basically it 's very simple
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 304.96 316.46 <NA> <unk> we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments so the technology is there these are standard in all the industrialized worlds the problem is if you buy a $ forty thousand incubator <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 315.97 326.76 <NA> and you send it off to a mid sized village in africa <unk> it will work great for a year or two years <unk> and then something will go wrong and it will break and it will remain broken forever 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 326.76 329.82 <NA> because you don 't have a whole system of spare parts and you
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 329.93 334.26 <NA> <unk> have the on the ground expertise to fix this $ forty thousand piece of equipment 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 333.95 341.8 <NA> and so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries and then it ends up being useless so what
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 341.44 348.45 <NA> prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 348.44 354.97 <NA> and what they noticed was they don 't have a lot of dvrs they don 't have a lot of microwaves <unk> but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 355.05 363.05 <NA> <unk> on the road <unk> there 's a toyota forerunner on the street in all in all these places they seem to have the expertise to keep cars working 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 363.05 370.33 <NA> so they started to think could we build a neonatal incubator that 's built entirely out of automobile parts 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 370.23 379.79 <NA> and this is what they ended up coming with it 's called a neonurture device from the outside it looks like a normal little thing you 'd find in a modern western hospital in the inside it 's all car parts
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 379.96 392.03 <NA> <unk> 's got a fan <unk> it 's got headlights for warmth <unk> it 's got door chimes for alarm it runs off a car battery <unk> and so all you need is the spare parts from your toyota and the ability to fix a headlight and you can repair this thing 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 391.81 399.93 <NA> now that 's a great idea but what i 'd like to say is that in fact this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen we like to think our breakthrough ideas <unk> you know are like that $ forty thousand
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 405.02 417.5 <NA> <unk> together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby we take ideas from other people from people we 've learned from from people we run into in the coffee shop <unk> and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new that 's really where innovation happens <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 417.5 420.84 <NA> and that means that we have to change some of our models of what
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 420.41 426.46 <NA> innovation and deep thinking really looks like right <unk> i mean this is one vision of it another is newton and the apple
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 429.87 434.36 <NA> you 're sitting there thinking a deep thought and the apple falls from the tree and you have the theory of gravity <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 434.15 444.58 <NA> in fact <unk> the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this right this is hogarth 's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern but this is what the coffee <unk>
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 444.48 454.91 <NA> <unk> shops looked like back then <unk> this is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together where people were likely to have new interesting unpredictable collisions people from different backgrounds
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 454.92 463.58 <NA> so if we 're trying to build organizations that are more innovative we have to build spaces that strangely enough look a little bit more like this this is what your office should look like is part of my message here <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 463.87 475.11 <NA> and one of the problems with this is that people are actually when you when you research this field people are notoriously unreliable when they actually kind of self report on where they have their own good ideas or their history
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 476.06 482.31 <NA> <unk> their best ideas and a few years ago a wonderful researcher named kevin dunbar decided to go around
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 481.82 488.79 <NA> and basically do the big brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from he went to a bunch of science labs around the world

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 510.08 516.73 <NA> in the tissue sample and oh eureka they 've got the idea what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 516.48 529.4 <NA> is that in fact <unk> almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab in front of the microscope <unk> they happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 529.81 539.93 <NA> <unk> findings <unk> oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having the error the noise in the signal they were they were discovering <unk> and something about that environment and i 've started calling it the liquid <unk>

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 555.1 563.83 <NA> to kind of shorter time frames so they want to tell the story of the eureka moment <unk> they want to say there i was i was standing there and i had it all suddenly clear in my head 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 563.83 570.13 <NA> but in fact <unk> if you go back and look at the historical record it turns out that a lot of important ideas
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 569.93 574.87 <NA> have very long incubation periods i call this the slow hunch
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 581.07 586.68 <NA> <unk> sudden moments of clarity <unk> but in fact a lot of great ideas linger on sometimes for decades 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 586.69 593.27 <NA> in the back of people 's minds they have a feeling that there 's an interesting problem but they don 't quite have the tools yet to discover them <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 593.04 594.82 <NA> they spend all this time
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 594.45 604.97 <NA> working on certain problems but there 's another thing lingering there that they 're interested in but they can 't quite solve darwin is a great example of this darwin himself in his autobiography <unk> tells the
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 604.9 610.98 <NA> <unk> story of coming up with the idea for natural selection as a classic eureka moment he 's in his
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 610.8 621.45 <NA> study <unk> it 's october of one thousand eight hundred and thirty eight and he 's reading malthus actually on population and all of a sudden the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 621.45 624.81 <NA> ah at last i had a theory with which to work that 's in his
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 626.03 630.73 <NA> <unk> about a decade or two ago <unk> a wonderful scholar named howard gruber went back and looked at
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 630.55 637.2 <NA> darwin 's notebooks from this period and darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had every little hunch 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 636.97 647.31 <NA> and what gruber found was that darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany <unk>
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 647.26 653.47 <NA> reading malthus in october of one thousand eight hundred and thirty eight there are passages where you can read it and you think you 're reading from a darwin textbook
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 654.9 662.33 <NA> <unk> from the period before he has this epiphany <unk> and so what you realize is that darwin in a sense had the idea he had the concept but was
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 662.15 664.78 <NA> unable of fully thinking it yet <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 664.53 670.3 <NA> and that is actually how great ideas often happen they fade into view over long periods of time 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 670.29 679.85 <NA> now the challenge for all of us is how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half life right it 's hard to go to your boss and say i have an excellent idea for our organization
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 680.02 682.55 <NA> <unk> it will be useful in two thousand and twenty 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 682.99 691.07 <NA> could you just give me some time to do that now a couple of companies like google they have innovation time off twenty percent time where <unk> in a sense those are <unk> hunch cultivating
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 690.79 700.02 <NA> mechanisms in an organization <unk> but that 's a key thing and the other thing is to allow those hunches to connect with other people 's hunches that 's what often happens
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 700 706.18 <NA> <unk> you have half of an idea somebody else has the other half and if you 're in the right environment they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 706 715.72 <NA> so in a sense <unk> we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property <unk> you know building barricades having secretive r & d labs 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 715.72 725.26 <NA> patenting everything that we have so that those ideas will remain valuable and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas and the culture will be more innovative

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 785.12 792.04 <NA> there 's this you know man made satellite up there in outer space that 's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal we could probably hear it

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 792.88 799.53 <NA> and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues and everybody 's like no i hadn 't thought of doing that that <unk> that 's an interesting idea 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 799.53 803.41 <NA> and it turns out weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 803.19 804.91 <NA> reception and he 's got a little
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 804.84 813.26 <NA> <unk> antennae set up with an amplifier in his office and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach 's office and they start kind of noodling around hacking as we might call it now 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 813.26 818.08 <NA> and after a couple of hours they actually start picking up the signal because the soviets made
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 817.74 825.02 <NA> sputnik very easy to track it was right at twenty mhz so you could you could pick it up really easily because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax basically
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 825.04 827.63 <NA> <unk> so they made it really easy to to find it
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 827.14 834.56 <NA> so these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal and people start kind of coming into the office and saying wow that 's pretty cool can i hear wow that 's great 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 834.56 843.69 <NA> and before long they think well jeez this is kind of historic we may be the first people in the united states to be listening to this we should record it and so they bring in this big clunky analog tape recorder
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 843.3 852.56 <NA> and they start recording these little bleep bleeps <unk> and they start writing the kind of date stamp time stamps for each for each little bleep that they record <unk>

StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 858.88 861.1 <NA> calculate the speed
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 860.89 867.33 <NA> that the satellite is traveling if we do a little basic math here using the the doppler effect 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 867.14 873.69 <NA> and then they played around with it a little bit more and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties and
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 873.23 874.93 <NA> they said jeez you know we think we
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 875.22 877.26 <NA> <unk> look at the slope of the doppler effect
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 877.07 884.42 <NA> to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it 's farthest away <unk> that 's pretty cool 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 884.42 890.36 <NA> and eventually they get permission this is all a little side project that hadn 't been officially part of their job description
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 890.17 900.14 <NA> they get permission to use the new you know univac computer that takes up an entire room that they 'd just gotten at the <unk> apl they run some more of the numbers and at the end of about three or four weeks turns out they have mapped
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 900 902.99 <NA> <unk> the exact trajectory of this satellite
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 902.82 911.63 <NA> around the earth just from listening to this one little signal going off on this little side hunch that they 'd been inspired to do over over lunch one morning a
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 912.01 917.93 <NA> couple weeks later their boss frank mcclure <unk> pulls them into the room and says hey <unk> you guys i
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 917.47 921.92 <NA> have to ask you something about that project you were working on you 've figured out
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 921.55 924.08 <NA> an unknown location
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 923.74 929.91 <NA> of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground <unk> could you go the other way
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 929.92 935.22 <NA> could you figure out an unknown location on the ground if you knew the location of the satellite 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 935.06 943.68 <NA> and they thought about it and they said well i guess maybe you could let 's run the numbers here so they went back and they thought about it and they came back and said actually it 'll be easier 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 943.85 946.36 <NA> and he said oh that 's great because
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 946.12 950.26 <NA> see i have these new nuclear submarines that i 'm building
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 951.3 959.56 <NA> <unk> it 's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of moscow <unk> if you don 't know where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 959.1 969.07 <NA> so we 're thinking we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean could you work on that problem 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 968.64 972.16 <NA> and that 's how gps was born <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 972.36 977.54 <NA> thirty years later <unk> ronald reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 977.36 979.97 <NA> that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 980.05 982.37 <NA> <unk> and build new technology that would
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 982.17 985.64 <NA> that would create and innovate on top of this open platform 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 985.64 992.3 <NA> left it open for for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it and now i guarantee you
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 992.05 1001 <NA> certainly half of this room if not more has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space and i bet you
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 1000.51 1004.97 <NA> one of you if not more has used said device and said satellite
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 1004.99 1013.55 <NA> <unk> system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last in the last day or last week right 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 1016.33 1020.73 <NA> and that i think is a great case study a great lesson
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 1020.73 1029.67 <NA> in in the power the marvelous kind of unplanned emergent <unk> unpredictable power of open innovative systems when you build them right they will be led to
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 1029.78 1033.96 <NA> <unk> completely new directions that the creators never even dreamed of i mean here you have these guys
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 1033.96 1044.43 <NA> who basically thought they were just following this hunch this little passion that had developed then they thought they were fighting the cold war <unk> and then it turns out they 're just helping somebody find a soy latte 
StevenJohnson_2010G 1 StevenJohnson_2010G 1045.62 1051.28 <NA> that is how innovation happens <unk> chance favors the connected mind thank you very much
