TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 21.08 23.37 <NA> is to see how they 're used
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 23.15 25.05 <NA> in the real world in
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 26.75 31.93 <NA> <unk> i 'm reminded of that every time i walk past highbury fields in north london it
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 31.93 37.8 <NA> 's absolutely beautiful there 's a big open green space there 's georgian buildings around the side 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 37.31 41.01 <NA> but then there 's this mud trap that cuts across the middle 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 41.18 48.39 <NA> people clearly don 't want to walk all the way around the edge <unk> instead they want to take the shortcut <unk> and that shortcut is <unk>
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 50.97 54.13 <NA> <unk> this shortcut is called a desire path <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 53.7 61.22 <NA> and it 's often the path of least resistance <unk> i find them fascinating because they 're often the point where design
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 60.86 63.91 <NA> and user experience diverge 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 63.63 72.5 <NA> now at this point i should apologize because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere <unk> but today i 'm going to pick three i find interesting and share
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 72.34 79.94 <NA> what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services the first is in the capital city of brazil
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 79.9 86.25 <NA> <unk> brasilia <unk> and it reminds me that sometimes you have to just focus on designing for a real need
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 86.04 88.16 <NA> at low friction <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 87.73 98.22 <NA> now brasilia is fascinating it was designed by niemeyer in the ' 50s it was the golden age of flying so he laid it out like a plane as you can see there <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 98.22 99.99 <NA> slightly worryingly he put most of
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 100.04 103.05 <NA> <unk> important government buildings in the cockpit 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 102.89 107.97 <NA> but if you zoom in in the very center of brasilia just where the point is there 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 107.57 112.98 <NA> you see it 's littered with desire paths they 're absolutely everywhere <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 112.55 118.96 <NA> now they thought that they had future proofed this design they thought in the future we wouldn 't need to walk anywhere
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 118.78 124.87 <NA> we 'd be able to drive so there was little need for walkways or pavements <unk> but as you can
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 125.16 126.91 <NA> <unk> there 's a real need 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 127.05 134.69 <NA> these are very dangerous desire paths if we just pick one in the middle you can see it crosses fifteen lanes of traffic 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 134.69 140.24 <NA> it won 't surprise you guys that brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 139.91 142.36 <NA> of your average us city 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 142.41 150.37 <NA> people are resourceful they 'll always find the low friction route to save money save time 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 149.94 154.88 <NA> not all these desire paths are dangerous i was reminded flying here when i was in
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 154.81 161.48 <NA> <unk> heathrow many of us get frustrated when we 're confronted with the obligatory walk through duty free 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 162.52 172.46 <NA> it was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long meandering path to the left and just cut through to the right <unk> cut through the desire path <unk>
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 172.33 179.58 <NA> the question that 's interesting is what do designers think when they see our behavior here do they think we 're stupid
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 180.04 181.98 <NA> do they think we 're lazy 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 181.88 191.83 <NA> or do they accept that this is the only truth this is their product we 're effectively co designing their product <unk> so our job
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 191.38 198.57 <NA> is to design for real needs at low friction <unk> because if you don 't the customer will anyway <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 198.68 204.97 <NA> the second desire path i wanted to share is at the university of california <unk> and it reminds me that sometimes
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 205.17 207.86 <NA> <unk> the best way to come up with a great design
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 207.62 210.13 <NA> is just to launch it 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 210.36 217.9 <NA> now university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths i think it 's because students are always late and they 're pretty smart <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 217.9 222.01 <NA> so they 're dashing to lectures they 'll always find the shortcut <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 221.91 226.52 <NA> and the designers here knew that <unk> so they built the buildings
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 226.29 229.19 <NA> and then they waited a few months for the paths to form
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 229.96 231.53 <NA> <unk> then paved them 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 231.94 240.47 <NA> incredibly smart approach in fact often just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 240.1 246.5 <NA> for example ayr muir in boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant <unk> but where should it be 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 246.19 250.05 <NA> what should the menu be he launched a service
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 250.1 257.62 <NA> <unk> in this case a food truck <unk> and he changed the location each day he 'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 257.44 260.16 <NA> to figure out what people wanted 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 259.73 267.93 <NA> he now has a chain of restaurants <unk> so it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 267.68 271.68 <NA> the third and final desire path i wanted to share with you is the <unk>
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 273.11 275.02 <NA> it reminds me that the world 's
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 275.85 278.56 <NA> <unk> and we have to respond to those changes <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 278.19 281.23 <NA> so as you 'll guess this is a hospital 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 280.83 289.42 <NA> i 've marked for you on the left the oncology department the patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right <unk>
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 289.5 299.24 <NA> this was a patient centered organization so they laid on cars for their patients <unk> but what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 299 304.82 <NA> is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars they were too nauseous so they 'd walk back to
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 304.93 312.41 <NA> <unk> hotels this desire path that you see diagonally formed <unk> the patients even called it the chemo trail 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 312.43 318.2 <NA> now when the hospital saw this originally they tried to lay turf back over it ignore it <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 318.25 321.39 <NA> but after a while they realized it was an important
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 321.22 329.97 <NA> need they were meeting for their patients so they paved it and i think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths if we look back at the one
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 330.07 334.68 <NA> in north london again that desire path hasn 't always been there 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 334.31 344.67 <NA> the reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty arsenal football club stadium on game days from the underground station you see on the bottom right <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 344.3 349.9 <NA> so you see the desire path if we just wind the clock back a few years when the stadium was being
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 351.12 353.14 <NA> <unk> there is no desire path <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 353.28 358.3 <NA> so our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 358.08 362.8 <NA> and where appropriate pave them as someone did here <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 362.7 365.17 <NA> someone installed a barrier 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 365.58 370.72 <NA> people started walking across and round the bottom as you see and they paved it 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 371.22 375.14 <NA> laughter but i think this is a wonderful reminder as well that actually the world
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 375.7 385.73 <NA> <unk> 's constantly changing because if you look at the top of this image there 's another desire path forming <unk> so these three desire paths remind me
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 385.53 389.34 <NA> we need to design for real human needs 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 389.34 396.11 <NA> i think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 395.77 400.35 <NA> design for real needs and design them in low friction
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 401.06 403.57 <NA> <unk> because if you don 't offer them in low friction <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 403.33 406.6 <NA> someone else will often the customer 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 406.36 415.5 <NA> secondly often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service <unk> the answer is rarely inside the building 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 415.5 418.72 <NA> get out there and see what people really want <unk> 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 418.24 425.79 <NA> and finally in part because of technology the world is incredibly flux at the moment it 's changing constantly 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 425.79 429.6 <NA> these desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever 
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 429.23 430.84 <NA> our job
TomHulme_2016U 1 TomHulme_2016U 430.66 435.52 <NA> is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them <unk> thank you very much
