KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 35.71 40.75 <NA> is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory the ram
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 40.51 50.5 <NA> and the alu the arithmetic and logic unit <unk> and i thought to myself this cpu really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 50.5 54.34 <NA> through the system but nobody was really worried about this
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 54.9 62.35 <NA> <unk> when computers were first introduced <unk> they were said to be a million times faster than neurons people were

KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 81.25 82.95 <NA> it 's still not true <unk>
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 82.95 91.88 <NA> and so the question is why aren 't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain <unk> 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 91.84 98.6 <NA> what people didn 't realize and i 'm just beginning to realize right now is that we pay a huge price for the speed
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 98.11 104.94 <NA> that we claim is a big advantage of these computers <unk> let 's take a look at some numbers this
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 104.9 118.32 <NA> <unk> is blue gene the fastest computer in the world it 's got one hundred and twenty thousand processors <unk> they can basically process ten quadrillion bits of information per second that 's ten to the sixteenth 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 118.52 124.9 <NA> and they consume one and a half megawatts of power <unk> so that would be really
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 125.16 129.76 <NA> <unk> if you could add that to the production capacity in tanzania it would really boost the economy

KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 133.69 143.02 <NA> if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the states <unk> you get one thousand two hundred households in the u s 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 142.59 145.78 <NA> that 's how much power this computer uses
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 145.44 149.81 <NA> now let 's compare this with the brain <unk> this is a picture of
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 151.81 157.97 <NA> <unk> girlfriend 's brain rory is a graduate student at stanford he studies the brain using mri <unk> 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 157.93 162.29 <NA> and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 164.67 173.37 <NA> so that 's true love right there now how much computation does the brain do i estimate ten to the sixteen bits per second which is actually
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 173.15 174.96 <NA> about very similar to what blue
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 176.09 183.6 <NA> <unk> so that 's the question the question is how much they are doing a similar amount of processing similar amount of data the question is how much
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 183.14 191.31 <NA> energy or electricity does the brain use and it 's actually as much as your laptop computer it 's just ten watts
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 191.03 200.02 <NA> so what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by one thousand two hundred houses the brain is doing with the energy consumed by
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 201.99 208.41 <NA> <unk> so the question is how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency and let me just summarize so the bottom line the brain processes
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 208.25 214.51 <NA> information using one hundred thousand times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have how

KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 468.07 472.22 <NA> right now in two thousand and seven the technology that we are using
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 471.76 479.91 <NA> a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously side by side in fact there 's about

KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 495.98 500.08 <NA> onto the chip or your memory sticks that you have now can carry
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 503.49 510.64 <NA> <unk> transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen and technology has really benefitted from that but what 's happening now is that
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 510.45 514.54 <NA> in two thousand and fifteen the transistor is going to become so small 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 514.23 521.78 <NA> that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel <unk> and that corresponds to a single ion channel <unk> 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 521.78 524.78 <NA> and you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion

KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 548.86 554.97 <NA> ok so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory <unk> it sends it into the processor
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 555.07 560.52 <NA> or the alu and then it puts the result back into memory that 's the red path that 's highlighted 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 560.18 564 <NA> the way brains work i told you all you have got all these neurons <unk> 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 564 574.99 <NA> and the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons <unk> so you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 575.1 582.88 <NA> <unk> and then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity 
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 582.42 592.45 <NA> just by it flowing flowing through the network so you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 592.38 599.99 <NA> what you see here is that there 's these redundant connections <unk> so if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered
KwabenaBoahen_2007G 1 KwabenaBoahen_2007G 600 605.33 <NA> <unk> it doesn 't show up over here these two pieces can activate the missing part
