GeoffreyWest_2011G 1 GeoffreyWest_2011G 375.29 379.7 <NA> how do we understand this so let 's first talk about biology this is

GeoffreyWest_2011G 1 GeoffreyWest_2011G 404.84 413.73 <NA> <unk> way is that everybody lies on the same line <unk> despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe

GeoffreyWest_2011G 1 GeoffreyWest_2011G 449.81 454.97 <NA> which is less than one and we call that sublinear and here 's the point of that it says that

GeoffreyWest_2011G 1 GeoffreyWest_2011G 473.64 479.16 <NA> is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale the bigger you are systematically according to very
