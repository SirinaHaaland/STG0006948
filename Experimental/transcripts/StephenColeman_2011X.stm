StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 12.37 18.95 <NA> <unk> what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 18.49 24.89 <NA> australia <unk> united states the uk and so on face in some of the deployments that they 're dealing with
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 24.88 29.79 <NA> in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things we 've sent australian military
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 29.72 38.34 <NA> <unk> personnel to in recent years we 've got obvious things like iraq and afghanistan but you 've also got things like east timor and the solomon islands and so on <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 38.34 43.2 <NA> and a lot of these deployments that we 're sending military personnel to these days aren 't
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 43.04 49.81 <NA> traditional wars <unk> in fact a lot of the jobs <unk> we 're asking military personnel to do in those
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 50 56.29 <NA> situations are ones that in their own countries australia the us and so on would actually be done by police officers
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 56.1 65.21 <NA> so there 's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they 're doing things they haven 't really been trained for and they 're doing things
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 65 66.46 <NA> that
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 66.51 78.17 <NA> those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for <unk> now there 's a bunch of reasons why we send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 78.17 79.73 <NA> if australia had to send
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 80.17 90.17 <NA> <unk> people tomorrow to west papua for example <unk> we don 't have one thousand police officers hanging around that could go tomorrow and we do have one thousand soldiers that could go <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 89.71 100.02 <NA> so when we have to send someone we send the military they 're there they 're available and heck they 're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 100.02 104.7 <NA> so they are able to do it in that sense <unk> but they aren 't trained the same way
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 104.78 112.62 <NA> <unk> police officers are and they 're certainly not equipped the way police officers are so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these issues 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 112.16 124.99 <NA> one particular thing that 's come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether when we 're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 125.34 127.88 <NA> <unk> nonlethal weapons that police have 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 127.88 138.65 <NA> since they 're doing some of the same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and there 's a range of places you 'd think those things would be really useful for example when you 've got military checkpoints 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 138.42 149.99 <NA> if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel are unsure if this person 's hostile or not <unk> say this person approaching here and they say is this a suicide bomber or not <unk> is something hidden under their clothes what 's
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 151.93 156.9 <NA> <unk> person is hostile or not if the person doesn 't follow directions they may end up shooting them 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 156.9 164.45 <NA> and then find out afterwards either <unk> yes we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn 't understand what was going on <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 164.05 172.91 <NA> so if they had nonlethal weapons then they would say we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn 't hostile at least we haven 't killed them 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 172.57 177.27 <NA> another situation this photo is from one of the missions in the balkans in the late
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 180.04 187.74 <NA> where maybe they know someone is hostile <unk> they 've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that 's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 187.74 193.26 <NA> but if they respond there 's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt it 'd
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 192.95 200.14 <NA> be collateral damage that the military often doesn 't want to talk about so again they 'd say <unk> with access to nonlethal weapons
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 200.1 207.79 <NA> <unk> if we 've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else at least we 're not going to kill them 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 207.57 221.77 <NA> another suggestion has been since we 're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they 're actually going to send robots out in the field that are autonomous they 'll make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without a human in the loop <unk>
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 221.58 226.79 <NA> so the suggestion is if we 're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 229.78 236.18 <NA> <unk> nonlethal weapons so if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven 't actually killed them <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 236.08 250.02 <NA> now there 's a whole range of different sorts of nonlethal weapons some of which are available now some of which they 're developing <unk> you 've got traditional things like pepper spray <unk> oc spray up at the top there or tasers over here <unk> the one on the top right here is

StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 269.09 272.61 <NA> it 's essentially a big microwave transmitter 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 272.27 275.08 <NA> it 's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 275.88 286.69 <NA> <unk> it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things anybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 286.32 293.97 <NA> it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 293.97 298.55 <NA> so you feel this massive heat and you go i want to get out of the way and
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 298.34 304.76 <NA> they think this will be really useful in places where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 304.96 309.44 <NA> <unk> need to keep people away from a particular place we can do that with these sorts of things
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 309.7 320.03 <NA> <unk> so there 's a whole range of different nonlethal weapons we could give military personnel <unk> and there 's a whole range of situations where they 're looking at them and saying these things would be really useful 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 319.99 324.93 <NA> but as i said the military and the police are very
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 327.02 330.84 <NA> <unk> have to look very hard at this to recognize that they might be very different
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 330.53 338.34 <NA> <unk> in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they 're trained to use force is especially different 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 338.39 347.59 <NA> the police and knowing because i 've actually helped to train police police particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 347.38 354.91 <NA> to <unk> de escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 354.92 358.06 <NA> only as an absolute last resort 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 357.93 367.51 <NA> military personnel are being trained for war <unk> so they 're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 367.38 371.95 <NA> <unk> the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 371.91 374.83 <NA> you can start shooting at people 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 375.24 379.97 <NA> so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 380.01 387.74 <NA> and i think it 's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of nonlethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 387.67 397.62 <NA> and since we 've already had so many problems with police use of nonlethal weapons in various ways i thought it would be a good idea to look at some of those things and relate it to the military context
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 397.62 400.08 <NA> i was very surprised when i started to do this to see
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 401.33 404.5 <NA> <unk> people who advocated the use of nonlethal weapons by the military
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 404.26 406.53 <NA> hadn 't actually done that 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 406.04 410.71 <NA> they generally seemed to think why would we care what 's happened with the police we
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 410.71 416.31 <NA> 're looking at something different and didn 't seem to recognize <unk> they were looking at pretty much the same stuff 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 415.94 427.39 <NA> so i started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way police use nonlethal weapons when they 're introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 427.2 429.97 <NA> when they actually do introduce them and
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 430.07 439.55 <NA> of course <unk> being australian i started looking at stuff in australia knowing from my own experience of various times when nonlethal weapons have been introduced in australia <unk>
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 439.55 445.85 <NA> one of the things i particularly looked at was the use of oc spray oleoresin capsicum spray pepper spray
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 445.67 446.72 <NA> by
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 446.51 454.94 <NA> australian police and seeing what had happened when that had been introduced and those sorts of issues <unk> and one study that i found a particularly interesting
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 454.87 463.28 <NA> <unk> one was in queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 462.97 473.33 <NA> <unk> and i went and had a look at some of the figures here <unk> now <unk> when they introduced oc spray in queensland they were really explicit the police minister 's and a heap of public statements were made <unk>
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 473.23 479.58 <NA> <unk> about it they were saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 480.2 486.55 <NA> <unk> this is something they can use instead of a firearm in situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 486.31 497.1 <NA> so i looked at all of the police shooting figures and you can 't actually find them very easily for individual australian states i could only find these this is from an australian institute of criminology <unk>
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 497 504.97 <NA> <unk> report you can see in the fine print at the top police shooting deaths means not just people shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 504.93 506.11 <NA> <unk> presence of police 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 505.94 516.34 <NA> but these are the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where queensland said yes this is where we 're going to give all police officers across the entire state access <unk>
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 516.24 522.65 <NA> <unk> to oc spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 529.66 534.38 <NA> <unk> victoria yes correct <unk> that spike was all victoria 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 534.49 540.12 <NA> so it wasn 't that queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 540.12 554.91 <NA> so six shootings across the whole country <unk> fairly consistently over the years before the next two years were the years they studied two thousand and one two thousand and two anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they 've introduced this the number of times police in queensland used oc spray in that period
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 555.23 560.07 <NA> hundreds one <unk> three a thousand is getting better 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 561.92 571.18 <NA> explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting i 'm going to go out on a limb here
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 571.13 578.35 <NA> <unk> and say that if queensland police didn 't have oc spray they wouldn 't have shot two thousand two hundred and twenty six people in those two years
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 580.79 584.45 <NA> laughter in fact if you have a look at the studies they were looking at 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 584.45 594.37 <NA> the material they were collecting and and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about fifteen percent of cases where oc spray was used
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 594.48 600.02 <NA> <unk> it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were

StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 604.91 612.89 <NA> it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent <unk> who were potentially violent <unk> and also quite frequently used
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 612.46 616.58 <NA> to deal with people who were simply passively noncompliant

StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 630.11 640.35 <NA> way this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it 's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 639.95 646.14 <NA> now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of nonlethal weapons and people <unk>
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 647.33 653.47 <NA> <unk> might be some problems there 's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 654.87 663.94 <NA> <unk> weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate you have to be careful about who you 're shooting at 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 664.35 677.27 <NA> so one of the problems suggested with nonlethal weapons is that they might be used indiscriminately that you would use them against a whole range of people because you don 't have to worry so much anymore <unk> and in fact <unk> one particular instance where i think that actually happens
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 679.9 685.71 <NA> <unk> moscow in two thousand and two which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students at adfa are old enough to remember <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 685.71 696.02 <NA> so <unk> chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they were holding something like seven hundred people hostage they 'd released a bunch of people but they still had about seven hundred people hostage <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 695.59 699.78 <NA> and the russian military police
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 701.42 711.46 <NA> <unk> came in and stormed the theater the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas <unk> and it turned out that lots of the hostages died
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 711.25 714.06 <NA> as a result of inhaling the gas
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 713.9 719.19 <NA> <unk> it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 718.97 724.99 <NA> and it 's no surprise that people died because you don 't know how much gas each person is
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 725.04 732.38 <NA> <unk> to inhale what position they 'll fall in when they become unconscious and so on there were in fact only a couple of people who got shot
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 732.38 741.58 <NA> in this episode <unk> so when they had a look at it afterward there were only a couple of people who 'd apparently been shot by the hostage takers or by the
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 741.21 746.65 <NA> police forces trying to deal with the situation <unk> virtually everybody that got killed got killed
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 746.65 754.79 <NA> from inhaling the gas <unk> the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it 's certainly a few more than that because other people

StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 756.15 760.32 <NA> so this was one problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately a
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 760.32 771.72 <NA> second problem people sometimes talk about with military use of nonlethal weapons and it 's actually why in the chemical weapons convention it 's very clear that you can 't use riot control agents as weapons of warfare
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 772.69 779.91 <NA> <unk> that it 's seen that sometimes nonlethal weapons might be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a lethal force multiplier
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 780.17 785.94 <NA> that you use nonlethal weapons first so your lethal weapons will actually be more effective 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 785.63 794.85 <NA> the people you 'll be shooting at won 't be able to get out of the way they won 't be aware of what 's happening <unk> and you can kill them better <unk> and that 's exactly what happened here <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 795.14 800.08 <NA> the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 800.25 801.88 <NA> <unk> were simply shot in the head <unk> 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 803.01 814.33 <NA> so this nonlethal weapon was being used in this case as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 814.92 818.5 <NA> another problem i want to quickly mention is that
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 818.5 824.99 <NA> there 's a whole heap of problems with the way people are actually taught to use nonlethal weapons and get trained about them and then
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 825 833.21 <NA> <unk> tested and so on because they 're tested in nice <unk> safe environments and are taught to use them in nice safe environments like this where
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 832.87 840.02 <NA> you can see exactly what 's going on the person spraying the oc spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don 't get contaminated and so on <unk>

StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 921.47 925.08 <NA> another child within weeks of tasering the six year old boy <unk> just
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 945.74 954.13 <NA> <unk> i checked the reports on this one i looked at it i was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 955.44 961.03 <NA> i kid you not that 's exactly what it said she took up a more threatening position in her bed 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 962.16 967.39 <NA> but i 'd remind you i 'm talking about military uses of nonlethal weapons so why is this relevant
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 967.38 975.02 <NA> <unk> because police are actually more restrained in the use of force than the military are they 're trained to be more restrained in the use of force than
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 975.79 982.01 <NA> <unk> they 're trained to think more to try and de escalate so if you have these problems with police officers with nonlethal weapons <unk>

StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 1001.31 1004.55 <NA> so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 1005.95 1010.91 <NA> but it 's also going to be something that doesn 't leave any lasting effects 
StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 1012.07 1017.75 <NA> in other words your perfect nonlethal weapon is something that 's perfect for abuse

StephenColeman_2011X 1 StephenColeman_2011X 1030.47 1031.52 <NA> <unk> so i think
