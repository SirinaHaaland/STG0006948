AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 12.28 15.44 <NA> <unk> i 'm a huge believer in hands on education <unk> 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 16.09 28.07 <NA> but you have to have the right tools <unk> if i 'm going to teach my daughter about electronics i 'm not going to give her a soldering iron <unk> and similarly <unk> she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 27.67 29.94 <NA> so my wonderful student sam and
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 29.95 37.05 <NA> and i decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of play doh and so we spent a summer
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 36.77 39.69 <NA> looking at different play doh recipes <unk> 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 39.23 46.63 <NA> and these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade <unk> play dough pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 46.63 49.96 <NA> we have two favorite recipes one that has these ingredients
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 49.78 54.97 <NA> and a second that had sugar instead of salt <unk> and they 're great we can make great little sculptures with these
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 54.78 58.78 <NA> <unk> these but the really cool thing about them is when we put them together 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 58.55 68.8 <NA> you see that really salty play doh well it conducts electricity <unk> and this is nothing new it turns out that regular play doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity and high school physics teachers have used that for years <unk> 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 68.8 75.02 <NA> but our homemade play dough actually has half the resistance of commercial play doh and that sugar dough <unk> 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 75 82.49 <NA> well it 's one hundred and fifty times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough so what does that mean <unk> well it means if you them together
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 82.12 84.14 <NA> you suddenly have circuits
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 83.94 89.36 <NA> circuits that the most creative tiny little hands can build on their own applause
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 94.93 97.4 <NA> so i want to do a little demo for you 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 98.86 104.61 <NA> so if i take this salt dough again it 's like the play dough you probably made as kids and i plug it in
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 105.11 111.57 <NA> 's a two lead battery pack simple battery pack you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 112.01 114.66 <NA> we can actually then
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 116.03 117.99 <NA> light things up
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 119.27 124.93 <NA> but if any of you have studied electrical engineering we can also create a short circuit if i push these together 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 124.93 129.61 <NA> the light turns off right the current wants to run through the play dough not through that led if i separate them again
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 129.99 131.35 <NA> <unk> have some light <unk> 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 130.89 138.74 <NA> well now if i take that sugar dough the sugar dough doesn 't want to conduct electricity it 's like a wall to the electricity <unk> if i place that between now all the dough is touching <unk> 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 138.74 141.64 <NA> but if i stick that light back in 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 141.63 150.85 <NA> i have light in fact i could even add some movement to my sculptures if i want a spinning tail let 's grab a motor put some play dough on it 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 150.51 152.38 <NA> stick it on
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 152.1 153.38 <NA> and we have spinning
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 157.3 161.48 <NA> and once you have the basics <unk> we can make a slightly more complicated circuit <unk> 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 161.02 167.33 <NA> we call this our sushi circuit it 's very popular with kids <unk> i plug in again the power to it 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 166.99 173.72 <NA> and now i can start talking about parallel and series circuits i can start plugging in lots of lights 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 175.42 179.97 <NA> and we can start talking about things like electrical load what happens if i put in lots
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 179.99 186.45 <NA> <unk> of lights and then add a motor it 'll dim <unk> we can even
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 186.32 192.27 <NA> add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we 've done 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 191.9 196.47 <NA> you could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 197.3 199.78 <NA> so this is all in your home
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 200.78 211.12 <NA> actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab we have a website it 's all there these are the home recipes we 've got some videos you can make them yourselves and it 's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone <unk>
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 211.07 218.2 <NA> <unk> we 've had a mom in utah who used them with her kids to a science researcher in the u k and curriculum developers in hawaii <unk> 
AnnMarieThomas_2011 1 AnnMarieThomas_2011 225.1 231.9 <NA> <unk> an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers but maybe we should have fun thank you
