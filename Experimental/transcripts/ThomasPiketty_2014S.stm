ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 26.54 34.2 <NA> <unk> historical evidence is indeed that in the long run there is a tendency for the rate of return of capital to exceed

ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 35.59 45.96 <NA> and this tends to lead to high concentration of wealth <unk> not infinite concentration of wealth but the higher the gap between r and g <unk> the higher the level of inequality <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 45.86 51.82 <NA> <unk> of wealth towards which society tends to converge <unk> so this is a key force that i 'm going to
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 54.93 63.44 <NA> <unk> that this is not the only important force in the dynamics of income and wealth distribution <unk> and there are many other forces that play an important role
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 63.23 72.29 <NA> in the long run dynamics of income and wealth distribution also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected we know a little bit more
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 72.29 79.4 <NA> today than we used to know but we still know too little and certainly there are many different processes economic social
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 79.9 84.32 <NA> <unk> that need to be studied more and so i 'm going to focus today on this simple
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 83.86 84.95 <NA> force but
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 84.75 95.3 <NA> that doesn 't mean that other important forces do not exist so most of the data i 'm going to present comes from this database that 's available online the world top incomes database <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 95.2 104.97 <NA> <unk> so this is the largest existing historical database on inequality <unk> and this comes from the effort of over thirty scholars from several dozen countries
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 104.99 107.34 <NA> <unk> so let me show you a couple of
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 107.17 117.54 <NA> facts coming from this database and then we 'll return to r bigger than g <unk> so fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 117.44 123.88 <NA> <unk> the united states and europe over the past century <unk> so back in one thousand nine hundred one thousand nine hundred and ten income inequality was actually
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 129.96 140.08 <NA> <unk> be very clear <unk> the main explanation for this is not r bigger than g it has more to do with changing supply and demand for skill <unk> the race between education and <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 139.98 153.8 <NA> <unk> technology <unk> globalization probably more unequal access to skills in the u s where you have very good very top universities but where the bottom part of the educational system is not as good so very unequal access to skills <unk> 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 154.96 168.88 <NA> <unk> unprecedented rise of top managerial compensation of the united states which is difficult to account for just on the basis of education so there is more going on here but i 'm not going to talk too much about this today because i want to focus on wealth inequality <unk> 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 169.59 179.97 <NA> let me just show you a very simple indicator about the income inequality part <unk> so this is the share of total income going to the top ten percent <unk> so you can see that one
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 179.9 181.02 <NA> <unk> century ago
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 181.02 191.77 <NA> <unk> it was between forty five and fifty percent in europe and a little bit above forty percent in the u s so there was more inequality in europe then there was a sharp decline
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 191.35 200.1 <NA> during the first half of the 20th century and in the recent decade you can see that the u s has become more unequal than europe and this is
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 199.64 204.16 <NA> the first fact i just talked about now the second fact
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 203.91 204.91 <NA> is more about
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 204.84 213.16 <NA> <unk> wealth inequality <unk> and here the central fact is that wealth inequality is always a lot higher than income inequality <unk> and also that
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 212.96 223.42 <NA> wealth inequality although it has also increased in recent decades is still less extreme today than what it was a century ago <unk> although the total quantity of wealth <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 223.37 229.67 <NA> relative to income has now recovered from the very large shocks caused by world war i the great depression world war
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 230.02 233.01 <NA> <unk> so let me show you two graphs illustrating
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 233.01 240.71 <NA> fact number two and fact number three so first if you look at the level of wealth inequality <unk> this is
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 240.46 253.16 <NA> the share of total wealth going to the top ten percent of wealth holders <unk> so you can see the same kind of reversal between the u s and europe that we had before for income inequality <unk> so wealth
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 253.16 254.46 <NA> concentration was
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 255.4 259.63 <NA> in europe than in the u s a century ago and now it is the opposite <unk> 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 259.42 270.47 <NA> but you can also show two things first <unk> the general level of wealth inequality is always higher than income inequality <unk> so remember for income inequality
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 270.47 274.99 <NA> the share going to the top ten percent was between thirty and
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 278.82 288.68 <NA> <unk> share is always between sixty and ninety percent okay so that 's fact number one and that 's very important for what follows wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 288.68 290.41 <NA> fact number two
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 290.01 299.9 <NA> is that the rise in in wealth inequality in recent decades is still not enough to get us back to one thousand nine hundred and ten so the
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 303.7 313.91 <NA> <unk> seventy percent of total wealth for the top ten <unk> but the good news is that it 's actually better than one century ago <unk> where you had ninety percent in europe going to the top ten so <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 313.81 321.3 <NA> <unk> today what you have is what i call the middle forty percent the people who are not in the top ten and who are not in the bottom fifty 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 325 329.34 <NA> <unk> twenty to thirty percent of total wealth national wealth <unk> whereas they used
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 329.33 337.18 <NA> to be poor a century ago when there was basically no wealth middle class so this is an important change and
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 336.96 340.44 <NA> it 's interesting to see that wealth inequality
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 340.31 342.51 <NA> has not fully recovered to <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 343.69 349.29 <NA> although the total quantity of wealth <unk> has recovered okay so this is the total value
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 349.29 354.97 <NA> of wealth relative to income and you can see that in particular in europe we are almost
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 355.02 360.04 <NA> <unk> back to <unk> the pre world war i level <unk> so there are really two different
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 359.84 368.95 <NA> parts of the story here <unk> one has to do with the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate and there is nothing bad per se of course in accumulating a lot of wealth 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 368.95 370.91 <NA> and in particular if it is
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 370.72 374.84 <NA> more diffuse and less concentrated <unk> so what we really want to
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 376.6 380.61 <NA> <unk> evolution of wealth inequality <unk> and what 's going to happen in the future <unk> 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 380.61 390.48 <NA> how can we account for the fact that until world war i wealth inequality was so high and if anything was rising to even higher levels <unk> and
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 390.29 395.84 <NA> how can we think about the future <unk> so let me come to some of the
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 395.44 404.64 <NA> explanations and speculations about the future <unk> let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 405.05 419.41 <NA> <unk> more concentrated than income is a dynamic <unk> dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons if people were accumulating wealth only for life cycle reasons <unk> 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 419.41 423.12 <NA> you know to be able to consume when they are old <unk> 
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 422.63 429.49 <NA> then the level of wealth inequality should be more or less in line with the level of income inequality
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 429.9 437.6 <NA> <unk> it will be very difficult to to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model so you need
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 437.6 440.83 <NA> a story where people also care
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 440.52 450.08 <NA> about wealth accumulation for other reasons so typically they want to transmit wealth to the next generation to their children or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 450.04 459.73 <NA> <unk> because of the prestige the power that goes with wealth so there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data now
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 459.73 468.17 <NA> <unk> in a large class of dynamic models of wealth accumulation with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 467.74 474.96 <NA> you will have all sorts of random <unk> multiplicative shocks so for instance some families have a very large number of
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 475.43 484.31 <NA> <unk> so the wealth will be divided some families have fewer children <unk> you also have shocks to rates of return some families make huge capital gains some made
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 484.31 487.69 <NA> bad investments so you will always have some mobility
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 487.21 494.98 <NA> in the wealth process some people will move up some people will move down the important point is that in any such model for a given
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 494.98 501.48 <NA> variance of such shocks the equilibrium level of wealth inequality will be a steeply rising

ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 504.99 510.11 <NA> <unk> reason why the difference between the rate of return to wealth and the growth rate is important
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 509.93 520.27 <NA> is that initial wealth inequalities will be amplified at a faster pace with a bigger r minus g <unk> so take a simple example <unk> with r equals five percent <unk>
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 520.17 529.94 <NA> <unk> and g equals one percent wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 530.73 541.02 <NA> <unk> so this makes it easier to build and perpetuate large fortunes because you can consume four fifths <unk> assuming zero tax and you can just reinvest one fifth so of course some families
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 540.97 550.05 <NA> <unk> will consume more than that some will consume less so there will be some mobility in the distribution but on average they only need to reinvest one fifth <unk> so this allows
ThomasPiketty_2014S 1 ThomasPiketty_2014S 553.73 565.32 <NA> <unk> you should not be surprised by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever because in fact this is what happened during most of the history of mankind <unk> and this was in a way very obvious to everybody
