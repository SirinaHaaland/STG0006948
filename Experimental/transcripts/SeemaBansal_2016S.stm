SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 351.93 360.08 <NA> you see what had happened was over the last two decades india had been fighting the challenge of access having enough schools 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 359.9 368.27 <NA> and enrollment <unk> bringing children into the schools <unk> so the government launched a whole host of programs to address these challenges 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 368.27 375.29 <NA> and the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs not explicitly but implicitly

SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 397.36 403.86 <NA> so as we went through the education system as we delved into it deeper <unk> we found a few such
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 403.68 405 <NA> core root causes

SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 426.93 432.56 <NA> <unk> we had the goal and we had the issues <unk> and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 432.56 441.34 <NA> we obviously did not want to recreate the wheel so we said let 's look around and see what we can find and we found these beautiful small
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 441.15 450.02 <NA> pilot experiments all over the country and all over the world <unk> small things being done by ngos being done by foundations <unk> 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 450 461.09 <NA> but what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled all of them were limited to fifty one hundred or five hundred schools and here we were looking for a solution for fifteen thousand schools <unk> 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 460.6 466.16 <NA> so we looked into why <unk> if these things actually work why don 't they actually scale <unk> 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 466 479.42 <NA> what happens is that when a typical ngo comes in they not only bring in their expertise but they also bring in additional resources so they might bring in money they might bring in people they might bring in technology 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 479.96 487.41 <NA> <unk> fifty or one hundred schools that they actually operate in those additional resources actually create a difference <unk> 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 486.92 495.96 <NA> but now imagine that the head of this ngo goes to the head of the school education department and says hey now let 's do this for fifteen thousand schools 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 495.56 504.94 <NA> where is that guy or girl going to find the money to actually scale this up to fifteen thousand schools <unk> he doesn 't have the additional money he doesn 't have the resources
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 505.16 508.51 <NA> <unk> and hence <unk> innovations don 't scale <unk> 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 508.35 518.56 <NA> so right at the beginning of the project what we said was whatever we have to do has to be scalable it has to work in all fifteen thousand schools and <unk>
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 518.46 524.57 <NA> <unk> hence it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 528.76 535.52 <NA> <unk> i think this was definitely the point in time when my team hated me <unk> we spent a lot of long hours
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 535.32 548.27 <NA> in office <unk> in cafs sometimes even in bars scratching out heads and saying where are the solutions how are we going to solve this problem in the end i think we did find solutions to many of the issues i
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 548.27 550.01 <NA> 'll give you an example 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 549.79 553.98 <NA> in the context of effective learning one of the things people talk about is
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 555.07 561.01 <NA> children shouldn 't memorize things from books they should do activities and that 's a more effective way to learn 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 560.8 571.9 <NA> which basically means giving students things like beads learning rods abacuses but we did not have the budgets to give that to fifteen thousand schools two million children 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 571.9 574.05 <NA> we needed another solution we couldn
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 573.83 574.96 <NA> 't think of
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 576.3 579.01 <NA> <unk> one day one of our team members went to a school
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 578.84 587.44 <NA> and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students

SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 591.03 604.91 <NA> so what happens now in the textbooks in haryana is that after every concept we have a little box which are instructions for the teachers which say to teach this concept <unk> here 's an activity that you can do and by the way in
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 604.9 615.87 <NA> <unk> order to actually do this activity here are things that you can use from your immediate environment whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside which can be used as learning aids for kids 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 615.87 622.37 <NA> and we see teachers all over haryana using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students <unk> 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 622.06 623.57 <NA> so in this way <unk>
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 626.06 631.5 <NA> <unk> we were actually able to implement it across all fifteen thousand schools from day one 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 631.76 640.02 <NA> now this brings me to my last point how do you implement something across fifteen thousand schools and one hundred thousand teachers 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 639.8 646.77 <NA> the department used to have a process which is very interesting i like to call it the chain of hope

SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 679.78 684.38 <NA> <unk> started implementing it it was a little bit ridiculous <unk> 
SeemaBansal_2016S 1 SeemaBansal_2016S 684.13 691.82 <NA> now we knew technology was the answer <unk> but we also knew that most of these schools don 't have a computer or email
