DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 473.41 478.86 <NA> so the website of the national cancer institute says that cancer is a genetic disease

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 519.54 527.02 <NA> the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer and i think that 's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 527.02 529.88 <NA> is that we have strived to understand cancer
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 530.11 532.76 <NA> the goal is to control cancer and
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 532.3 537.92 <NA> that is a very different optimization scheme a very different strategy for all of us 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 537.92 544.11 <NA> i got up at the american association of cancer research one of the big cancer research meetings with twenty thousand people there

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 555.1 561.83 <NA> people got upset but this is the only way we 're going to go forward you know i was very fortunate to meet
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 561.67 568.13 <NA> danny hillis a few years ago <unk> we were pushed together <unk> and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 574.56 579.4 <NA> but people prevailed on us and we got together and it 's been transformative in what i do
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 580.05 582.13 <NA> <unk> absolutely transformative 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 582.51 593.29 <NA> we have designed and we have worked on the modeling and much of these ideas came from danny and from his team the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 592.92 599.11 <NA> and i 'll show you some data there where i really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 598.77 600.11 <NA> the key is
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 600.34 609.44 <NA> <unk> when you look at these variables and you look at this data you have to understand the data inputs you know if i measured your temperature
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 608.98 617.4 <NA> over thirty days <unk> and i asked what was the average temperature and it came back at ninety eight point seven <unk> i would say great 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 617.4 626.06 <NA> but if during one of those days your temperature spiked to one hundred and two for six hours and you took tylenol and got better etc i would totally miss it <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 625.75 629.97 <NA> so one of the problems the fundamental problems in medicine is that you

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 661.53 663.22 <NA> are really
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 663.12 670.48 <NA> different than we understand them because we 're not measuring them dynamically <unk> and so <unk> if you think of cancer

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 695.32 700.05 <NA> is hidden so what we do in our field is we change and input we give

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 852.56 855.63 <NA> <unk> i give them that same drug every week 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 855.2 863.42 <NA> another thirty percent will respond <unk> they then recur <unk> i give them that same drug over ninety six hours by continuous infusion 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 863.2 865.93 <NA> another twenty or thirty percent will respond 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 865.72 873.46 <NA> so you can 't tell me it 's working by the same mechanism in all three size <unk> it 's not we have no idea the mechanism 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 873.46 878.92 <NA> so the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 879.87 889.64 <NA> <unk> like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence chemotherapy may work by that same exact way the wild thing about that trial
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 889.64 896.38 <NA> also was that it reduced new primaries so new cancers by thirty percent also <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 898.29 904.43 <NA> so <unk> the problem is yours and mine all of our systems are changing

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 914.95 922.73 <NA> <unk> start to look at it that red that dark color there more than seventy five percent of the population of those countries are obese

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 928.23 937.74 <NA> so our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago <unk> so the diseases we have today <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 937.73 943.48 <NA> which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades are going to change
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 943.31 948.69 <NA> dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 959.37 966.07 <NA> <unk> of the whole proteome so this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet <unk> and
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 965.9 973.12 <NA> we 're able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body we can start to see that system <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 972.69 979.91 <NA> each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified the power of these magnets the power of what we can do here is that we

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 982.33 984.5 <NA> with this technology so 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 984.22 994.49 <NA> again this is stuff we 're doing with danny hillis and a group called applied proteomics <unk> where we can start to see individual neutron differences <unk> and we can start to look at <unk>
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 994.39 1001.09 <NA> <unk> that system like we never have before so instead of a reductionist view we 're taking a step back 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1005.02 1006.77 <NA> <unk> who had recurrent
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1006.77 1015.6 <NA> lung cancer <unk> it was in her brain in her lungs in her liver <unk> she had gotten carboplatin taxol carboplatin taxotere
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1017.46 1026.81 <NA> every drug we have she had gotten and that disease continued to grow she had three kids under the age of twelve 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1026.68 1029.37 <NA> and this is her ct scan and so what this is
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1029.93 1033.5 <NA> <unk> taking a cross section of her body here <unk> and you can see in the
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1033.28 1044.07 <NA> middle there is her heart and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her untreated in a matter of weeks 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1044.09 1046.92 <NA> she goes on a pill a day

DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1050.04 1060.07 <NA> <unk> and again i 'm not sure if this pathway was in the system in the cancer but it targeted a pathway <unk> and a month later pow that cancer 's gone 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1060.06 1063.1 <NA> six months later it 's still gone <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1062.61 1070.72 <NA> that cancer recurred and she passed away three years later from lung cancer <unk> but she got three years
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1070.71 1074.99 <NA> from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne that
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1077.86 1081.78 <NA> <unk> is that the clinical trial was done <unk> and we were a part of it 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1081.78 1088.37 <NA> and in the fundamental clinical trial the pivotal clinical trial we call the phase three we refused to use a placebo <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1088.33 1095.51 <NA> would you want your mother your brother your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1095.05 1103.91 <NA> and the answer obviously is not so it was done on this group of patients ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1105.04 1114.12 <NA> the drug went to the fda and the fda said without a placebo <unk> how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1114.23 1118.56 <NA> so the morning the fda was going to meet this was the
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1118.19 1124.93 <NA> editorial in the wall street journal and so what do you know that drug was approved
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1126.06 1140.18 <NA> <unk> the amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial where they gave half placebo and half the drug and we learned something important there what 's interesting is they did it in south america and canada where it 's more ethical to give placebos 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1140.18 1150.05 <NA> they had to give it also in the u s to get approval so i think there were three u s patients in upstate new york who were part of the trial but they did that and what they found is that seventy percent
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1152.47 1155.3 <NA> <unk> lived much longer and did better
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1154.9 1157.34 <NA> than people who got placebo 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1156.88 1166.16 <NA> so it challenged everything we knew in cancer is that you don 't need to get a response you don 't need to shrink the disease <unk> if we slow the disease <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1165.76 1175.02 <NA> we may have more of a benefit on patient survival patient outcome how they feel than if we shrink the disease <unk> the problem is that if
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1175 1183.31 <NA> i 'm this doc and i get your ct scan today and you 've got a two centimeter mass in your liver and you come back to me in three months and it 's three centimeters <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1183.31 1185.58 <NA> did that drug help you or not 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1185.51 1193.62 <NA> how do i know <unk> would it have been ten centimeters <unk> or am i giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1193.62 1199.92 <NA> so <unk> it 's a fundamental problem and again <unk> that 's where these new technologies
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1199.55 1204.67 <NA> can come in <unk> and so the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor 's office
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1204.93 1208.18 <NA> <unk> well <unk> the ultimate goal is is that you prevent disease <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1207.72 1214.18 <NA> right the ultimate goal is is that you prevent any of these things from happening that is the most effective
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1213.98 1217.38 <NA> cost effective best way we can do things today <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1217.38 1227.29 <NA> but if one is unfortunate to get a disease you 'll go into your doctor 's office he or she will take a drop of blood and we will start to know how to treat your disease <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1227.73 1229.13 <NA> the way
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1228.94 1229.94 <NA> we 've approached
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1229.93 1237.6 <NA> <unk> it is the field of proteomics again this looking at the system <unk> it 's taking a big picture <unk> the problem with technologies like this
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1237.42 1246.68 <NA> is that if one looks at proteins in the body <unk> there are eleven orders of magnitude difference between the <unk> high abundant and the low abundant proteins <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1246.25 1249.84 <NA> so there 's no technology in the world that can span eleven orders of
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1251.3 1264.63 <NA> <unk> and so a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles try to bring the software we can start to look at different components along this spectrum <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1264.5 1268.38 <NA> and so <unk> earlier was talked about cross discipline 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1268.38 1279.43 <NA> about collaboration <unk> and i think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in yesterday the national cancer institute announced a new program
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1280.14 1288.85 <NA> <unk> sciences and oncology where physicists <unk> mathematicians are brought in to think about cancer people who never approached it before 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1288.51 1293.8 <NA> danny and i got sixteen million dollars they announced yesterday to try to attach this problem 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1293.31 1299.48 <NA> a whole new approach <unk> instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1300.52 1305.12 <NA> <unk> to try to bring technology to get a picture of what 's actually happening
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1304.95 1306.53 <NA> in the body <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1306.25 1312.63 <NA> so <unk> just for two seconds how these technologies work because i think it 's important to understand it
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1312.63 1325.2 <NA> <unk> what happens is every protein in your body is charged <unk> so the proteins are sprayed in the magnet spins them around <unk> and then there 's a detector at the end when it hit that detector is dependent on the mass
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1327.08 1336.92 <NA> <unk> and so we can accurately if the magnet is big enough and your resolution is high enough you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1336.93 1343.35 <NA> of the individual system <unk> and so as a cancer doctor <unk> instead of having paper
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1343.13 1350.01 <NA> in my chart in your chart and it being this thick <unk> this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1349.73 1354.88 <NA> where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data electronic data elements are
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1354.81 1360.62 <NA> <unk> describing every aspect of the disease and certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1360.41 1363.13 <NA> and actually move forward <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1362.82 1370.99 <NA> instead of just having encounter and encounter <unk> without fundamental learning so to conclude <unk> 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1371.34 1376.81 <NA> we need to get away from reductionist thinking <unk> we need to start to think differently
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1376.38 1379.97 <NA> and radically and so i implore everyone here
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1379.75 1384.64 <NA> <unk> here think differently come up with new ideas tell them to me or anyone else in our field 
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1384.65 1394.56 <NA> because over the last fifty nine years <unk> nothing has changed <unk> we need a radically different approach <unk> you know andy grove stepped down as chairman of the board at intel
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1394.23 1396.47 <NA> and andy was one of my mentors
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1396.07 1404.94 <NA> <unk> tough individual when andy stepped down he said no technology will win technology itself will win and i 'm a firm believer in the field of medicine
DavidAgus_2009P 1 DavidAgus_2009P 1405.02 1413.05 <NA> <unk> and especially cancer that it 's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the
