RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 38.48 41.17 <NA> in a world that 's devoid of emotion <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 41.17 47.4 <NA> so i 'm on a mission to change that i want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 47.93 49.81 <NA> i started on this path
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 51.09 52.72 <NA> <unk> a computer scientist
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 52.49 57.82 <NA> in egypt and i had just gotten accepted to a ph d program at cambridge university <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 57.42 64.09 <NA> so i did something quite unusual for a young newlywed muslim egyptian wife 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 65.28 71.41 <NA> with the support of my husband who had to stay in egypt <unk> i packed my bags and i moved to england 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 71.1 79.61 <NA> at cambridge <unk> thousands of miles away from home <unk> i realized i was spending more hours with my laptop than i did with any other human
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 79.99 88.13 <NA> yet despite this intimacy my laptop had absolutely no idea how i was feeling <unk> it had no idea if i was happy
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 87.94 93.71 <NA> <unk> having a bad day or stressed confused and so that got frustrating <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 95.02 104.22 <NA> even worse as i communicated online with my family back home <unk> i felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 104.99 113.43 <NA> <unk> homesick i was lonely and on some days i was actually crying <unk> but all i had to communicate these emotions
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 113.21 114.99 <NA> was this 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 116.36 125.07 <NA> today 's technology has lots of i q but no e q lots of cognitive intelligence but no emotional intelligence <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 124.61 126.49 <NA> so that got me thinking
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 130.02 138.1 <NA> <unk> sense our emotions what if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 138.18 146.38 <NA> those questions led me and my team to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 146.04 149.53 <NA> and our starting point was the human face <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 150.06 154.82 <NA> so our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels that we all use to
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 154.75 163.97 <NA> <unk> communicate social and emotional states <unk> everything from enjoyment <unk> surprise <unk> empathy and curiosity 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 164.47 169.8 <NA> in emotion science we call each facial muscle movement an action unit 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 169.8 174.99 <NA> so for example action unit twelve it 's not a hollywood blockbuster <unk> it is
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 175 180.57 <NA> <unk> actually a lip corner pull which is the main component of a smile try it everybody let 's get some smiles going on 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 180.44 189.06 <NA> another example is action unit four it 's the brow furrow it 's when you draw your eyebrows together and you create all these textures and wrinkles we don 't like them
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 188.72 198.03 <NA> <unk> but it 's a strong indicator of a negative emotion <unk> so we have about forty five of these action units <unk> and they combine to express hundreds of emotions
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 197.63 204.97 <NA> <unk> teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard <unk> because these action units they can be fast they 're subtle
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 205.04 210.64 <NA> and they combine in many different ways <unk> so take for example the smile and the smirk 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 211.08 215.65 <NA> they look somewhat similar <unk> but they mean very different things 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 216.48 224.99 <NA> so the smile is positive a smirk is often negative <unk> sometimes a smirk can make you become famous <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 225.97 233.89 <NA> <unk> it 's important for a computer to be able to tell the difference between the two expressions <unk> so how do we do that we give our algorithms
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 233.73 243.62 <NA> tens of thousands of examples of people we know to be smiling from different ethnicities ages <unk> genders <unk> and we do the same for smirks <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 243.52 254.37 <NA> and then using deep learning the algorithm looks for all these textures and wrinkles and and shape changes on our face <unk> and basically learns that all smiles have common characteristics
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 255.02 257.44 <NA> <unk> smirks have subtly different characteristics <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 257.26 261.99 <NA> and the next time it sees a new face <unk> it essentially learns that
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 261.99 268.86 <NA> this face has the same characteristics of a smile and it says aha <unk> i recognize this this is a smile expression 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 270.05 278.53 <NA> so the best way to demonstrate how this technology works is to try a live demo <unk> so i need a volunteer preferably somebody with a face
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 281.25 283.84 <NA> 's going to be our volunteer today <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 284.76 296.08 <NA> so over the past five years we 've moved from being a research project at mit to a company <unk> where my team has worked really hard to make this technology work as we like to say in the wild <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 295.59 304.01 <NA> and we 've also shrunk it so that the core emotion engine works on any mobile device with a camera like this ipad <unk> so let 's give this a try
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 306.28 317.69 <NA> as you can see the algorithm has essentially found cloe 's face so it 's this white bounding box and it 's tracking the main feature points on her face <unk> so her eyebrows her eyes her mouth and her nose 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 317.26 324.08 <NA> the question is can it recognize her expression so we 're going to test the machine <unk> so first of all give me your poker face yep awesome 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 326.78 335.26 <NA> <unk> and then as she smiles this is a genuine smile it 's great so you can see the green bar go up as she smiles now that was a big smile can you try a subtle smile to see if the computer can recognize 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 335.26 339.39 <NA> it does recognize subtle smiles as well we 've worked really hard to make that happen
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 338.96 346.68 <NA> <unk> and then eyebrow raised indicator of surprise <unk> brow furrow <unk> which is an indicator of confusion 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 347.3 350.11 <NA> frown <unk> yes
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 351.66 356.89 <NA> <unk> so these are all the different action units there 's many more of them this is just a slimmed down demo <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 356.46 360.49 <NA> but we call each reading an emotion data point <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 360.06 369.43 <NA> and then they can fire together to portray different emotions so on the right side of the demo look like you 're happy <unk> so that 's joy joy fires up <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 368.97 374.54 <NA> and then give me a disgust face try to remember what it was like when zayn left one direction
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 381.82 390.53 <NA> <unk> the valence is actually quite negative so you must have been a big fan so valence is how positive or negative an experience is and engagement is how expressive she is as well 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 390.53 396.71 <NA> so imagine if cloe had access to this real time emotion stream and she could share it with anybody she wanted to 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 396.34 397.38 <NA> thank you
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 406.49 413.04 <NA> <unk> we have amassed twelve billion of these emotion data points it 's the largest emotion database in the world

RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 425.07 434.26 <NA> <unk> my mind away that we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions and we can do it at this scale <unk> so what have we learned to date <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 434.55 436.18 <NA> gender 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 436.83 440.56 <NA> our data confirms something that you might suspect <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 440.49 450.28 <NA> women are more expressive than men not only do they smile more their smiles last longer and we can now really quantify what it is that that men and women respond to differently 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 450.06 454.97 <NA> let 's do culture so in the united states women are forty percent more expressive
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 454.93 460.34 <NA> <unk> than men but curiously we don 't see any difference in the u k between men and women

RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 476.36 483.24 <NA> <unk> a necessity for dating <unk> but perhaps what surprised us the most about this data is that
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 482.78 491.7 <NA> we happen to be expressive all the time <unk> even when we are sitting in front of our devices alone <unk> and it 's not just when we 're watching cat videos on facebook

RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 580.74 593.26 <NA> our biggest challenge is that there are so many applications of this technology my team and i realize that we can 't build them all ourselves so we 've made this technology available so that other developers can get building and get creative <unk> 
RanaelKaliouby_2015W 1 RanaelKaliouby_2015W 593.1 596.65 <NA> we recognize that there are potential
