HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I 1 HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I 1130.98 1137.41 <NA> what i think it comes down to is a question of not only having information of what 's going on

HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I 1 HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I 1160.84 1172.73 <NA> we have that information but what often happens to us is that we don 't really choose to pay attention to it we don 't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts 
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I 1 HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I 1172.42 1174.93 <NA> so i think the way forward for the world
