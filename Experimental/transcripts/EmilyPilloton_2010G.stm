EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 204.84 209.86 <NA> <unk> sounds like i 'm painting a really bleak picture of this place but i promise there is good news <unk> 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 209.43 218.83 <NA> the biggest asset in my opinion one of the biggest assets in bertie county right now is this man this is dr chip zullinger fondly known as <unk> dr 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 218.37 225.23 <NA> z he was brought in in october two thousand and seven as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system

EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 242.5 250.62 <NA> so in february of two thousand and nine dr zullinger invited us project h design which is a non profit design firm that i founded
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 250.4 254.88 <NA> to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 254.84 263.28 <NA> <unk> design perspective to the repair of the school district and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 262.79 270.4 <NA> one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don 't usually have access to design services or creative capital 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 270.4 278.11 <NA> specifically we use these six design directives probably the most important being number two we design with not for in that
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 279.78 288.13 <NA> <unk> design it 's not about designing for clients anymore <unk> it 's about designing with people and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 288.15 296.15 <NA> so at the time of being invited down there we were based in san francisco <unk> and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of two thousand and nine
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 295.96 299.9 <NA> spending about half our time in bertie county and when i say we i mean project
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 300 306.89 <NA> but more specifically i mean myself and my partner matthew miller who 's an architect and a sort of macgyver type builder
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 306.7 314.52 <NA> <unk> so fast forward to today and we now live there i have strategically cut matt 's head out of this photo because he would kill me if he knew i was using it
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 314.34 316.79 <NA> because of the sweatsuits <unk> but
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 316.36 329.94 <NA> this is our front porch we live there <unk> we now call this place home over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth we realized we had fallen in love with the place we had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 329.9 335.71 <NA> <unk> we 're able to do in a rural place like bertie county that as designers and builders <unk> you can 't do everywhere
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 335.71 345.19 <NA> there 's space to experiment and to weld and to test things we have an amazing advocate in dr zullinger there 's a nobility of real
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 347.08 354.91 <NA> work but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there there is a huge need there is a total vacuum of creative capital in
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 354.84 362 <NA> <unk> bertie county there isn 't a single licensed architect in the whole county <unk> and so we we saw an opportunity to bring design as this
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 361.76 366.04 <NA> untouched tool something that bertie county didn 't otherwise have 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 365.61 375.2 <NA> and to be sort of the to usher that in as a new type of tool in in their tool kit the initial goal became using design within the public education system
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 375.31 381 <NA> <unk> in partnership with dr zullinger that was why we were there <unk> but beyond that we recognized that bertie county <unk> 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 381 387.66 <NA> as a community was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 387.24 398.87 <NA> and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking <unk> so the goal became <unk> yes to apply design within education but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development <unk> 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 398.53 400.08 <NA> so in order to do this
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 400.31 410.31 <NA> <unk> we 've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education and i should say that these are three things that we 've done in bertie county but i feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 410.08 414.18 <NA> rural communities around the u s and maybe even beyond <unk> 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 413.9 417.63 <NA> so the first of the three is design for education 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 417.63 429.97 <NA> this is the most kind of direct obvious intersection of the two things <unk> it 's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students this is in response
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 429.93 437.35 <NA> <unk> to the the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we 're building schools out of these days 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 437.52 445.6 <NA> and so this played out for us in a couple different ways the first was a series of renovations of computer labs so traditionally the computer labs <unk> 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 445.6 451.4 <NA> particularly in an under performing school like bertie county where they have to benchmark test every other week <unk> 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 451.19 452.45 <NA> the computer lab is a
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 454.96 457.71 <NA> <unk> come in you face the wall you take your test and you leave 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 457.71 471.87 <NA> so we wanted to change the way that students approach technology to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging more accessible and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology based instruction
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 471.66 479.97 <NA> so this is the lab at the high school and the principal there is in love with this room every time he has visitors it 's the first place that he takes them <unk> and this also meant the
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 479.78 490.41 <NA> <unk> the co creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape it allows elementary level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity <unk>
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 490.31 504.97 <NA> <unk> and running around and screaming and being a kid so this game that the kids are playing here in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called match me and in match me <unk> you take the class divide it into two teams one team on each side of the playground and the teacher will take a piece of chalk
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 505.11 507.7 <NA> <unk> and just write a number on each of the tires 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 507.27 518.68 <NA> and then she 'll call out a math problem so let 's say four times four and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is sixteen and find the tire with the sixteen on it and sit on it 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 518.68 523.15 <NA> so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 523.05 529.97 <NA> and the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 529.78 537.59 <NA> <unk> scores a greater comfort level with the material especially with the boys that in going outside and playing they aren 't afraid to take on
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 537.59 540.6 <NA> a double digit multiplication problem
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 540.15 547.97 <NA> and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material <unk> 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 547.96 554.76 <NA> so with design for education i think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 554.93 557.79 <NA> <unk> they have the incentive and the desire to use them
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 557.33 560.46 <NA> so this is mr perry he 's the assistant superintendent he
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 560.46 567.03 <NA> came out for one of our teacher training days and won like five rounds of match me in a row and was very proud of himself 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 567.89 575.05 <NA> laughter so the second approach is redesigning education itself this is the most complex <unk> it 's a
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 576.54 587.48 <NA> <unk> how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 587.48 592.97 <NA> and the incentive to want to make change which is easier said than done in rural communities and in
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 592.52 596.95 <NA> in inside the box education systems in rural communities <unk> 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 596.61 604.97 <NA> so for us this was a graphic public campaign called connect bertie there are thousands of these blue dots all over the county <unk> and this was for a fund
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 605.04 613.34 <NA> that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 612.94 627.12 <NA> right now i should say there are only ten percent of of the houses that actually have an in home internet connection and the only places to get wifi are in the school buildings or at the bojangles fried chicken joint <unk> which i find myself squatting outside of a lot
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 630.1 640.23 <NA> wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place <unk> it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community it asked them <unk>

EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 658.03 662.42 <NA> and then the third approach which is what i 'm most excited about which is where we are now 
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 662.23 675.14 <NA> is design as education so design as education means that we could actually teach design within public schools and not design based learning not like let 's learn physics by building a rocket but actually
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 676.69 682.73 <NA> <unk> coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 682.39 692.66 <NA> <unk> it also means that designers are no longer consultants but we 're teachers and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation and what design offers <unk>
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 692.56 700.56 <NA> <unk> as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring <unk> rigid <unk> verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by

EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 709.31 722.37 <NA> so we started thinking about the the legacy of shop class and how shop class wood and metal shop class in particular historically has been something intended for kids who aren 't going to go to college <unk> it 's a vocational training path <unk>
EmilyPilloton_2010G 1 EmilyPilloton_2010G 725 728.93 <NA> projects are things like let 's make a birdhouse for your mom for christmas
