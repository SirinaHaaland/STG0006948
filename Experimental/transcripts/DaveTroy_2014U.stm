DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 12.64 17.2 <NA> <unk> when we think about mapping cities we tend to think about roads and streets and buildings <unk> 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 17.2 23.27 <NA> and the settlement narrative that led to their creation or you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer <unk> 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 22.9 29.94 <NA> but there 's other ways to think about mapping cities and how they got to be made <unk> today i want to show you a new kind of map this is
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 29.87 35.47 <NA> <unk> not a geographic map this is a map of the relationships between people in my hometown of baltimore maryland <unk> 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 35.47 47.2 <NA> and what you can see here is that each dot represents a person each line represents a relationship between those people and each color represents a community within the network <unk> 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 46.97 49.93 <NA> now i 'm here on the green side down on the far right
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 57.3 64.72 <NA> <unk> side of the network you tend to have primarily <unk> african american and latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 64.23 74.74 <NA> but just to give some sense the green part of the network we call smalltimore for those of us that inhabit it because it seems as though we 're living in a very small town we see the same people over and over again 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 74.74 79.82 <NA> but that 's because we 're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 80.11 90.56 <NA> <unk> on the other end of the network you have folks who are interested in things like hip hop music and they even identify with living in the dc maryland virginia area over say the baltimore
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 90.34 93.26 <NA> city designation proper <unk> 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 92.95 104.55 <NA> but in the middle you see that there 's something that connects the two communities together and that 's sports we have the baltimore orioles the baltimore ravens football team michael phelps the olympian under armour you may have heard of
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 104.93 110.31 <NA> <unk> baltimore company and that community of sports acts as the only bridge between these two ends of the network <unk> 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 110.03 115.5 <NA> let 's take a look at san francisco you see something a little bit different happening in san francisco
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 115.4 119.8 <NA> <unk> on the one hand you do have the media politics and news
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 119.61 126.79 <NA> lobe that tends to exist in baltimore and other cities <unk> but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 126.55 129.97 <NA> sort of taking over the top half of the network <unk> and there 's even a group
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 130.05 139.66 <NA> <unk> that 's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as twitter employees next to the geeks <unk> in between the gamers and the geeks at the opposite end of the hip hop spectrum
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 139.35 142.48 <NA> <unk> so you can see though that
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 142.05 148.22 <NA> the tensions that we 've heard about in san francisco in terms of people being concerned about gentrification and
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 148.22 154.46 <NA> all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth and settlement into the city are real and you can actually see that documented here
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 154.93 160.22 <NA> <unk> you can see the lgbt community is not really getting along with the geek community that well
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 159.79 164.58 <NA> the arts community the music community <unk> and so it leads to things like this [ evict twitter ]
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 164.58 173.93 <NA> somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago <unk> and it shows what is happening on the ground in san francisco and i think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this let
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 173.44 174.78 <NA> 's take a look at rio de
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 175.4 180.22 <NA> <unk> i spent the last few weeks gathering data about rio and one of the things that stood out to me about this city
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 179.98 190.11 <NA> is that everything 's really kind of mixed up it 's a very heterogenous city in a way that baltimore or san francisco is not you still have the lobe of people involved with government <unk>
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 190.06 202.53 <NA> newspapers politics columnists tedxrio is down in the lower right right next to bloggers and writers but then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music even justin bieber fans are represented here
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 205.32 212.44 <NA> gospel music funk and rap and stand up comedy and there 's even a whole section around drugs and jokes how cool is that 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 212.07 223.82 <NA> and then the flamengo football team is also represented here so you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music but it 's represented in a very different way and i think that
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 223.82 229.91 <NA> maybe fits with our understanding of rio as being a very multicultural <unk> musically diverse city
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 230.35 231.89 <NA> so
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 232.57 240.56 <NA> we have all this data it 's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now maybe even richer than any data set that we 've ever had before
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 240.28 250.11 <NA> <unk> so what can we do with it <unk> well i think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct it 's something that we choose to do and we could choose not
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 251.6 262.89 <NA> <unk> you kind of think about it what we 're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city and looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria <unk> and seeing <unk> how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 262.89 266.28 <NA> well maybe it 's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 266.09 268.42 <NA> the other thing that we start to realize
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 268.25 274.99 <NA> is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity we 've got people represented from all different types of races across the
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 278.34 289.93 <NA> <unk> only looking at race doesn 't really contribute to our development of diversity so if we 're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems we need to start to think about diversity in a new way <unk> 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 289.65 293.32 <NA> and lastly we have the ability to create
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 292.89 302.05 <NA> interventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way <unk> and i believe that if we have that capability we may even bear some responsibility to do so 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 301.77 304.91 <NA> so what is a city <unk> i think some might say that it
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 304.96 306 <NA> <unk> a
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 305.5 313.31 <NA> geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings <unk> but i believe that a city is the sum of the relationships of the people that live there <unk> 
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 312.94 314.81 <NA> and i believe that
DaveTroy_2014U 1 DaveTroy_2014U 315.91 324.33 <NA> if we can start to document those relationships in a real way then maybe we have a real shot at creating those kinds of cities that we 'd like to have thank you
