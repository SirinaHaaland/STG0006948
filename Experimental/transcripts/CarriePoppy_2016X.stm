CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 387.85 395.6 <NA> <unk> mean there 's no such thing as a mystery of course there are mysteries <unk> but a mystery is a mystery <unk> it is not a ghost <unk> 
CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 395.89 400.05 <NA> now <unk> i believe there are two kinds of truth
CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 400.52 410.05 <NA> <unk> me a while to get to this place <unk> but i think this is right so hear me out i think there is outer truth and there 's inner truth <unk> so
CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 409.87 411.9 <NA> if you say to me 
CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 411.68 414.64 <NA> there was a man named jesus and he once existed 
CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 414.4 421.11 <NA> that 's outer truth right <unk> and we can go and look at the historical record we can determine whether that seems to be true <unk> 
CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 421.1 423.75 <NA> and i would argue <unk> it does seem to be true

CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 459.42 470.49 <NA> now you 've moved it from outer truth to inner truth from science to art <unk> and i think we have a tendency to not be clear about this to try to move our inner truths to outer truths 
CarriePoppy_2016X 1 CarriePoppy_2016X 470.49 477.93 <NA> or to not be fair about it to each other and when people are telling us their inner truths to try to make them defend them by
