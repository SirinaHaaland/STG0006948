JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 67.56 73.06 <NA> and i mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what those people are about 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 73.06 76.69 <NA> and that 's kind of where i see what my job is and what our team 's job is <unk> 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 77.94 79.76 <NA> our research often starts with

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 121.88 129.94 <NA> so i 've probably done about five years ' research looking at what people carry <unk> i go in people 's bags i look in people 's pockets

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 151.03 156.14 <NA> <unk> but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 156.07 162.29 <NA> across cultures and across gender and across contexts most people will say

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 177.62 183.24 <NA> <unk> it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask but really the question is why right <unk> 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 183.05 187.77 <NA> so why are these things so important in our lives <unk> and it turns out 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 187.82 193.71 <NA> from our research that it boils down to survival survival for us and survival for our loved ones <unk> 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 193.64 200.05 <NA> so <unk> keys provide an access to shelter and warmth transport as well

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 227.44 235.31 <NA> <unk> in particular it 's the mobile phone 's ability to allow people to transcend space and time and what i mean by that is you know

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 245.44 254.19 <NA> and this is fairly universally appreciated it turns out <unk> which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected and they value that connectivity
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 255.32 259.32 <NA> <unk> but actually you can do this kind of stuff with pcs and you can do them with phone kiosks <unk> 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 259.94 262.5 <NA> and the mobile phone in addition 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 262.19 270.9 <NA> is both personal and so it also gives you a degree of privacy and it 's convenient you don 't need to ask permission from anyone you can just go ahead and do it right
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 272.57 278.44 <NA> however for these things to help us survive it depends on them being carried
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 280.32 282.13 <NA> <unk> and it 's a pretty big but
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 282.48 288.04 <NA> we forget we 're human that 's what we do it 's one of our features i think quite a nice feature

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 370.14 376.57 <NA> and from a design perspective <unk> it 's about understanding what you can delegate to technology
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 376.29 379.94 <NA> and what you can delegate to other people and
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 379.99 385.4 <NA> <unk> turns out delegation if you want it to be can be the solution for pretty much everything 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 385.78 393.47 <NA> apart from things like bodily functions going to the toilet you can 't ask someone to do that on your behalf <unk> and apart from things like entertainment <unk>

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 406.37 413.07 <NA> this is probably the thing i 'm most passionate about is the research that we 've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 413.07 416.88 <NA> so the u n estimated this is two thousand and four figures
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 416.45 426.18 <NA> that there are almost eight hundred million people who can 't read and write worldwide so we 've been conducting a lot of research <unk> and
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 425.84 429.94 <NA> one of the things we were looking at is if you can 't read and write
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 430.01 433.69 <NA> <unk> if you want to communicate over distances <unk> you need to be
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 433.49 437.38 <NA> able to identify the person that you want to communicate with it
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 437.16 443.83 <NA> could be a phone number it could be an e mail address it could be a postal address simple question if you can 't read and write how do you manage your contact information 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 443.46 447.1 <NA> and the fact is that millions of people do it 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 446.76 454.7 <NA> just from a design perspective we didn 't really understand how they did it and so that 's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 455.38 462.24 <NA> and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation <unk> so they delegate that part of the task process
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 462.24 465.29 <NA> to other people the stuff that they can 't do themselves
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 465.46 475.05 <NA> let me give you another example of delegation this one 's a little bit more sophisticated <unk> and this is from a study that we did in uganda about how people who are sharing devices <unk> use those
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 476.63 482.91 <NA> <unk> sente is a word in uganda that means money <unk> it has a second meaning which is to send money as airtime <unk>

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 505.2 508.57 <NA> so what i do is i buy a prepaid card like this 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 508.56 514.66 <NA> and instead of using that that money to top up my own phone i call up the local village operator <unk> 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 514.29 522.73 <NA> and i read out that number to them <unk> and they use it to top up their phone so they 're topping up the value from kampala and it 's now being topped up in the village <unk> 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 522.57 529.82 <NA> you take a ten or twenty percent commission <unk> and then you the kiosk operator takes ten or twenty percent commission and
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 529.75 539.39 <NA> <unk> passes the rest over to you in cash ok there 's two things i like about this <unk> so the first is <unk> it turns anyone
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 539.22 549.39 <NA> who has access to a mobile phone anyone who has a mobile phone essentially into an atm machine it brings rudimentary banking services to places where there 's no banking infrastructure <unk>

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 558.14 560.82 <NA> there 's a second thing i like about this 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 560.33 571.86 <NA> and that is that despite all the resources at my disposal <unk> and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication i know i could never have designed something as elegant and as

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 579.57 586.99 <NA> <unk> but the difference between this and that is <unk> there 's no central authority trying to control this <unk> this is just street up innovation 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 589.23 594.94 <NA> so it turns out the street is a never ending source of inspiration for us 
JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 594.72 600.05 <NA> and ok if you break one of these things here you return it to the carrier they 'll give you

JanChipchase_2007 1 JanChipchase_2007 644.42 651.42 <NA> but what i like about this is <unk> it boils down to someone on the street with a small flat surface
