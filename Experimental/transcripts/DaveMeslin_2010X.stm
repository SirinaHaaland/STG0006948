DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 85.02 99.9 <NA> whereas the city of toronto clearly doesn 't want you involved with the planning process otherwise their ads would look something like this with all the information laid out clearly <unk> as long as the city 's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged then of course people aren 't going to be engaged <unk> but that 's not
DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 108.47 117.91 <NA> <unk> the manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we 've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression <unk>

DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 219.54 224.99 <NA> heroes how do we view leadership look at these ten movies what do they have in common

DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 293.1 295.1 <NA> <unk> uninspiring
DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 294.87 304.97 <NA> and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear

DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 333.89 335.49 <NA> our elections 
DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 335.49 347.05 <NA> as you may have noticed our elections in canada are a complete joke we use out of date systems that are unfair and create random results canada 's currently led by a party that most canadians didn 't actually want how

DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 392.09 394.04 <NA> my main message is 
DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 393.61 400.17 <NA> if we can redefine apathy not as some kind of internal syndrome <unk> but as a complex web of cultural barriers
DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 400.88 402.99 <NA> <unk> reinforces disengagement 
DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 402.8 408.81 <NA> and if we can clearly define clearly identify what those obstacles are <unk> 
DaveMeslin_2010X 1 DaveMeslin_2010X 408.38 414.1 <NA> and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles then anything is possible thank you
