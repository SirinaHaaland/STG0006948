StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 125.21 127.47 <NA> it 's really from knowledge 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 127.97 129.94 <NA> if you look fifty years into the

StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 191.48 198.51 <NA> it 's fusion <unk> but there is a catch of course there is always a catch in these cases fusion is very hard to do <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 198.5 201.24 <NA> we 've been trying for fifty years
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 201.62 204.73 <NA> okay what is fusion here comes the nuclear physics
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 205.01 208.54 <NA> sorry about that but this is what turns me on 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 209.91 212.92 <NA> i was a strange child <unk>
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 215.4 224.2 <NA> nuclear energy comes for a simple reason the most stable nucleus is iron <unk> right in the middle of the periodic table <unk> it 's a medium sized nucleus <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 225 226.49 <NA> <unk> go towards iron
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 226.29 230.87 <NA> if you want to get energy so uranium which is very big wants to split <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 230.92 238.64 <NA> but small atoms want to join together small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 238.33 243.74 <NA> and you can get energy out this way and indeed that 's exactly what stars do in the middle of stars 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 243.74 252.17 <NA> you 're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon to make oxygen all the things that you 're made of are made in the middle of stars <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 253.15 254.97 <NA> but it 's a hard process to do
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 254.84 263.55 <NA> <unk> do because as you know the middle of a star is quite hot <unk> almost by definition <unk> and there is one
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 263.55 265.11 <NA> reaction
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 264.98 269.04 <NA> that 's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 269.48 275.26 <NA> it 's between two isotopes of of hydrogen two kinds of hydrogen <unk> deuterium
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 275.22 281.53 <NA> <unk> which is heavy hydrogen <unk> which you can get from seawater and tritium which is super heavy hydrogen 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 282.69 289.63 <NA> these two nuclei when they 're far apart are charged <unk> and you push them together and they repel <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 289.44 295.78 <NA> but when you get them close enough something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 295.98 304.91 <NA> so most of the time they repel you get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together for a moment they become helium
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 304.84 310.86 <NA> <unk> five because they 've got five particles inside them so that 's that process there deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium five 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 310.86 315.56 <NA> helium splits out and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 315.16 324.87 <NA> if you can get something to about one hundred and fifty million degrees <unk> things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 325.79 335.49 <NA> <unk> and it will release energy <unk> and that energy is what powers fusion <unk> and it 's this reaction that we want to do there is one
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 335.39 343.98 <NA> trickiness about this reaction well there is a trickiness that you have to make it one hundred and fifty million degrees but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet it 's pretty hot 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 344.9 349.93 <NA> the trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn 't exist in nature you have to
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 350 357.48 <NA> <unk> make it from something else <unk> and you make if from lithium that reaction at the bottom that 's lithium six <unk> plus a neutron 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 357.49 360.73 <NA> will give you more helium <unk> plus tritium <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 360.27 367.9 <NA> and that 's the way you make your tritium <unk> but fortunately if you can do this fusion reaction you 've got a neutron <unk> so you can make that happen 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 368.19 377.39 <NA> now why the hell would we bother to do this this is basically why we would bother to do it if you just plot
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 377.17 379.97 <NA> how much fuel we 've got left
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 380.07 383.17 <NA> <unk> in units of present world consumption <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 383.18 394.59 <NA> and as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil the the blue line by the way is the lowest estimate of existing resources and the yellow line is the most optimistic
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 394.4 399.99 <NA> estimate <unk> and as you go across there you will see that we 've got a few tens of years and perhaps one hundred years of

StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 401.51 408.84 <NA> and god knows we don 't really want to burn all of it because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air <unk> and then we get to uranium <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 408.59 413.46 <NA> and with current reactor technology we really don 't have very much uranium <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 413.33 418.96 <NA> and we will have to extract uranium from sea water which is the yellow line to make
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 418.77 427.62 <NA> conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us this is a bit shocking because in fact our government is relying on that for us to
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 427.13 429.82 <NA> meet kyoto and do all those kind of things
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 429.99 433.99 <NA> <unk> go any further you would have to have breeder technology and breeder technology
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 433.5 439.96 <NA> is fast breeders and that 's pretty dangerous the big thing on the right is the lithium we have in the world <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 439.65 449.84 <NA> and lithium is in sea water that 's the yellow line <unk> and we have thirty million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water <unk> everybody can get it that 's why we want to do
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 453.07 458.88 <NA> <unk> we make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant <unk> and we get within
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 458.7 467.39 <NA> about the same price as current electricity so how would we make it we have to hold something at one hundred and fifty million degrees <unk> 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 467.14 469.01 <NA> and in fact 
StevenCowley_2009G 1 StevenCowley_2009G 468.88 475.05 <NA> we 've done this we hold it with a magnetic field and inside it right in the middle of this
