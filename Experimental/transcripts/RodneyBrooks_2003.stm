RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 570.67 579.91 <NA> for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system because what it pays attention to is what it 's seeing and interacting with and what

RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 594.3 603.62 <NA> colorings it looks for highly saturated colors from toys and it looks for things that move around and it weights those together into an attention window and it looks for the
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 604.87 610.53 <NA> <unk> place the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening and that is what its eyes then segue

RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 643.1 650.08 <NA> this is a habituation gaussian that gets negative and more and more intense as it looks at one thing and it gets
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 650.7 656.21 <NA> <unk> so it will then look away at something else so <unk> once you 've got that and here 's a robot here

RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 786.98 792.82 <NA> <unk> here they 're asked to prohibit the robot and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 811.89 819.61 <NA> <unk> we put that together then we put in turn taking when we talk to someone we talk then we sort of raise our eyebrows <unk> 
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 819.6 827.35 <NA> move our eyes give the other person the idea it 's their turn to talk <unk> and then they talk and then we pass the baton back and forth
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 826.89 829.97 <NA> between each between each other so we put this
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 829.99 840.41 <NA> <unk> in the robot we got a bunch of naive subjects in we didn 't tell them anything about the robot <unk> sat them down in front of the robot and said talk to the robot <unk> now what they didn 't know was the robot wasn 't understanding a word they said <unk> 
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 839.95 850.02 <NA> and that the robot wasn 't speaking english it was just saying random english phonemes and i want you to watch carefully at the beginning of this where this person ritchie who happened to talk to the robot
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 855.38 858.93 <NA> <unk> i want to show you my watch and he brings
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 858.59 869.1 <NA> the watch center into the robot 's field of vision points to it gives it a motion cue and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully we don 't know whether he understood or not that the robot
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 870.18 871.18 <NA> notice the
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 893.79 899.96 <NA> <unk> and they successfully have that sort of communication <unk> and here 's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 905.16 912.62 <NA> christie looks over at this toy <unk> the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she 's looking at 
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 912.64 915.98 <NA> so we 're going to see more and more of this sort of robot
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 915.58 922.49 <NA> over the next few years in in labs <unk> but then the big questions two big questions that people ask me are 
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 922.21 929.04 <NA> if we make these robots more and more human like will we accept them will we will they need rights
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 928.81 929.91 <NA> eventually
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 930.02 933.87 <NA> <unk> and the other question people ask me is will they want to take over 
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 933.86 940.33 <NA> and on the first you know this has been a very hollywood theme with lots of movies you probably recognize these characters here
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 939.85 947.61 <NA> where in each of these cases the robots want more respect <unk> well do you ever need to give robots respect they
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 947.45 954.94 <NA> 're just machines after all <unk> but i think you know we have to accept that we are just machines after all

RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 985.72 993.02 <NA> alive as we are <unk> but i think for us to admit that we have to give up on our special ness in a certain way and we 've had the
RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 993.01 1003.49 <NA> retreat from special ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years at least <unk> five hundred years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe

RodneyBrooks_2003 1 RodneyBrooks_2003 1029.81 1039.36 <NA> <unk> so you know having the idea that robots could really have emotions or that robots could be living creatures i think is going to be hard for us to accept <unk> but we 're going to come to accept it over the next
