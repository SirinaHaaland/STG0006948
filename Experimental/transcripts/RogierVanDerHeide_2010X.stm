RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 655.67 664.96 <NA> these main questions how do people move through these new urban spaces how do they share their culture how do we tackle things like mobility 
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 664.53 673.63 <NA> and how can light help there because the new technologies they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 673.38 674.99 <NA> of urbanization and
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 675.28 677.93 <NA> <unk> provide us with better environments

RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 687.04 696.74 <NA> now we have led but here you see the latest one and you see how incredibly small it is and this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity 
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 696.25 697.77 <NA> because
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 697.58 704.97 <NA> this tiny tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it and we can actually leave it out where it 's not needed at all
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 704.96 711.6 <NA> <unk> and where we can preserve darkness <unk> so that is a really interesting proposition i think <unk> and a new way of lighting

RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 715.07 724.99 <NA> the problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works but i can have four of these on my finger <unk> so you would not be able to really see them <unk> so i asked
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 725 735.08 <NA> <unk> our laboratory to do something about it and they said well we can do something they created for me the biggest led in the world especially for tedx in amsterdam <unk> so here it is

RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 751.93 760.01 <NA> <unk> this is not very pleasant and comfortable and for that reason we cover the led with

RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 763.96 773.47 <NA> and makes the light white and warm and pleasant and then when you add the lens to that you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 773.47 779.09 <NA> without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else <unk> so you can preserve the darkness

RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 779.95 785.19 <NA> i just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works thank you 
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 788.21 794.7 <NA> we can go further <unk> so we have to rethink the way we light our cities we have to think
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 794.57 799.69 <NA> again about light as a default solution why are all these motorways
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 801.39 806.74 <NA> <unk> can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness 
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 806.31 811.84 <NA> can we be much more gentle with light <unk> like here this is a very low light level actually 
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 1 RogierVanDerHeide_2010X 811.35 817.88 <NA> can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create so they really want to connect with it like here <unk>
