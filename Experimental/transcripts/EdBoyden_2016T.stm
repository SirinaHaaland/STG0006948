EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 363.6 374.89 <NA> <unk> you 've got the idea that this is a very very interesting molecule <unk> and if can use it in the right way we might be able to really zoom in on the brain in a way that you can 't do with past technologies <unk> 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 379.9 383.69 <NA> <unk> you could zoom in it might look something like what you see on the screen 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 383.32 391.73 <NA> polymers are chains of atoms arranged in long thin lines <unk> the chains are very tiny <unk> about the width of a biomolecule

EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 397.98 403.47 <NA> this is very good because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain if we add water what will happen is
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 404.93 411.45 <NA> <unk> absorb the water <unk> the polymer chains will move apart from each other <unk> and the entire material is going to become bigger <unk>

EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 419.48 429.94 <NA> here 's the mystery then how do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain so we can move all the biomolecules apart <unk> if we could do that maybe we could get ground truth maps of the
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 429.87 435.55 <NA> <unk> brain <unk> we could look at the wiring we can peer inside and see the molecules within

EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 453.13 457.56 <NA> <unk> we need to pull the molecules of the brain apart from each other <unk> and to do that we need to have a little

EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 462.76 468.11 <NA> now <unk> if you just take baby diaper polymer and dump it on the brain obviously it 's going to sit there on top <unk>

EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 484.79 494.28 <NA> they 're going to wind their way around biomolecules and between biomolecules forming those complex webs that will allow you eventually to pull apart the molecules from each other <unk>

EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 504.92 510.91 <NA> we have to treat this specimen with a chemical to kind of loosen up all the molecules from each other <unk> 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 510.91 520.4 <NA> and then when we add water that swellable material is going to start absorbing the water <unk> the polymer chains will move apart <unk> but now <unk> the biomolecules will come along for the ride <unk> 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 520.19 525.08 <NA> and much like drawing a picture on a balloon <unk> and then you blow up the balloon <unk> the image is the same
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 525.43 531.2 <NA> <unk> but the ink particles have moved away from each other <unk> and that 's what we 've been able to do now <unk> but in three dimensions there
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 531.04 533.45 <NA> 's one last trick 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 533.11 538.91 <NA> as you can see here we 've color coded all the biomolecules brown that 's because they all kind of look the same 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 538.91 546.81 <NA> biomolecules are made out of the same atoms but just in different orders <unk> so we need one last thing in order to make them visible <unk> 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 546.57 554.67 <NA> we have to bring in little tags with glowing dyes that will distinguish them so one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color <unk> another kind of
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 555.2 557.67 <NA> <unk> might get a red color <unk> and so forth <unk> 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 557.3 559.15 <NA> and that 's the final step 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 559.15 567.45 <NA> now we can look at something like a brain and look at the individual molecules because we 've moved them far apart enough from each other that we can tell them apart <unk> 
EdBoyden_2016T 1 EdBoyden_2016T 567.44 575.2 <NA> so the hope here is that we can make the invisible visible we can turn things that might seem small and obscure and blow them up until they 're like constellations
