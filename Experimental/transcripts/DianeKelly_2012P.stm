DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 12.31 17.74 <NA> <unk> when i go to parties <unk> it doesn 't usually take very long for people to find out that i 'm a scientist
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 17.74 22.74 <NA> and i study sex and then i get asked
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 22.56 28.77 <NA> questions <unk> and the questions usually have a very particular format they start with the phrase
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 29.96 32.97 <NA> <unk> me and then they end with the phrase is this
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 32.63 34.23 <NA> true 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 34.31 45.27 <NA> and most of the time i 'm glad to say that i can answer them but sometimes i have to say i 'm really sorry but i don 't know because i 'm not that kind of a doctor 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 45.08 54.97 <NA> that is i 'm not a clinician <unk> i 'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 55.08 62.41 <NA> <unk> their tissues and organs work when everything 's going right <unk> rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong like so many of you <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 62.41 71.71 <NA> and what i do is i look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they 've evolved for fundamental biological problems <unk> so today i 'm here to argue that this is <unk>
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 73.47 75.23 <NA> <unk> not at all an esoteric
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 75 77.95 <NA> ivory tower activity that we find at our universities 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 77.76 87.57 <NA> but that broad study across species tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 87.57 99.47 <NA> and this is true both of my recent project on sex differences in the brain <unk> and my more mature work on the anatomy and function of penises <unk> and now you know why i 'm fun at parties 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 99.31 104.6 <NA> so today i 'm going to give you an example drawn from my penis study
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 104.96 117.57 <NA> <unk> you how knowledge drawn from studies of one organ system provided insights into a very different one now i 'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows i did have to explain it to my nine year old late last week
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 117.56 129.97 <NA> penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another <unk> and the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals there 's an enormous amount of anatomical variation you
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 129.93 139.46 <NA> <unk> find muscular tubes modified legs modified fins as well as the mammalian fleshy <unk> inflatable cylinder that we 're all familiar with or at least
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 139.46 141.25 <NA> half of you are 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 142.89 154.82 <NA> and i think we see this tremendous variation because it 's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem <unk> and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 154.81 156.35 <NA> <unk> eggs and form zygotes 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 156.35 165.08 <NA> now the penis isn 't actually required for internal fertiliztion but when internal fertilization evolves penises often follow
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 165.13 174.81 <NA> <unk> and the question i get when i start talking about this most often is what made you interested in this subject and the answer is
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 176.27 180.75 <NA> <unk> you wouldn 't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 180.75 186.52 <NA> and that 's because we tend to think of skeletons as stiff lever systems that produce speed or power <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 186.34 194.64 <NA> and my first forays into biological research doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate were really squarely in that realm <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 194.15 202.51 <NA> but when i went to graduate school to study biomechanics <unk> i really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 202.51 204.97 <NA> i tried a bunch of different stuff a lot
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 204.99 209.64 <NA> <unk> it didn 't pan out but then one day i started thinking about the mammalian penis 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 209.45 219.88 <NA> and it 's really an odd sort of structure before it can be used for internal fertilization its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion most <unk>
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 219.78 229.97 <NA> <unk> of the time it 's a flexible organ it 's easy to bend <unk> but before it 's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid it has to become difficult to bend
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 230.07 235.97 <NA> and moreover it has to work <unk> a reproductive system that fails to function
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 235.48 241.76 <NA> produces an individual that has no offspring and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 241.78 247.34 <NA> <unk> and so i thought here 's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 247.15 253.88 <NA> not one like this one but one like this one
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 253.97 254.97 <NA> because
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 255.02 265.47 <NA> <unk> functionally a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces <unk> and i already knew that animals like this earthworm <unk> indeed most animals don 't support <unk>
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 265.37 270.88 <NA> <unk> their tissues by draping them over bones instead they 're more like reinforced water balloons 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 279.69 290.98 <NA> <unk> interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that 's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins <unk> and the interaction is crucial
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 290.76 298.01 <NA> <unk> without both elements you have no support if you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 297.83 300.05 <NA> pressure up you have a puddle
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 300.58 309.8 <NA> <unk> and if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension you 've got a little wet rag when you look at a penis in cross section <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 309.37 319.17 <NA> it has a lot of the hallmarks of a hydrostatic skeleton <unk> it has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid in this case blood
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 318.72 325.1 <NA> surrounded by a wall of tissue that 's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 325.09 329.97 <NA> but at the time when i started this project the best explanation i could find for
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 329.9 331.14 <NA> <unk> penal erection
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 330.94 340.14 <NA> was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila it became erect
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 340.31 346.42 <NA> <unk> and that explained to me expansion made sense more fluid you get
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 346.24 348.04 <NA> tissues that expand
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 347.83 350.38 <NA> but it didn 't actually explain erection
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 354.21 357.94 <NA> <unk> in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 357.66 365.83 <NA> and no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue so i thought wall tissue 's important in skeletons it has to be part of the explanation <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 365.58 375.02 <NA> and this was the point at which my graduate adviser said whoa <unk> hold on slow down because
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 375.49 381.92 <NA> <unk> after about six months of me talking about this i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the penis thing 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 384.16 391.75 <NA> so he sat me down <unk> and he warned me he was like be careful going down this path i 'm not sure this project 's going to pan out 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 391.75 394.58 <NA> because he was afraid i was walking into a trap
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 394.72 399.47 <NA> <unk> i was taking on a socially embarrassing question
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 399.19 404.97 <NA> with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting <unk> and that was because
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 405.25 419.46 <NA> every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements <unk> it had the central fluid <unk> it had the surrounding wall and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 419.12 429.97 <NA> around the long axis of the skeleton so the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you 're looking at the surface of the wall the arrow shows you the
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 429.93 440.11 <NA> <unk> long axis and you can see two layers of fibers one in blue and one in yellow <unk> arranged in left handed and right handed angles and if you weren 't just looking at a little section of the fibers those fibers <unk>
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 440.01 447.62 <NA> <unk> would be going in helices around the long axis of the skeleton something like a chinese finger trap where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 451.06 456.21 <NA> <unk> which i 'm going to demonstrate in a film it 's a model skeleton that i made out of a piece of cloth
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 456 464.06 <NA> that i wrapped around an inflated balloon the cloth 's cut on the bias so you can see that the fibers wrap in helices 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 463.57 474.35 <NA> and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves <unk> which means the skeleton 's flexible it lengthens <unk> shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 474.58 479.91 <NA> now my adviser 's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 479.78 485.58 <NA> <unk> skeleton what are you going to contribute what new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 485.21 493.11 <NA> and i thought yeah he does have a really good point here so i spent a long long time thinking about it and one thing kept bothering me <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 493.11 496.77 <NA> and that 's when they 're functioning penises don 't wiggle 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 497.57 502.99 <NA> laughter so something interesting had to be going on so i
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 504.87 507.58 <NA> <unk> wall tissue prepared it so it was erect <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 507.24 515.44 <NA> sectioned it put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 515.22 525.08 <NA> of some variety but instead i saw this there 's an outer layer and an inner layer the arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 525.82 531.23 <NA> <unk> i was really surprised at this everyone i showed it was really surprised at this why was everyone surprised at this 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 531.03 541.55 <NA> that 's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a in a hydrostatic skeleton <unk> and that was with fibers <unk>
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 541.5 545.48 <NA> at zero degrees and ninety degrees to the long axis of the structure 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 546.76 554.94 <NA> the thing is no one had ever seen it before in nature and now i was looking at one those fibers in that particular orientation
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 555.19 561.93 <NA> give the skeleton a very very different behavior i 'm going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 561.47 567.21 <NA> so it 'll be made of the same cotton cloth same balloon same internal pressure <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 566.98 571.29 <NA> but the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 571.29 578.64 <NA> and you 'll see that unlike the cross helical model this model resists extension and contraction and resists bending <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 578.51 579.97 <NA> now what that tells us is
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 579.96 586.84 <NA> <unk> that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues they 're an integral part of the penile skeleton
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 587.57 598.18 <NA> if the wall around the erectile tissue wasn 't there if it wasn 't reinforced in this way the shape would change but the inflated penis would not resist bending and erection simply wouldn 't work 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 597.69 599.9 <NA> it 's an observation with obvious medical
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 600.82 602.69 <NA> <unk> in humans as well 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 602.2 612.14 <NA> but it 's also relevant in a broad sense i think to the design of prosthetics <unk> soft robots basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 611.65 613.94 <NA> so to sum up 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 613.78 622.7 <NA> twenty years ago <unk> i had a college adviser tell me when i went to the college and said i 'm kind of interested in anatomy they said anatomy 's a dead science 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 622.48 629.97 <NA> he couldn 't have been more wrong <unk> i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 630.19 633.56 <NA> not just about its genetics and molecular biology <unk> 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 633.4 636.42 <NA> but up here in the meat end of the scale 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 636.42 649.59 <NA> we 've got limits on our time we often focus on one disease one model one problem <unk> but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 651.12 657.07 <NA> <unk> ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems 
DianeKelly_2012P 1 DianeKelly_2012P 657.06 663.89 <NA> there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found thank you
