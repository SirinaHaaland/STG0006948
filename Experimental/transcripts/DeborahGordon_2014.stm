DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 29.87 34.56 <NA> <unk> thinking that we could learn from this about other systems like brains

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 40.79 50.07 <NA> so what all these systems have in common is that there 's no central control an ant colony consists of sterile female workers
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 49.7 54.97 <NA> those are the ants you see walking around and then one or more reproductive females who just

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 59.94 65.71 <NA> they don 't tell anybody what to do <unk> so in an ant colony there 's no one in charge <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 65.52 72.55 <NA> and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 90.31 99.84 <NA> so here you see a lot of ants moving around and interacting in a lab arena that 's connected by tubes to two other arenas <unk> so when one
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 100.22 109.12 <NA> <unk> meets another it doesn 't matter which ant it meets and they 're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 119.21 124.47 <NA> so this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 124.25 129.91 <NA> and it 's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 158.58 162.56 <NA> is operating costs just what it takes to run the system

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 172.5 179.94 <NA> and the seed eating ants that i study in the desert have to spend water to get water so an ant outside foraging
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 179.9 189.06 <NA> <unk> searching for seeds in the hot sun just loses water into the air <unk> but the colony gets its water by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat <unk>

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 194.4 204.88 <NA> an outgoing forager doesn 't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers <unk> and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel into the nest and meeting outgoing foragers on their way
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 204.84 214.75 <NA> <unk> out this makes sense for the ant colony because the more food there is out there the more quickly the foragers find it the faster they come back <unk> and the more foragers they send out 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 214.95 223 <NA> the system works to stay stopped <unk> unless something positive happens so interactions function to activate foragers <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 223.17 229.43 <NA> and we 've been studying the evolution of this system first of all there 's variation it turns out that colonies are different
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 229.93 238.58 <NA> <unk> on dry days some colonies forage less so colonies are different in how they manage this trade off between spending water to search for seeds
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 238.41 241.76 <NA> and getting water back in the form of seeds 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 241.9 250.29 <NA> and we 're trying to understand why some colonies forage less than others by thinking about ants as neurons using models from neuroscience
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 250.55 260.14 <NA> <unk> so just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 260.14 272.1 <NA> and what we 're looking for is whether there might be small differences among colonies in how many interactions each ant needs before it 's willing to go out and forage <unk> because a colony like that would forage less <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 272.36 279.85 <NA> and this raises an analogous question about brains we talk about the brain but of course every brain is slightly different
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 279.83 289.96 <NA> and maybe there are some individuals or some conditions in which the electrical properties of neurons are such that they require more stimulus to fire <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 289.47 293.14 <NA> and that would lead to differences in brain function 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 293.64 299.2 <NA> so in order to ask evolutionary questions we need to know about reproductive success 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 298.89 304.91 <NA> this is a map of the study site where i have been tracking this population of harvester ant

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 309.14 321.21 <NA> each symbol is a colony <unk> and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies that is to figure out
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 320.97 329.88 <NA> which colonies were founded by a daughter queen produced by which parent colony <unk> and this was amazing for me after all these years to find out for example
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 329.9 333.94 <NA> <unk> colony one hundred and fifty four whom i 've known well for many years
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 335.15 342.75 <NA> here 's her daughter colony here 's her granddaughter colony <unk> and these are her great granddaughter colonies 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 342.26 347.77 <NA> and by doing this i was able to learn that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 347.61 349.96 <NA> in their decisions about which days are so
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 350.19 356.21 <NA> <unk> that they don 't forage <unk> and the offspring of parent colonies live so far from each other that the ants never meet 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 355.97 360.75 <NA> so the ants of the offspring colony can 't be learning this from the parent colony <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 360.76 366.01 <NA> and so our next step is to look for the genetic variation underlying this resemblance <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 367.11 371.38 <NA> so then i was able to ask okay <unk> who 's doing better <unk>

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 386.79 392.99 <NA> and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 392.99 400.08 <NA> so all this time i thought that colony one hundred and fifty four was a loser <unk> because on really dry days there 'd be just this trickle of foraging <unk> while
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 400.04 403.68 <NA> <unk> the other colonies were out foraging getting lots of food 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 403.19 411.09 <NA> but in fact colony one hundred and fifty four is a huge success <unk> she 's a matriarch <unk> she 's one of the rare great grandmothers on the site 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 410.72 418.57 <NA> to my knowledge this is the first time that we 've been able to track the ongoing evolution of collective behavior
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 418.4 423.93 <NA> in a natural population of animals and find out what 's actually working best <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 425.61 438.61 <NA> <unk> the internet uses an algorithm to regulate the flow of data that 's very similar to the one that the harvester ants are using to regulate the flow of foragers <unk> and guess what we call this analogy 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 439.44 442.42 <NA> the anternet is coming 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 443.31 451.48 <NA> so data doesn 't leave the source computer unless it gets a signal that there 's enough bandwidth for it to travel on 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 451.83 454.94 <NA> in the early days of the internet when operating costs were really

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 455.55 464.09 <NA> and it was really important not to lose any data then the system was set up for interactions to activate the flow of data 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 463.84 470.51 <NA> it 's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm that 's so similar to the one that we recently invented <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 470.14 479.97 <NA> but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms that we know about and ants have had one hundred and thirty million years to evolve a lot of good
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 479.93 490.08 <NA> <unk> ones and i think it 's very likely that some of the other twelve thousand species are going to have interesting algorithms for data networks that we haven 't even thought of yet <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 490.31 493.41 <NA> so what happens when operating costs are low 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 493.34 500.28 <NA> operating costs are low in the tropics because it 's very humid and it 's easy for the ants to be outside walking around 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 499.88 504.25 <NA> but the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 504.84 509.8 <NA> <unk> competition whatever resource one species is using another
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 509.63 513.22 <NA> species is likely to be using that at the same time <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 513.66 518.56 <NA> so in this environment interactions are used in the opposite way 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 518.37 529.91 <NA> the system keeps going unless something negative happens and one species that i study makes circuits in the trees of foraging ants going from the nest to a food source and back just round and round
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 529.89 532.91 <NA> unless something negative happens like an interaction

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 535.54 545.45 <NA> so here 's an example of ant security in the middle there 's an ant plugging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions <unk>
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 545.35 550.4 <NA> <unk> with another species those are the little ones running around with their abdomens up in the air <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 555.2 560.67 <NA> and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 573.02 577.06 <NA> so another environmental challenge that all systems have to deal with
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 576.9 579.94 <NA> is resources <unk> finding and collecting them
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 581.73 592.06 <NA> and to do this ants solve the problem of collective search <unk> and this is a problem that 's of great interest right now in robotics because we 've understood that rather than sending a single

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 600.67 603.41 <NA> <unk> it may be more effective to get

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 611.29 615.56 <NA> so the invasive argentine ant makes expandable search networks 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 615.13 621.77 <NA> they 're good at dealing with the main problem of collective search which is the trade off between

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 629.69 637.26 <NA> <unk> thoroughly because there will be another ant nearby searching over there but when there are a few ants in a large space 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 637.19 641.46 <NA> then they need to stretch out their paths to cover more ground 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 641.24 648.6 <NA> i think they use interactions to assess density so when they 're really crowded they meet more often <unk> and they search more thoroughly 
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 648.83 654.97 <NA> different ant species must use different algorithms because they 've evolved to deal with
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 655.13 659.62 <NA> different resources <unk> and it could be really useful to know about this <unk>

DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 675.24 679.94 <NA> so the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang
DeborahGordon_2014 1 DeborahGordon_2014 679.84 691.22 <NA> <unk> on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they 're less likely to interact <unk> and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up
