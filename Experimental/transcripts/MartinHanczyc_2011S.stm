MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 12.88 14.02 <NA> <unk> so historically
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 13.86 19.97 <NA> there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non living systems on one side <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 19.97 25.14 <NA> and living systems on the other side <unk> so we go from say this beautiful and complex crystal
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 26.45 30.87 <NA> <unk> this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 30.5 40.62 <NA> over the last hundred and fifty years or so science has kind of blurred this distinction between non living and living systems and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists <unk>
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 40.52 45.73 <NA> <unk> between the two we 'll just take one example here a virus is a natural system <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 51.03 58.6 <NA> <unk> have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a parasite on other living systems in order to say <unk> reproduce and evolve <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 58.6 68.05 <NA> but what we 're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non living end of this spectrum so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 67.71 74.99 <NA> <unk> mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 75.82 79.91 <NA> <unk> really what i 'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 79.72 90.14 <NA> so what are these characteristics that i 'm talking about these are them we consider first that life has a body now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 89.65 99.56 <NA> life also has a metabolism now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 99.4 104.88 <NA> life also has a kind of inheritable information now we as humans we store our information as
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 104.81 108.87 <NA> <unk> dna in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 108.62 118.44 <NA> if we couple the first two the body and the metabolism we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate and if we coupled these now to inheritable information we can come <unk>
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 118.34 124.21 <NA> <unk> up with a system that would be more lifelike and would perhaps evolve and so these are the things we will try to do in the lab 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 125.19 128.38 <NA> <unk> that have one or more of these characteristics of life 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 128.97 136.48 <NA> so how do we do this well we use a model system that we term a protocell you might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 136.2 149.72 <NA> it is a simple chemical model of a living cell and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together play together in a complex network to produce something that we call
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 150.94 160.61 <NA> <unk> in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules so a drastic reduction in complexity <unk> but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 161.5 170.42 <NA> and so what we do is we start simple and we work our way up to living systems consider for a moment this quote by leduc a hundred years ago <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 170.05 179.88 <NA> considering a kind of synthetic biology the synthesis of life should it ever occur will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea that 's his first statement so
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 179.96 184.05 <NA> <unk> actually create life in the laboratories it 's probably not going to impact our lives at all 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 183.8 195.57 <NA> if we accept the theory of evolution then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world or between the non living and living world <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 195.08 199.81 <NA> forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 200.88 214.33 <NA> <unk> to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment so we start simple we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life <unk> and then we try to develop that to become more more lifelike <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 213.9 223.04 <NA> this is how we can start to make a protocell <unk> we use this idea called self assembly what that means is i can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 223.04 224.9 <NA> and these these chemicals will start to
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 225.64 234.99 <NA> <unk> to form larger and larger structures <unk> so say on the order of tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn 't exist before <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 234.78 245.15 <NA> and in this particular example what i took is some membrane molecules mixed those together in the right environment and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here these <unk>
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 245.05 254.13 <NA> <unk> membranes are also quite similar morphologically and functionally to the membranes in your body and we can use these as they say to form the body of our protocell
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 254.69 264.3 <NA> <unk> likewise we can work with oil and water systems as you know when you put oil and water together they don 't mix but through self assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form and we can actually use this
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 264.3 271.36 <NA> as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell as you will see later <unk> so that 's just forming some
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 271.17 279.37 <NA> body stuff right some architectures what about the other aspects of living systems <unk> so we came up with this protocell model here that i 'm showing
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 279.87 290.17 <NA> <unk> started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite <unk> this is natural from the environment this clay <unk> it forms a surface that is say <unk> chemically active it could run a metabolism on it 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 289.98 295.37 <NA> certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay for example in this case rna shown in red
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 296.61 300.2 <NA> <unk> it 's an informational molecule it can come along and it starts to associate
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 300 301.67 <NA> with the surface of this clay <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 301.44 303.27 <NA> this structure then 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 303.09 312.25 <NA> can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself and that 's shown in green here on this micrograph 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 312.26 325.56 <NA> so just through self assembly mixing things together in the lab <unk> we can come up with say a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body <unk> right <unk> so we 're on a road towards
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 325.33 329.73 <NA> towards living systems <unk> but if you saw this protocell you would not confuse
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 329.78 338.43 <NA> <unk> something that was actually alive it 's actually quite lifeless <unk> once it forms it doesn 't really do anything so something is missing some things are missing 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 338.12 341.54 <NA> so some things that are missing is for example 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 341.54 350.4 <NA> if you had a flow of energy through a system <unk> what we 'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself <unk> much like living systems do <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 350.21 354.46 <NA> so we came up with a different protocell model and this is actually simpler than the previous one
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 355.26 365.53 <NA> <unk> in this protocell model it 's just an oil droplet but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something to actually become dynamic as we 'll see here <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 366.12 375.11 <NA> you add the droplet to the system it 's a pool of water and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system <unk> okay oil droplet forms through self assembly
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 375 385.1 <NA> <unk> has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment as we heard earlier <unk> movement is very important in these kinds of living systems <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 384.97 396.68 <NA> it is moving around exploring its environment and remodeling its environment as you see by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell so it 's acting in a sense like a living system trying to to preserve itself <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 397.18 404.97 <NA> we take this same moving protocell here <unk> and we put it in another experiment get it moving then i 'm going to add some food
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 404.96 407.73 <NA> <unk> to the system <unk> and you 'll see that in blue here <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 407.99 419.25 <NA> right <unk> so i add some food source to the system the protocell moves it encounters the food it reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 419.03 422.14 <NA> alright so not only do we have this system
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 421.9 425.02 <NA> that has a body it has a metabolism it can use energy
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 425.01 434.02 <NA> <unk> it moves around it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself now this doesn 't have a brain it doesn 't have
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 433.53 440.2 <NA> a neural system this is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 440.1 446.15 <NA> if we count the number of chemicals in that system actually including the water that 's in the dish we have five chemicals
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 445.91 454.97 <NA> that can do this so then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do and depending on the conditions <unk> we have some protocells on the
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 454.93 459.62 <NA> <unk> left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 459.62 466.94 <NA> on the other hand we have two moving protocells that like to circle each other and they form a kind of a dance a complex dance with each other right <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 466.48 471.87 <NA> so not only do individual protocells have behavior what we 've interpreted as behavior in this system <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 471.87 477.14 <NA> but we also have basically population level behavior similar to what organisms have 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 478.3 480 <NA> so now that you 're all experts
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 480.28 481.83 <NA> on protocells <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 481.52 486.06 <NA> we 're going to play a game with these protocells we 're going to make two different kinds 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 485.63 495.87 <NA> protocell a has a certain kind of chemistry inside that when activated the protocell starts to vibrate around just dancing so remember these are primitive things so dancing protocells that 's very interesting to us 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 496.55 503.92 <NA> the second protocell has a different chemistry inside and when activated the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 504.93 510.37 <NA> <unk> we just put these two together in the same system so there 's population a 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 511.08 515.68 <NA> there 's population b <unk> and then we activate the system <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 515.61 524.96 <NA> and protocell bs they 're the blue ones they all come together they fuse together to form one big blob <unk> and the other protocell just dances around and this just happens until
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 525.13 533.99 <NA> <unk> all of the energy in the system is basically used up and then game over <unk> so then i repeated this experiment a bunch of times and one time something very interesting happened <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 533.92 543.54 <NA> so i added these protocells together to the system <unk> and protocell a and protocell b fused together to form a hybrid protocell ab that didn 't happen before there it goes there
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 543.54 546.15 <NA> 's a protocell ab now in this system <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 545.91 549.84 <NA> protocell ab likes to dance around for a bit while
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 550.73 559.05 <NA> <unk> protocell b does the fusing <unk> okay <unk> but then something even more interesting happens watch when these two large protocells the hybrid ones fuse together 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 559.55 562.2 <NA> now we have a dancing protocell
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 563.75 565.14 <NA> <unk> event <unk> right 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 565.16 567.96 <NA> just with blobs of chemicals again so the
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 567.56 579.94 <NA> way this works is you have a simple system of five chemicals here a simple system here <unk> when they hybridize you then form something that 's different than before it 's more complex than before <unk> and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 579.87 582.22 <NA> <unk> which in this case is replication 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 583.26 589.63 <NA> so since we can make some interesting protocells that we like <unk> interesting colors and interesting behaviors 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 589.29 603.56 <NA> and they 're very easy to make and they have interesting lifelike properties perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth <unk> perhaps these represent an easily accessible step one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 605.07 607.79 <NA> there were molecules present on the early earth <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 607.63 615.42 <NA> but they wouldn 't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and and i showed in these experiments rather they 'd be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 615.42 622.71 <NA> because uncontrolled chemical reactions produce a diverse mixture of organic compounds think of it like a primordial ooze <unk> okay <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 622.5 629.64 <NA> and it 's a pool that 's too difficult to fully characterize even by modern methods and the product looks brown like this tar here on the left
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 629.9 632.88 <NA> <unk> pure compound is shown on the right <unk> for contrast 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 632.6 639.4 <NA> so this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen you put them in a pan and you apply energy you turn up the heat <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 639.4 645.16 <NA> you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar forming a brownish caramel <unk> right <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 644.95 649.93 <NA> if you let that go unregulated you 'll continue to make and break chemical bonds forming an even more diverse
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 650.28 656.18 <NA> <unk> mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan right that 's difficult to wash out <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 656.18 665.59 <NA> so that 's what the origin of life would have looked like you needed to get life out of this junk that is present on the early earth four four point five billion years ago <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 665.22 674.93 <NA> so the challenge then is throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this kind of primordial ooze <unk> so we 're able to then
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 675.91 687.65 <NA> <unk> of these oil droplet bodies again that we 've seen previously <unk> and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar this diverse very complex <unk> organic black tar and we put them into one of these
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 687.65 690.41 <NA> experiments as you 've seen earlier and then we watch
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 690.22 693.47 <NA> lively movement that comes out they look really good 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 693.46 700.43 <NA> very nice movement and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 699.97 704.18 <NA> similar to what we 've seen before but again <unk> working with just

MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 716.41 718.2 <NA> they really like that 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 718.19 727.45 <NA> they become very energetic and able to find the resource in the environment similar to what we saw before but again these are done in these primordial conditions really messy conditions not
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 727.26 729.22 <NA> sort of sterile laboratory conditions
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 730.01 737.86 <NA> these are very dirty little protocells as a matter of fact but they have lifelike properties is the point so

MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 740.46 747.86 <NA> helps us define a potential path between non living and living systems and not only that but it helps us

MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 754.96 758.66 <NA> <unk> that we find here on earth <unk> and that leads me to the next
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 758.26 763.52 <NA> term which is weird life this is a term by steve benner <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 763.06 771.24 <NA> this is used in reference to a report in two thousand and seven by the national research council in the united states wherein they tried to understand

MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 780.08 788.28 <NA> <unk> there how could we even recognize it as life well they came up with three very general criteria first is and they 're listed here the first is the system has to be <unk>
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 789.31 791.99 <NA> that means the system cannot be dead in a matter of fact 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 791.99 799.47 <NA> basically what that means is you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to to maintain itself <unk> 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 799.16 804.61 <NA> this is similar to having the sun shining on the earth <unk> driving photosynthesis driving the ecosystem

MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 807.99 818.08 <NA> secondly life needs to be in liquid form <unk> so that means even if we had some interesting structures interesting molecules together but they were frozen solid <unk> then this is not a good place for life 
MartinHanczyc_2011S 1 MartinHanczyc_2011S 817.83 825.02 <NA> and thirdly <unk> we need to be able to make and break chemical bonds and again this is important because life transforms resources
