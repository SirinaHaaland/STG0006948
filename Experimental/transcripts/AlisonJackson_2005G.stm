AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 25.37 36.48 <NA> <unk> all with the same concept <unk> and it 's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture <unk> and the importance of the image celebrity is born of photography <unk>
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 36.02 38.38 <NA> i 'm going to start with
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 37.9 44.07 <NA> how i started with this concept seven years ago <unk> when princess diana died 
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 44.27 50.23 <NA> there was a sort of a standstill in britain the moment of her death and people
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 50.05 51.78 <NA> decided to mourn
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 51.5 54.46 <NA> her death in a sort of mass way
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 55.67 69.37 <NA> fascinated by this phenomenon <unk> so i wondered could one erase the image of diana actually quite crudely and physically <unk> so i got a gun and started to shoot at the image of diana <unk> 
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 69.48 74.99 <NA> but i couldn 't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 75 84.17 <NA> public psyche momentum was being built the press wrote about her death in rather i felt pornographic
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 83.74 92.22 <NA> ways like which bit of artery left which bit of body and how did she die in the back of the car and i was intrigued by this sort of
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 92.22 99.93 <NA> mass voyeurism <unk> so i made these rather gory images <unk> i
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 100 101.13 <NA> went on
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 101.15 105.75 <NA> wondering whether i could actually replace her image <unk> 
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 105.74 112.35 <NA> so i got a look alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 111.98 113.88 <NA> and
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 113.81 128.13 <NA> created something that was in or existed in the public imagination so people were wondering was she going to marry dodi was she in love with him was she pregnant did she want his baby was she pregnant when she died
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 127.94 129.94 <NA> <unk> so i created this image of
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 129.9 134.81 <NA> <unk> diana dodi and their imaginary mixed race child and this image
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 134.81 140.99 <NA> came out which caused a huge public outcry at the time <unk> i then went on to make
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 140.8 148.63 <NA> more comments on the media and press imagery <unk> so i started making reference to media imagery
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 148.17 150.05 <NA> made it grainy <unk> shot
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 150 159.11 <NA> <unk> through doorways and so on and so forth to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism 
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 159.11 166.38 <NA> so this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband <unk> and this was a sequence
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 165.9 167.78 <NA> of images <unk> 
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 167.29 172.22 <NA> and this gets shown in art galleries like this as a sequence 
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 172.21 179.97 <NA> and similarly with the di dodian baby imagery this is another art gallery installation i 'm particularly interested in
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 180.17 185.58 <NA> how you can 't rely on your own perception this is jane smith
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 185.41 189.9 <NA> and jo bloggs for instance but you think it 's camilla and the queen 
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 189.5 200.05 <NA> and i 'm fascinated how what you think is real isn 't necessarily real <unk> and the camera can lie <unk> and it makes it very
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 201.66 205 <NA> <unk> the mass bombardment of imagery to
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 205.59 213.7 <NA> tell untruths <unk> so i continued to work on this project of how
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 213.7 216.4 <NA> photography seduces us
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 216.81 224.96 <NA> and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter <unk> and at the same time it removes us from the real
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 226.21 230.57 <NA> <unk> and this acts as a sort of titillating
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 230.32 237.11 <NA> thing so the photograph becomes this teaser and incites
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 236.65 249.29 <NA> desire and and voyeurism what you can 't have you want more in the photograph the real subject doesn 't exist so it makes you want that person more 
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 248.89 249.99 <NA> and that is
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 251.39 255.03 <NA> <unk> celebrity magazines work now <unk> the more

AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 287.16 294.7 <NA> <unk> all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist

AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 389.29 394.55 <NA> i was exploring at the time the hyperbole of icons and

AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 429.9 438.77 <NA> <unk> forth and only showing certain angles to create a reality that obviously is completely constructed <unk> this
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 438.56 443.22 <NA> is the look alike so the crafting elements of this is
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 443.06 448.6 <NA> completely enormous she looks nothing like marilyn but by the time we 've made her up
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 448.6 454.43 <NA> and put wigs and makeup on she looks exactly like marilyn to the extent
AlisonJackson_2005G 1 AlisonJackson_2005G 454.9 462.6 <NA> <unk> that her husband couldn 't recognize her or recognize this look alike in these photographs which i find quite interesting so
