ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 38.29 42.18 <NA> is more important to the world than at any point in human history 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 41.84 49.18 <NA> so at one end we 've got falling interest in education in math and at the other end we 've got a more mathematical world 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 49.18 51.99 <NA> a more quantitative world than we ever have had <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 52.55 54.73 <NA> so what 's the problem why has this
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 55.08 63.55 <NA> <unk> opened up and what can we do to fix it <unk> well actually i think the answer is staring us right in the face use computers 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 64.2 66.34 <NA> i believe that
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 66.33 69.04 <NA> correctly using computers
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 68.67 73.15 <NA> is the silver bullet for making math education work <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 73.05 79.97 <NA> so to explain that <unk> let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 80.31 83.24 <NA> see in the real world math
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 82.96 87.56 <NA> isn 't necessarily done by mathematicians <unk> it 's done by geologists <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 87.19 95.24 <NA> engineers <unk> biologists all sorts of different people modeling and simulation it 's actually very popular <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 94.93 99.99 <NA> but in education it looks very different dumbed down problems lots
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 100.97 109.23 <NA> <unk> mostly by hand <unk> lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world <unk> except if you 're learning it and
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 109.73 116.43 <NA> another thing about math <unk> math sometimes looks like math like in this example here
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 116.81 123.57 <NA> and sometimes it doesn 't like am i drunk 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 124.13 129.94 <NA> and then you get an answer that 's quantitative in the modern world <unk> you wouldn 't have expected that a few years back
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 130.01 136 <NA> <unk> but now you can find out all about unfortunately my weight is a little higher than that but
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 135.69 144.76 <NA> all about what happens <unk> so let 's zoom out a bit and ask why are we teaching people math what 's the point of teaching people math 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 145.08 153.1 <NA> and in particular why are we teaching them math in general why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 153.03 154.97 <NA> well i think there are about three
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 154.96 163.61 <NA> <unk> reasons technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies <unk> what i call everyday living
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 164.74 171.23 <NA> to function in the world today you 've got to be pretty quantitative much more so than a few years ago
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 171.07 176.75 <NA> <unk> figure out your mortgages being skeptical of government statistics those kinds of things
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 177.28 179.34 <NA> and thirdly what i would call
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 180.02 182.88 <NA> <unk> like logical mind training logical thinking 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 183.44 193.68 <NA> over the years we 've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically it 's part of human society it 's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 194.27 196.77 <NA> so let 's ask another question <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 196.94 204.64 <NA> what is math what do we mean when we say we 're doing math or educating people to do math well i think it 's about four steps roughly speaking
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 204.9 214.78 <NA> starting with posing the right question what is it that we want to ask what is it we 're trying to find out here and this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world beyond virtually any other part of doing <unk>
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 214.68 220.63 <NA> <unk> math people ask the wrong question and surprisingly enough they get the wrong answer for that reason if not for others 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 230.41 236.57 <NA> once you 've done that then there 's the computation step turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 236.68 239.54 <NA> and of course math is very powerful at doing that 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 239.11 246.41 <NA> and then finally <unk> turn it back to the real world <unk> did it answer the question and also verify it crucial step 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 246.79 249.53 <NA> now here 's the crazy thing right now 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 250.15 254.94 <NA> in math education we 're spending about perhaps eighty percent of the time teaching people to do
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 254.87 257.07 <NA> <unk> step three by hand <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 256.88 266.79 <NA> yet that 's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice instead we ought to be using computers to do step three
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 266.96 274.81 <NA> and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one two and four conceptualizing problems applying them
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 275.34 279.79 <NA> <unk> getting the teacher to run them through how to do that see crucial point here 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 279.75 282.41 <NA> math is not equal to calculating 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 282.17 285.41 <NA> math is a much broader subject than calculating 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 285.41 292.96 <NA> now it 's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years there was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 293.1 299.99 <NA> but in the last few decades that has totally changed we 've had the biggest transformation of any ancient
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 300 303.11 <NA> subject that i could ever imagine with computers 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 303.73 308.03 <NA> calculating was typically the limiting step and now often it isn 't 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 307.66 313.04 <NA> so i think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 312.79 320.18 <NA> but that math liberation didn 't get into education yet see i think of calculating in a sense as the machinery of math <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 320.14 325.55 <NA> it 's the chore <unk> it 's the thing you 'd like to avoid if you can like to get a machine to do 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 326.08 328.86 <NA> it 's a means to an end not an end in itself
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 331.4 337.06 <NA> and automation allows us to have that machinery computers allow us to do that
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 336.85 349.29 <NA> and this is not a small problem by any means i estimated that just today across the world we spent about one hundred and six average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 349.13 352.23 <NA> that 's an amazing amount of human endeavor 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 352.61 354.73 <NA> so we better be damn sure and by the way
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 354.96 356.8 <NA> <unk> 't even have fun doing it most of them
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 356.73 359.23 <NA> so we better be damn sure
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 359.01 363.4 <NA> that we know why we 're doing that and it has a real purpose
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 363.09 372.46 <NA> i think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that and i think there are some cases 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 372.39 374.96 <NA> for example mental arithmetic i still do a lot
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 380.11 386.13 <NA> <unk> think about it roughly it 's still quicker to do that and more practical so i think practicality is one case where it 's worth teaching people
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 385.95 387.5 <NA> by hand <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 387.34 393.83 <NA> and then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating but i think they 're relatively small in number 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 393.46 399.93 <NA> one thing i often ask about is ancient greek and how this relates see the thing we 're doing right
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 400 403.92 <NA> we 're forcing people to learn mathematics it 's a major subject 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 403.55 414.01 <NA> i 'm not for one minute suggesting that if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre they should do that that 's absolutely
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 413.68 417.09 <NA> the right thing for people to follow their self interest 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 417.44 426.28 <NA> i was somewhat interested in ancient greek but i don 't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient greek <unk> i don 't think it 's warranted <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 426.28 429.85 <NA> so i have this distinction between what we 're making people do and the
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 429.78 436.57 <NA> <unk> subject that 's sort of mainstream and the subject that in a sense people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 436.23 445.73 <NA> so what are the issues people bring up with this <unk> well one of them is they say you need to get the basics first you shouldn 't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 445.73 449.75 <NA> so my usual question is what do you mean by basics basics of
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 451.24 460.07 <NA> <unk> are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it <unk> or design it for that matter are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 460.93 465.62 <NA> i don 't think so i think you need to separate the basics of what you 're trying to do
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 465.37 469.58 <NA> from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 470.56 479.82 <NA> and automation allows you to make that separation a hundred years ago it 's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 479.72 482.43 <NA> <unk> ignition timing worked and all sorts of things 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 483.2 491.7 <NA> but automation in cars allowed that to separate so driving is now a quite separate subject so to speak from
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 491.42 494.04 <NA> engineering of the car
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 493.97 496.2 <NA> or learning how to service it <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 496.73 504.94 <NA> so automation allows this separation and also allows in the case of driving and i believe also in the future case of maths a democratized way of
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 505.01 509.77 <NA> of doing that it can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 509.85 516.94 <NA> so there 's another thing that comes up with basics people confuse in my view the order of the invention of the tools
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 516.57 525.17 <NA> with the order in which they should use them for teaching so just because paper was invented before computers it doesn 't necessarily mean you get more to the basics
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 527.71 530.9 <NA> <unk> using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics <unk>
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 531.46 538.34 <NA> my daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this <unk> she enjoys making what she calls paper laptops 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 539.71 548.64 <NA> so i asked her one day you know when i was your age i didn 't make these why do you think that was and after a second or two carefully reflecting she said
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 556.49 566.16 <NA> <unk> you were born after computers and paper it doesn 't really matter which order you 're taught with them in you just want to have the best tool <unk> so another one that comes up is computers dumb math down 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 566.21 573.51 <NA> that somehow if you use a computer <unk> it 's all mindless button pushing but if you do it by hand <unk> it 's all intellectual 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 573.62 575.02 <NA> this one kind of
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 577.89 579.44 <NA> <unk> do we really believe
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 579.2 583.06 <NA> that the math that most people are doing in school practically today
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 582.86 588.04 <NA> is more than applying procedures to problems they don 't really understand for reasons they don 't get 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 588.45 594.97 <NA> i don 't think so and what 's worse what they 're learning there isn 't even practically useful anymore might have been fifty years ago <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 594.54 598.84 <NA> but it isn 't anymore <unk> when they 're out of education they do it on a computer <unk>
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 598.68 604.58 <NA> just to be clear i think computers can really help with this problem actually make it more conceptual
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 604.99 611.24 <NA> <unk> of course like any great tool they can be used completely mindlessly like turning everything into a multimedia show 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 610.93 619.34 <NA> like the example i was shown of solving an equation by hand <unk> where the computer was the teacher show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 618.85 628.28 <NA> this is just nuts why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway all backwards <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 628.15 629.91 <NA> let me show you that
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 629.99 639.57 <NA> <unk> can also make problems harder to calculate <unk> see <unk> normally in school you do things like solve quadratic equations <unk> but
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 639.26 645.7 <NA> you see <unk> when you 're using a computer <unk> you can just substitute <unk> you can make it a quartic equation make it kind of harder
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 646.84 649.96 <NA> same principles applied calculations
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 651.21 660.52 <NA> <unk> and problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this they 've got hair all over them they 're not just simple dumbed down things that we see in school math 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 660.99 666.98 <NA> and think of the outside world do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 666.56 675.19 <NA> that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers i don 't think so quite the opposite <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 675.24 679.97 <NA> so the problem we 've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 679.72 683.9 <NA> <unk> down <unk> but that we have dumbed down problems right now
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 684.61 693.03 <NA> <unk> well another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding so if you go through lots of examples you can get
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 692.84 700.08 <NA> the answer you can understand how the basics of the system work better i think there is one thing that i think very valid here
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 700.01 709.14 <NA> <unk> which is that i think understanding procedures and processes is important but there 's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world it 's called programming 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 710.24 716.43 <NA> programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days and it 's also a great way
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 716.43 718.83 <NA> to engage students much more
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 718.49 724.56 <NA> and to check they really understand if you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 725.06 729.76 <NA> so programming is the way i think we should be doing that <unk> so to be clear what i really
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 729.9 737.53 <NA> <unk> am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual simultaneously <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 737.22 744.46 <NA> i can 't think of any other subject where that 's recently been possible it 's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 744.27 747.85 <NA> but i think we can do both at the same time here 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 747.93 749.32 <NA> and
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 749.97 754.91 <NA> we open up so many more possibilities <unk> you can do so many more problems what i
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 754.84 759.8 <NA> <unk> really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 759.63 768.47 <NA> far greater quantities than they 've ever got before and experience of harder problems being able to play with the math <unk> interact with it <unk> feel it 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 768.34 774.26 <NA> we want people who can feel the math instinctively that 's what computers allow us to do 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 773.89 779.88 <NA> another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum traditionally it 's been by how difficult it is to calculate
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 779.96 788.91 <NA> <unk> but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts however hard the calculating so calculus has traditionally been taught very late <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 788.57 793.41 <NA> why is this <unk> well it 's damn hard doing the calculations that 's the problem <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 794 798.9 <NA> but actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 799.16 804.31 <NA> this was an example i built for my daughter and very very simple
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 805.29 811.72 <NA> <unk> we were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number and
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 812.85 820.91 <NA> of course it turns into a circle and by the way she was also very insistent on being able to change the color an important feature
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 820.91 829.94 <NA> for this demonstration <unk> you can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 829.9 839.39 <NA> <unk> to an extreme and very small sides and a very large number of sides <unk> very simple example that 's a view of the world that we don 't usually give people for many many years after this 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 840.07 846.08 <NA> and yet that 's a really important practical view of the world <unk> so one of the roadblocks we have
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 845.62 849.08 <NA> in moving this agenda forward
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 849.04 854.97 <NA> is exams in the end if we test everyone by hand in exams <unk> it 's kind of hard to
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 855.41 861.48 <NA> to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the during the semesters
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 861.89 866.94 <NA> and one of the reasons it 's so important so it 's very important to get computers in exams <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 866.54 874.96 <NA> and then we can ask questions real questions questions like what 's the best life insurance policy to get real questions that people
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 875 876.64 <NA> <unk> have in their everyday lives and
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 876.75 887.02 <NA> you see this isn 't some dumbed down model here this is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens <unk> how many years of protection do i need what does that do to the payments
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 886.59 893.99 <NA> and to the interest rates and so forth now i 'm not for one minute suggesting it 's the only kind of question that that should be asked in exams <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 893.99 898.69 <NA> but i think it 's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 898.23 900.05 <NA> and is critical
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 907.36 909.05 <NA> <unk> got to make sure
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 908.92 912.56 <NA> that we can move our economies forward 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 912.1 917.9 <NA> and also our societies <unk> based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 919.18 925.02 <NA> this isn 't some optional extra and the country that does this first will
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 925.04 929.4 <NA> <unk> my view leapfrog others in achieving
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 929.81 933.87 <NA> a new economy even an improved economy an improved outlook in
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 933.62 939.54 <NA> fact i even talk about us moving from what we often call now the knowledge economy 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 939.08 947.49 <NA> to what we might call a computational knowledge economy where high level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 947.24 950.2 <NA> we can engage so many more students with this
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 950.76 957.04 <NA> <unk> and they can have a better time doing it <unk> and let 's understand this is not
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 956.7 963.41 <NA> an incremental sort of change we 're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real world math 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 963.41 970.21 <NA> and you know if you walk across a chasm you end up making it worse than if you didn 't start at all bigger disaster no
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 970.2 972.52 <NA> what i 'm suggesting
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 972.24 974.99 <NA> is that we should leap off we
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 975 980.86 <NA> we should increase our velocity so it 's high <unk> and we should leap off one side
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 980.64 985.19 <NA> and go the other of course having calculated our differential equation very carefully 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 986.32 996.8 <NA> so i want to see a completely renewed <unk> changed math curriculum built from the ground up based on computers being there computers that are now ubiquitous almost calculating <unk>
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 996.7 1000.85 <NA> <unk> machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 1005.41 1009.41 <NA> but what i am sure is it 's the mainstream subject of the future 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 1010.12 1012.74 <NA> let 's go for it <unk> 
ConradWolfram_2010G 1 ConradWolfram_2010G 1013.42 1020.01 <NA> and while we 're about it <unk> let 's have a bit of fun for us for the students and for ted here
