RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1026.29 1029.1 <NA> <unk> here 's an individual hair with a little split
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1029.9 1040.32 <NA> <unk> we measured the forces they were enormous <unk> they were so large that a patch of hairs about this size the gecko 's foot could support the weight of a small child about forty pounds easily <unk> 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1039.98 1042.33 <NA> now <unk> how do they do it 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1042.29 1049.9 <NA> we 've recently discovered this do they do it by friction no force is too low do they do it by electrostatics no
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1050 1059.62 <NA> <unk> you can change the charge they still hold on do they do it by interlocking that 's kind of a like a velcro like thing no <unk> you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces they don 't do it <unk> how about suction
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1059.19 1061.72 <NA> they stick on in a vacuum <unk> 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1061.8 1071.26 <NA> how about wet adhesion or capillary adhesion they don 't have any glue <unk> and they even stick under water just fine if you put their foot under water they grab on how do they do it then 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1071.1 1074.96 <NA> believe it or not they grab on by intermolecular
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1076.24 1090.32 <NA> <unk> by van der waals forces you know you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry where you had these two atoms they 're close together and the electrons are moving around that tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it 's added up so many times with these small structures
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1090.91 1092.81 <NA> what we 're doing
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1092.35 1095.54 <NA> is we 're taking that inspiration of the hairs 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1095.68 1104.43 <NA> and with another colleague at berkeley we 're manufacturing them and just recently we 've made a breakthrough where we now believe
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1104.87 1107.47 <NA> <unk> going to be able to create the first synthetic
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1108.55 1110.49 <NA> dry adhesive 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1111.98 1114.57 <NA> many companies are interested in this 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1116.81 1119.02 <NA> we also presented to nike even
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1129.81 1136.76 <NA> <unk> excited about this that we realized that that small size scale and where everything gets sticky and gravity doesn 't matter anymore
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1136.55 1141.55 <NA> we needed to look at ants and their feet because one of my other colleagues at berkeley
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1141.35 1148.21 <NA> has built a six millimeter silicone robot with legs <unk> but it gets stuck it doesn 't move very well <unk> 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1147.9 1152.23 <NA> but the ants do and we 'll figure out why so that ultimately we 'll make this move
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1151.98 1154.49 <NA> <unk> and imagine you 're going to be able to have swarms of
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1155.1 1156.21 <NA> these six millimeter robots
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1156.03 1158.12 <NA> available to run around
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1158.98 1162.23 <NA> where 's this going i think you can see it already clearly
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1162.01 1167.84 <NA> the internet is already having eyes and ears you have web cams and so forth
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1167.74 1175.05 <NA> <unk> but it 's going to also have legs and hands you 're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots so that you can
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1180.26 1183.12 <NA> <unk> we saw david kelly is at the beginning of that with his
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1182.69 1184.35 <NA> fish <unk> 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1184.31 1190.24 <NA> so in conclusion i think the message is clear if you need a message <unk> if nature 's not enough 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1190.24 1195.03 <NA> if you care about search and rescue or mine clearance or medicine or the various things we 're working on 
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1194.57 1196.95 <NA> we must preserve
RobertFull_2002 1 RobertFull_2002 1196.55 1201.19 <NA> nature 's designs otherwise these secrets will be lost forever thank you
