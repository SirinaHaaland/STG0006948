DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 17.17 23.09 <NA> <unk> basically had to roll down the window it was usually too hot too stuffy or just too smelly <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 23.08 29.94 <NA> and my father would not let us use the air conditioner he said that it would overheat the engine <unk> and you might remember some of
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 29.87 39.91 <NA> <unk> you how the cars were back then and it was a common problem of overheating <unk> but it was also the signal that capped the use or overuse of
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 41.23 42.57 <NA> devices 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 42.41 54.79 <NA> things have changed now we have cars that we take across country we blast the air conditioning the entire way <unk> and we never experience overheating <unk> so there 's no more signal for us to tell us to stop great right
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 55.02 59.08 <NA> well we have similar problems in buildings 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 58.89 62.34 <NA> in the past before air conditioning we had thick walls 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 62.34 74.75 <NA> the thick walls are great for insulation it keeps the interior very cool during the summertime <unk> and warm during the wintertime <unk> and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of of temperature transfer between the interior and
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 78.1 88.43 <NA> <unk> with the advent of plate glass rolled steel and mass production <unk> we were able to make floor to ceiling windows and unobstructed views <unk> and with that came the <unk>
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 88.38 96.65 <NA> irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar heated spaces <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 104.99 110.73 <NA> <unk> they require a huge amount of energy they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere and for some of you may
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 110.56 119.1 <NA> understand the heat island effect in cities where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 118.76 124.31 <NA> but we also have problems that when we lose power we can 't open a window here <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 124.31 129.97 <NA> and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 129.99 131.53 <NA> <unk> can start up again
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 131.88 139.42 <NA> <unk> even worse with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net zero energy state
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 139.05 149.41 <NA> we can 't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient we need to look for something else and we 've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut so what do we do here how do <unk>
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 149.31 153.82 <NA> <unk> we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we 've dug <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 154.96 160.13 <NA> <unk> at biology and many of you probably don 't know i was a biology major before i went into architecture 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 160.18 166.97 <NA> the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 166.54 170.91 <NA> and it 's a fantastic thing that 's the first line of defense for the body <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 170.91 180 <NA> it has pores it has sweat glands it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently and so what i propose is that our building skins
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 180.28 182.4 <NA> should be more similar to
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 181.94 184.2 <NA> to human skin <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 183.77 190.93 <NA> and by doing so can be much more dynamic responsive and and differentiated depending on where it is <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 190.93 200.02 <NA> and this gets me back to my research what i proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that i presently or currently
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 200.01 201.88 <NA> <unk> work with smart materials and a smart <unk>
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 203.04 211.48 <NA> first of all i guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy <unk> and that 's a very big deal for architecture what it
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 211.14 225.05 <NA> is it 's a lamination of two different metals together you can see that here by the different reflection on this side <unk> and because it has two different coefficients of expansion when heated <unk> one side will expand faster than the other and
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 225.04 227 <NA> <unk> result in a curling action 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 228.46 238.55 <NA> so in early prototypes i built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 238.87 246.96 <NA> and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 246.79 250.2 <NA> when also heated <unk> and currently
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 250.13 259.95 <NA> <unk> have this installation at the materials & applications gallery in silver lake close by and it 's there until august if you want to see it it 's called bloom and the surface is made completely out of <unk>
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 261.2 265.41 <NA> and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things one <unk>
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 266.86 279.31 <NA> device so that when the sun hits the surface it constricts the amount of sun passing through and in other areas <unk> it 's a ventilating system so that hot trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 280.5 289.9 <NA> you can see here in this time lapse video that the sun as it moves across the surface as well as the shade each of the tiles moves individually <unk>
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 289.85 300.35 <NA> <unk> keep in mind with the digital technology that we have today this thing was made out of about fourteen thousand pieces and there 's no two pieces alike at all <unk> every single one is different 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 304.75 313.49 <NA> <unk> very specific to its location to the angle of the sun and also how the thing actually curls so this kind of
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 313.18 317.42 <NA> proof of concept project has a lot of implications
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 317.05 325.2 <NA> to actual future application in architecture <unk> and in this case here you see a house that 's for a developer in china
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 325.22 333.48 <NA> <unk> and it 's actually a four story glass box it 's still with that glass box because we still want that that visual access <unk> but now it 's sheathed with this <unk>
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 334.75 342.06 <NA> layer it 's a screen that goes around it and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 341.83 343.84 <NA> in addition to that 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 343.84 354.82 <NA> it can also screen areas for privacy so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day <unk> and what it basically implies is that in houses now
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 354.95 364.75 <NA> need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 365.64 372.11 <NA> i 'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market and so here you see a pretty typical
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 372.11 379.16 <NA> <unk> double glazed window panel <unk> and in that panel between those two pieces of glass that
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 380.19 388.13 <NA> i 'm trying to work on making a thermo bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 387.73 400.14 <NA> heats that interior cavity that thermo bimetal will begin to curl <unk> and what actually will happen then is it 'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building <unk> and totally if necessary
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 400.52 410.7 <NA> <unk> and so you can imagine even in this application that in a high rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to thirty forty floors the entire surface could <unk>
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 410.6 416.73 <NA> <unk> be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 425.49 432.13 <NA> <unk> it 's actually smaller pieces of thermometal and it 's actually going to we 're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 433.62 436.93 <NA> this last project is also of components 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 436.68 447.62 <NA> the influence and if you have noticed one of my spheres of influence is biology is from a grasshopper and grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system they breathe through
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 447.46 454.97 <NA> holes in their sides called spiracles and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down and so in this project
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 455.07 461.27 <NA> trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 460.9 466.44 <NA> and so you see here some early studies of blocks where those holes are actually
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 465.96 470.39 <NA> coming through and this is before the thermo bimetal is applied <unk> 
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 470.17 477.81 <NA> and this is after the bimetal is applied <unk> sorry it 's a little hard to see but on the surfaces you can see these red arrows on the left
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 477.65 479.07 <NA> it 's when it 's cold and the
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 479.87 487.86 <NA> <unk> is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks <unk> and on the right the thermo bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through so
DorisKimSung_2012X 1 DorisKimSung_2012X 487.86 497.41 <NA> those are two different components that i 'm working on and again <unk> it 's a completely different thing because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows
