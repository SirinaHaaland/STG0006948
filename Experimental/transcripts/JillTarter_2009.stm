JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1091.95 1095.9 <NA> in the ultimate search for cosmic company 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1095.62 1104.97 <NA> the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust to build an environment where raw data could be stored <unk> and where
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1105.28 1112.51 <NA> it could be accessed and manipulated where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1112.51 1118.71 <NA> and this is a technically creative challenge and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1118.64 1123.06 <NA> and then we 'd like to augment
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1122.57 1125.22 <NA> the automated search
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1127.62 1135.22 <NA> <unk> we 'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find

JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1139.71 1145.33 <NA> and of course <unk> we 'd like to inspire and engage the next generation <unk> 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1145.26 1147.14 <NA> we 'd like
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1146.9 1154.7 <NA> to take the materials that we have built for education and get them out to students everywhere
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1154.9 1163.97 <NA> <unk> students that can 't come and visit us at the ata we 'd like to tell our story better and engage young people and thereby change their perspective <unk> 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1163.66 1169.22 <NA> i 'm sorry seth godin <unk> but over the millennia <unk> we 've seen where tribalism leads <unk> 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1168.91 1175.16 <NA> we 've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands

JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1180.65 1190.23 <NA> to earthlings and seti is a mirror a mirror that can show us ourselves from an extraordinary perspective 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1190.01 1199.81 <NA> and can help to trivialize the differences among us <unk> if seti does nothing but change the perspective
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1199.65 1204.97 <NA> of humans on this planet then it will be one of the most profound endeavors
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1205.04 1206.32 <NA> in history 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1206.61 1210.7 <NA> so in the opening days of two thousand and nine 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1210.66 1215.89 <NA> a visionary president stood on the steps of the u s capitol and said 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1215.85 1224.77 <NA> we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve 
JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1224.37 1228.71 <NA> that as the world grows smaller our common humanity

JillTarter_2009 1 JillTarter_2009 1229.98 1238.17 <NA> so i look forward to working with the ted community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish <unk> and
