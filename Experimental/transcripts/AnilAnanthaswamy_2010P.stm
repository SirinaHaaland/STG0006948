AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 1 AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 196.22 204.97 <NA> and the reason why they have to go underground is that if you did this experiment on the surface of the earth <unk> the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by

AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 1 AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 226.53 233.25 <NA> you can barely see it and the reason for that is it 's entirely dark in there this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners
AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 1 AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 233.07 239.45 <NA> who left this mine in one thousand nine hundred and sixty and physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s

AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 1 AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 260.71 268.15 <NA> then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about one of them being neutrinos 
AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 1 AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P 267.92 276.79 <NA> and neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules when a neutrino hits a water molecule
