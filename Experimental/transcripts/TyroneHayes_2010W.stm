TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 22.7 29.1 <NA> that i discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 28.86 29.97 <NA> mimics estrogen
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 30.37 36.42 <NA> when it gets into the human body now it 's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 36.25 42.99 <NA> into the human body through the skin and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 42.59 54.97 <NA> that was the start of my journey to make this film toxic baby and it doesn 't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue one is that you and i all have
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 55.31 59.29 <NA> between thirty to fifty thousand chemicals in our bodies
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 59.09 61.66 <NA> that our grandparents didn 't have 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 61.44 71.71 <NA> and many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we 're seeing across industrialized nations i
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 71.71 73.84 <NA> 'll show you some statistics <unk> 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 73.8 75.05 <NA> so for example
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 75.04 83.31 <NA> <unk> in the united kingdom the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by twenty percent just in a generation very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the u s 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 83.31 87.27 <NA> in canada we 're now looking at one in ten canadian children
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 86.91 92.9 <NA> with asthma that 's a four fold increase <unk> again similar story around the world 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 92.92 104.97 <NA> in the united states probably the most astonishing statistic is a six hundred percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities <unk> again we 're seeing that
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 104.99 109.84 <NA> <unk> trend across europe across north america and in europe 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 109.6 116.66 <NA> there 's certain parts of europe where we 're seeing a <unk> four fold increase in certain genital birth defects 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 116.66 124.02 <NA> interestingly one of those birth defects has seen a two hundred percent increase in the u s so a real skyrocketing

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 137.58 146.92 <NA> that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs tyrone hayes
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 148.32 154.58 <NA> it was a surprise to me as well that i would be talking about pesticides

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 180.38 195.57 <NA> turns out atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world it 's the number one contaminant of groundwater drinking water rain water <unk> in two thousand and three after my studies it was banned in the european union but in that same year the united states <unk>
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 196.72 204.97 <NA> the compound <unk> we were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine zero point one

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 247.18 254.97 <NA> in recent studies that we 've published we 've shown that some of these animals when they 're exposed to atrazine some of the males grow up and completely become females
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 255.13 263.98 <NA> <unk> so these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship and not only do these genetic males mate with other males they actually have the capacity to lay eggs

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 266.63 278.43 <NA> what we proposed and what we 've now generated support for is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance <unk> normally the testes should make testosterone the male hormone <unk> 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 278 279.82 <NA> but what atrazine does is it
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 279.78 285.46 <NA> <unk> turns on an enzyme the machinery if you will aromatase <unk> that converts testosterone into estrogen 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 285.46 294.58 <NA> and as a result these exposed males lose their testosterone they 're chemically castrated and they 're subsequently feminized because now they 're making the female hormone 
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 294.15 299.84 <NA> now this is what brought me to the human related issues because it turns out that the number one
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 301.69 312.26 <NA> <unk> breast cancer is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase <unk> so when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast aromatase converts androgens into estrogens and that estrogen <unk>

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 331.7 344.92 <NA> now what 's interesting is of course that we 're still using eighty million pounds of atrazine the number one contaminant in drinking water that does the opposite turns on aromatase <unk> increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 347.54 354.85 <NA> what 's interesting is in fact the same company that sold us eighty million pounds of atrazine the breast cancer promoter now sells us the
TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 354.78 359.12 <NA> <unk> blocker the exact same company <unk> and so i find it interesting that instead of

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 368.4 375.05 <NA> so speaking of estrogen one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 396.78 402.84 <NA> and there have been many many many studies that have shown that bpa leaches from babies ' bottles

TyroneHayes_2010W 1 TyroneHayes_2010W 538.6 549.99 <NA> because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones of those rats that don 't abort atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man 's disease of those that don
