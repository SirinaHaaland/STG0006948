JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 27.95 35.82 <NA> <unk> let 's define listening as making meaning from sound it 's a mental process and it 's a process of extraction 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 35.33 41.77 <NA> we use some pretty cool techniques to do this one of them is pattern recognition so in a cocktail party like this 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 41.53 46.12 <NA> if i say david <unk> sara pay attention some of you just sat up
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 46.12 52.11 <NA> <unk> we recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal <unk> and especially our name <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 51.71 54.97 <NA> differencing is another technique we use if i left this
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 54.99 64.18 <NA> <unk> pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes you would literally cease to hear it we listen to differences we discount sounds that remain the same <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 64.53 75.07 <NA> and then there is a whole range of filters these filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to most people are entirely unconscious <unk>
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 75.02 80 <NA> of these filters <unk> but they actually create our reality in a way because they tell us what
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 79.99 86.96 <NA> <unk> we 're paying attention to right now i 'll give you one example of that intention is very important in sound in listening 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 86.96 93.44 <NA> when i married my wife i promised her i would listen to her every day as if for the first time 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 93.4 97.67 <NA> now that 's something i fall short of on a daily basis 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 97.66 99.99 <NA> but it 's a great intention to have in a
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 102.53 106.53 <NA> <unk> but that 's not all sound places us in space and in time 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 106.52 120.51 <NA> if you close your eyes right now in this room you 're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces you 're aware of how many people are around you because of the micro noises you 're receiving <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 120.02 129.76 <NA> and sound places us in time as well because sound always has time embedded in it in fact i would suggest that our listening is the main way that we
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 129.72 133.42 <NA> <unk> experience the flow of time from past to future 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 133.26 140.41 <NA> so sonority is time and meaning a great quote i said at the beginning we 're losing our listening why did i say that 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 140.21 142.24 <NA> well there are a lot of reasons for this 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 142.24 153.13 <NA> first of all we invented ways of recording first writing then audio recording and now video recording as well the premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 152.85 154.97 <NA> secondly the world is now
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 154.93 162.1 <NA> <unk> so noisy with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily <unk> it 's just hard
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 161.94 164.75 <NA> to listen it 's tiring to listen <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 164.56 167.37 <NA> many people take refuge in headphones <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 167.37 174.99 <NA> but they turn big public spaces like this shared soundscapes <unk> into millions of tiny little personal
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 176.66 179.4 <NA> <unk> this scenario nobody 's listening to anybody <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 179.33 188.44 <NA> we 're becoming impatient we don 't want oratory anymore we want sound bites and the art of conversation is being replaced
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 188.11 198 <NA> dangerously i think by personal broadcasting i don 't know how much listening there is in this conversation which is sadly very common especially in the uk <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 197.9 204.91 <NA> we 're becoming desensitized our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 205.08 211.06 <NA> and that means it 's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet the subtle the understated 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 211.74 217 <NA> this is a serious problem that we 're losing our listening this is not trivial 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 216.66 227.03 <NA> because listening is our access to understanding conscious listening always creates understanding and only without conscious listening
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 226.8 229.85 <NA> can these things happen a world where we
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 230.07 235.01 <NA> 't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 235.21 244.34 <NA> so i 'd like to share with you five simple exercises tools you can take away with you to improve your own conscious listening would you like that audience yes 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 244.6 248.06 <NA> good the first one is silence 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 247.75 254.97 <NA> just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 254.93 261.09 <NA> <unk> you can hear the quiet again if you can 't get absolute silence go for quiet that 's absolutely fine 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 261.05 268.89 <NA> second i call this the mixer so even if you 're in a noisy environment like this and we all spend a lot of
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 269.99 279.61 <NA> listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can i hear how many individual channels in that mix am i listening to you can do it in a beautiful place as well like
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 279.9 288.1 <NA> <unk> lake how many birds am i hearing where are they where are those ripples <unk> it 's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 288.54 296.53 <NA> third <unk> this exercise i call savoring and this is a beautiful exercise it 's about enjoying mundane sounds this for example 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 296.64 300.31 <NA> is my tumble dryer it 's a waltz
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 299.95 300.95 <NA> one

JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 317.5 324.68 <NA> so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention i call that the hidden choir it 's around us all the time 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 324.58 329.91 <NA> the next exercise is probably the most important of all of these if you just take one thing
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 329.84 335.4 <NA> <unk> away this is listening positions the idea that you can move your listening position
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 335.27 338.38 <NA> to what 's appropriate to what you 're listening to 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 338.2 352.38 <NA> this is playing with those filters remember i gave you those filters it 's starting to play with them as levers to get conscious about them and to move to different places these are just some of the listening positions or scales of listening positions that you can use there are many 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 352.38 354.55 <NA> have fun with that it 's very exciting
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 356.23 366.41 <NA> an acronym you can use this in listening in communication if you 're in any one of those roles and i think that probably is everybody who 's listening to this talk
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 366.2 374.9 <NA> the acronym is rasa which is the sanskrit word for juice or essence and rasa stands for receive 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 381.88 386.72 <NA> <unk> is very important in communication and ask ask questions afterwards 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 386.53 394.34 <NA> now sound is my passion it 's my life i wrote a whole book about it so i live to listen that 's too much to ask for most people 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 394.18 398.67 <NA> but i believe that every human being needs to listen consciously
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 398.48 400.8 <NA> in order to live fully
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 400.58 404.97 <NA> connected in space and in time to the physical world around us connected
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 404.93 412.61 <NA> <unk> in understanding to each other not to mention spiritually connected because every spiritual path i know of has listening and contemplation
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 412.45 414.15 <NA> at its heart 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 414.08 420.24 <NA> that 's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 419.93 425.08 <NA> why is it not taught it 's crazy <unk> and if we can teach listening in our schools
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 425.28 436.04 <NA> <unk> we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous scary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time or at least capable of doing it <unk> 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 436.04 438.14 <NA> now i don 't know how to do that 
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 437.92 439.45 <NA> but this is ted
JulianTreasure_2011G 1 JulianTreasure_2011G 439.53 449.2 <NA> <unk> and i think the ted community is capable of anything <unk> so i invite you to connect with me connect with each other take this mission out and let 's get listening taught in schools <unk>
