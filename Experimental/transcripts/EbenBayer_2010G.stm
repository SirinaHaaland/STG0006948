EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 12.67 18.32 <NA> <unk> like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 18.31 25.91 <NA> but before i do that i need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics which require huge amounts of energy to create
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 25.51 29.58 <NA> and because of their disposal issues are slowly poisoning our planet
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 29.99 32.56 <NA> i also want to tell you and share with you
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 32.35 36.3 <NA> how my team and i have been using mushrooms over the last three years
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 36.62 38.43 <NA> <unk> not like that 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 38.6 48.6 <NA> we 're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials <unk> which perform a lot like plastics during their use but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 48.17 49.69 <NA> at the end of their lives
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 52.5 59.56 <NA> <unk> but first i need to talk to you about what i consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 59.1 64.81 <NA> this is a material you all know is styrofoam <unk> but i like to think of it as toxic white stuff 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 64.53 69.86 <NA> in a single cubic foot of this material about what would come around your computer or large television
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 69.66 75.08 <NA> you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol yet after just a few weeks of use
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 75.43 77.51 <NA> <unk> throw this material in the trash <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 77.59 80 <NA> and this isn 't just found in packaging 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 79.75 89.3 <NA> twenty billion dollars of this material is produced every year in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops <unk> and that 's not the only place it 's found 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 89.35 96.08 <NA> the epa estimates in the united states by volume this material occupies twenty five percent of our landfills <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 95.89 99.9 <NA> even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment on the side of the
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 100 109.66 <NA> <unk> road or next to a river <unk> if it 's not picked up by a human like me and you it 'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years <unk> perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 109.66 119.1 <NA> like in the great plastic gyre <unk> where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits but they 're not really going away <unk> they 're not biologically compatible 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 118.64 125.37 <NA> they 're basically fouling up earth 's respiratory and circulatory systems <unk> and because these materials are so prolific 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 125.21 129.61 <NA> because they 're found in so many places there 's one other place you 'll find this material
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 130.22 134.24 <NA> <unk> which is made from benzene a known carcinogen you 'll find it
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 134.06 135.58 <NA> inside of you 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 136.17 143.53 <NA> so for all these reasons i think we need better materials and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 143.76 146.08 <NA> the first is feedstocks <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 146.01 154.97 <NA> today we use a single feedstock petroleum to heat our homes <unk> power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you we recognize this is a finite
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 154.93 160.95 <NA> <unk> resource <unk> and it 's simply crazy to do this to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 160.71 170.16 <NA> second of all <unk> we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials i say far less because ten percent isn 't going to cut it <unk> we should be talking about half a quarter
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 170.16 172.46 <NA> one tenth the energy content 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 172.69 175.02 <NA> and lastly and i think perhaps
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 176.6 180.9 <NA> <unk> we should be creating materials that fit into what i call nature 's recycling system 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 180.41 189.69 <NA> this recycling system has been in place for the last billion years <unk> i fit into it you fit into it and a hundred years tops my body can return to the earth with no preprocessing <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 189.35 194.61 <NA> yet that packaging i got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years <unk> this is crazy <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 194.45 197.37 <NA> but nature provides us with a really good model here 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 198.26 204.55 <NA> when a tree 's done using its leaves its solar collectors these amazing molecular photon capturing devices at the end of a season
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 204.93 214.21 <NA> <unk> doesn 't pack them up take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves it just drops them the shortest distance possible to the forest floor 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 213.96 218.38 <NA> where they 're actually upcycled into next year 's topsoil <unk> and this
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 218.76 225.05 <NA> gets us back to the mushrooms because in nature mushrooms are the recycling system <unk> and what we
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 226.15 229.61 <NA> <unk> by using a part of the mushroom you 've probably never seen
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 229.18 232.58 <NA> analogous to its root structure it 's called mycelium
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 232.12 236.9 <NA> we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 237.1 246.39 <NA> now mycelium is an amazing material <unk> because it 's a self assembling material it actually takes things we would consider waste things like seed husks or woody biomass
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 246.18 249.93 <NA> and can transform them into a chitinous polymer which you can form into almost any
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 250.25 252.81 <NA> <unk> in our process <unk> we basically use it
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 252.32 253.89 <NA> as a glue <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 253.91 259.08 <NA> and by using mycelium as a glue you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 258.71 263.85 <NA> and you can create materials with many different properties materials that are insulating
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 267.73 275.05 <NA> materials that can absorb impacts that can absorb acoustical impacts <unk> but these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts not
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 276.84 282.58 <NA> <unk> and because they 're made of natural materials they are one hundred percent compostable in you own backyard <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 283.65 288.34 <NA> so i 'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 287.88 294.13 <NA> the first is selecting a feedstock <unk> preferably something that 's regional that 's in your area right local manufacturing <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 294.09 300.97 <NA> the next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool physically filling an enclosure a mold in whatever shape you want to get 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 301.05 302.39 <NA> then
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 302.22 304.97 <NA> you actually grow the mycelium through these particles
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 304.96 314.41 <NA> <unk> and that 's where the magic happens because the organism is doing the work in this process not the equipment the final step is of course the product whether it 's a packaging material a table top or
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 314.25 315.65 <NA> building block 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 315.25 324.95 <NA> our vision is local manufacturing like the local food movement for production so we 've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts <unk> if you 're in china 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 324.52 326.72 <NA> you might use a rice husk
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 326.35 329.97 <NA> or a cottonseed hull if you 're in northern europe or north america
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 330.08 333.33 <NA> <unk> you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 334.01 342.09 <NA> we then process these husks with some basic equipment and i want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 342.23 349.21 <NA> <unk> so what you 're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from texas in this case it 's a waste product <unk> and what they 're doing in our equipment
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 348.97 350.65 <NA> is going through a continuous system
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 355.2 363.17 <NA> <unk> these materials <unk> while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium this gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape though
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 362.99 372.37 <NA> today we 're making corner blocks and it 's when this lid goes on the part that the magic really starts because the manufacturing process is our organism it
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 372.81 379.25 <NA> 'll actually begin to digest these wastes and over the next five days <unk> assemble them into biocomposites
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 379.99 381.32 <NA> <unk> entire facility
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 381.31 390.72 <NA> is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark <unk> quietly <unk> self assembling materials and everything from building materials
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 390.27 396.98 <NA> to in this case a packaging corner block <unk> so i 've said a number of times that we grow materials and
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 396.98 404.46 <NA> it 's kind of hard to picture how that happens <unk> so my team has taken five days worth of growth a typical growth cycle for us and condensed it into
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 404.95 410.4 <NA> 15 second time lapse <unk> and i want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 409.97 419.46 <NA> because over the five day period what they do is extend out and through this material using the energy that 's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 419.46 424.81 <NA> this matrix <unk> self assembles growing through and around the particles making millions and millions of tiny
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 425.79 431.77 <NA> <unk> and what parts of the seed husk we don 't digest actually become part of the final physical composite <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 431.77 439.9 <NA> so in front of your eyes this part just <unk> self assembled it actually takes a little longer it takes five days <unk> but it 's much faster than conventional farming 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 439.98 444.32 <NA> the last step of course is application in this case we 've grown a corner block 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 444.08 452.32 <NA> a major fortune five hundred furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment they used to use a plastic packaging buffer <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 452.31 454.97 <NA> but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 455.1 456.83 <NA> with our grown material <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 456.55 458.39 <NA> best of all 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 458.02 466.52 <NA> when it gets to the customer it 's not trash they can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing <unk> and it 's going to improve the local soil 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 466.51 474.84 <NA> so why mycelium the first reason is local open feedstocks you want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls <unk> because you have
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 477.56 487.71 <NA> <unk> because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process you don 't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility so you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 487.52 496.63 <NA> biological yield is really important <unk> and because one hundred percent of what we put in the tool become the final product <unk> even the parts that aren 't digested become part of the structure we
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 496.63 498.87 <NA> 're getting incredible yield rates 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 498.5 500.02 <NA> natural polymers
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 500.79 502.57 <NA> <unk> i think that 's what 's most important <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 502.2 512.18 <NA> because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years <unk> in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans they 're not going to clog up earth 's ecosystems they work great <unk> 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 512.18 518.41 <NA> and while today we can practically guarantee that yesterday 's packaging is going to be here in ten thousand years 
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 518.37 520.39 <NA> what i want to guarantee
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 519.96 527.2 <NA> is that in ten thousand years <unk> our descendants our children 's children will be living happily and in harmony
EbenBayer_2010G 1 EbenBayer_2010G 526.74 532.67 <NA> with a healthy earth <unk> and i think that can be some really good news <unk> thank you
