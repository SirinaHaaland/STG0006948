SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 60.3 68.77 <NA> as for measles so much in the news recently the death toll is actually tenfold higher 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 69.12 76.63 <NA> yet for the last year <unk> it has been ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 76.47 79.76 <NA> clearly there is something deeply rooted about it
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 79.75 86.84 <NA> <unk> something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases <unk> but what is it exactly <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 86.86 93.56 <NA> well it 's hard to acquire ebola <unk> but if you do the risk of a horrible death is high <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 93.25 102.77 <NA> why because right now <unk> we don 't have any effective therapy or vaccine available and so that 's the clue <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 102.52 104.49 <NA> we may have it someday
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 105.41 106.49 <NA> <unk> so
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 106.27 116.61 <NA> we rightfully fear ebola because it it doesn 't kill as many people as other diseases in fact it 's much less transmissible than viruses <unk>
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 116.51 128.38 <NA> <unk> such as flu or measles we fear ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can 't treat it we fear the certain inevitability that comes with ebola
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 130.05 138.4 <NA> <unk> inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science <unk> but wait a second why is that we 've known about ebola since one thousand nine <unk>
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 139.7 147.31 <NA> we 've known what it 's capable of we 've had ample opportunity to study it in the twenty four outbreaks that have occurred <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 147.31 153.67 <NA> and in fact we 've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 153.42 154.97 <NA> why is that those
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 154.99 158.57 <NA> <unk> vaccines are just going into clinical trials now 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 158.44 167.6 <NA> this goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases <unk> it goes something like this 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 167.5 175.4 <NA> the people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 175.36 179.64 <NA> this leaves little in the way of market incentives for
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 179.6 187.35 <NA> <unk> manufacturers to develop vaccines <unk> unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 187.35 190.35 <NA> it 's simply too commercially risky 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 190.79 195.42 <NA> as for ebola there is absolutely no market at all 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 194.93 204.15 <NA> so the only reason we have two vaccines in late stage clinical trials now is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 205.37 210.13 <NA> was relatively ignored until september eleven
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 209.96 217.31 <NA> and the anthrax attacks when all of a sudden people perceived ebola as potentially a bioterrorism weapon 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 217.31 222.04 <NA> why is it that the ebola vaccine wasn 't fully developed at this point <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 221.64 224.87 <NA> well partially because it was really difficult or
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 225 232.81 <NA> <unk> to be difficult to weaponize the virus but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 232.81 235.22 <NA> and this is really the point 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 235.24 241.98 <NA> the sad reality is we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 241.98 246.65 <NA> but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 246.37 254.97 <NA> vaccine development is expensive and complicated it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well known antigen and turn it into a
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 254.93 256.5 <NA> <unk> viable vaccine 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 256.46 263.34 <NA> fortunately for diseases like ebola <unk> there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 262.88 267.3 <NA> the first is to recognize when there 's a complete market failure 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 266.87 275.14 <NA> in that case if we want vaccines <unk> we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 276.18 286.4 <NA> <unk> we also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us by creating capabilities within countries <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 286.4 297.64 <NA> we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 297.63 299.81 <NA> the data from that then can be
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 300 308.64 <NA> <unk> used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 309.9 312.62 <NA> and what type of reactions they promote <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 312.7 324.49 <NA> so these are the things that can be done but to do this if we want to deal with a complete market failure <unk> we have to change the way we we view and prevent infectious diseases <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 328.01 334.17 <NA> <unk> we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 334.13 342.22 <NA> so for ebola the paranoid fear of an infectious disease followed by
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 342.04 350.02 <NA> a few cases transported to wealthy countries <unk> led the global community to come together <unk> and with the work of dedicated
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 351.66 353.95 <NA> <unk> we now have these

SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 370.26 374.93 <NA> every year <unk> we spend billions of dollars keeping a fleet

SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 383.02 386.49 <NA> and yet <unk> we spend virtually nothing
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 386.07 394.16 <NA> to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 394.54 404.3 <NA> and make no mistake about it it 's not a question of if but when these bugs are going to continue to evolve and they 're going to threaten the world 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 405.13 409.42 <NA> are our best defense <unk> so if we want to be able to to prevent
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 409.18 418.5 <NA> epidemics like ebola we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation <unk> 
SethBerkley_2015 1 SethBerkley_2015 418.25 429.6 <NA> and we need to view this then as the ultimate deterrent something we make sure is available <unk> but at the same time praying we never have to use it
