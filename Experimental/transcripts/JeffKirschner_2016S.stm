JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 46.21 50.62 <NA> so i thought <unk> why not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 50.41 53.95 <NA> to the entire planet <unk> and that was the inspiration for
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 55.2 63.67 <NA> <unk> the vision is to create a litter free world let me show you how it started i took a picture of a cigarette using instagram

JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 73.71 79.97 <NA> and two at the end of a few days i had fifty photos on my phone and i had picked up each piece and i realized
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 80.11 83.2 <NA> <unk> that i was keeping a record of the positive impact
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 83.04 92.66 <NA> i was having on the planet that 's fifty less things that you might see or you might step on or some bird might eat so i started telling people what i was doing <unk> 
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 92.89 94.73 <NA> and they started
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 94.24 100.02 <NA> participating one day <unk> this photo showed up
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 103.67 110.07 <NA> <unk> was more than just pretty pictures we were becoming a community that was collecting data 
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 110.3 117.46 <NA> each photo tells a story it tells us who picked up what a geotag tells us where
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 117.01 120.72 <NA> and a time stamp tells us when so
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 120.71 129.37 <NA> i built a google map and started plotting the points where pieces were being picked up and through that process the community grew
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 130.35 136.39 <NA> <unk> and the data grew my two kids go to school right in that bullseye 
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 136.53 142.99 <NA> litter it 's blending into the background of our lives but what if we brought it to the forefront

JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 147.32 151.25 <NA> and our school yards how might we use that data
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 151.03 154.73 <NA> to make a difference <unk> well let me show you the first is with

JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 155.77 163.61 <NA> san francisco wanted to understand what percentage of litter was cigarettes <unk> why to create a tax <unk> 
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 163.54 173.15 <NA> so they put a couple of people in the streets with pencils and clipboards who walked around collecting information which led to a 20 cent tax on all cigarette sales <unk> 
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 173.26 175.13 <NA> and then they got sued

JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 219.42 224.92 <NA> now during that process i learned two things one instagram is not the right tool 
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 225.12 229.94 <NA> so we built an app <unk> and two if you think about it <unk> every city in the world

JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 239.05 246.08 <NA> if you could generate a revenue stream just by understanding the percentage of cigarettes well what about coffee cups
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 246.1 249.98 <NA> or soda cans or plastic bottles 
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 250.61 253.14 <NA> <unk> you could fingerprint san francisco well how about oakland

JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 281.16 288.56 <NA> most of that brand 's litter were their own hot sauce packets and most of those hot sauce packets

JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 292.86 298.54 <NA> and the path to the solution well maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request
JeffKirschner_2016S 1 JeffKirschner_2016S 298.11 304.82 <NA> or installs bulk dispensers or comes up with more sustainable packaging how does a brand take an
