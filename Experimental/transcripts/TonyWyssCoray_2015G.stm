TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 54.47 59.96 <NA> in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 59.78 63.64 <NA> and how we may treat age related diseases in the future 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 63.69 75.08 <NA> it started with experiments that showed in a recent number of studies about growing that animals old mice that share a blood supply with
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 75.04 84.92 <NA> <unk> young mice can get rejuvenated this is similar to what you might see in humans in siamese twins and i know this sounds a bit creepy <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 84.82 86.22 <NA> but
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 85.83 91.13 <NA> what tom rando a stem cell researcher reported in two thousand and seven 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 91.13 97.53 <NA> was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it 's exposed to young blood
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 97.29 104.55 <NA> through common circulation this was reproduced by amy wagers at harvard a few years later
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 104.96 106.01 <NA> <unk> then showed
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 105.7 112.53 <NA> that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed in the pancreas the liver and the heart <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 112.49 119.82 <NA> but what i 'm most excited about <unk> and several other labs as well is that this may even apply to the brain <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 120.23 127.51 <NA> so what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 130.55 137.14 <NA> and a brain that functions better <unk> and i repeat an old mouse
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 137.14 141.55 <NA> that gets young blood through shared circulation
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 141.3 150.02 <NA> looks younger and functions younger in its brain so when we get older we can look at different aspects of human cognition
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 150.19 155.72 <NA> <unk> and you can see on this slide here we can look at reasoning <unk> verbal ability and so forth <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 155.71 161.88 <NA> and up to around age fifty or sixty these functions are all intact <unk> and
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 161.49 166.34 <NA> as i look at the young audience here in the room we 're all still fine 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 166 174.99 <NA> but it 's scary to see how all these curves go south <unk> and as we get older <unk> diseases such as alzheimer 's and
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 175 176.58 <NA> <unk> others may develop 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 176.54 188.4 <NA> we know that with age the connections between neurons the way neurons talk to each other the synapses they start to deteriorate neurons die the brain starts to shrink <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 188.4 192.96 <NA> and there 's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 193.1 204.97 <NA> one big problem we have to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level is that we can 't study the brains in detail in living people
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 205.5 213.98 <NA> we can do cognitive tests we can do imaging all kinds of sophisticated testing <unk> but we usually have to wait
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 213.8 220.67 <NA> until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 220.67 224.02 <NA> this is what neuropathologists do for example 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 223.86 229.82 <NA> so how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 229.96 243.8 <NA> <unk> could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body <unk> so if the body ages or gets sick does that affect the brain 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 243.8 248.72 <NA> and vice versa as the brain gets older <unk> does that influence the rest of the body <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 248.59 250.35 <NA> and what connects
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 250.43 253.83 <NA> <unk> all the different tissues in the body is blood 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 253.88 266.83 <NA> blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen for example the red blood cells or fights infectious diseases <unk> but it also carries carries messenger
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 266.64 274.96 <NA> molecules hormone like factors that transport information from one cell to another from one tissue to
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 276.03 285.52 <NA> <unk> including the brain <unk> so if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age <unk> can we learn something about the brain <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 285.15 288.73 <NA> we know that as we get older <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 288.73 300.11 <NA> the blood changes as well so these hormone like factors change as we get older <unk> and by and large factors that we know are required for the development of tissues for the maintenance
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 300 303.86 <NA> <unk> of tissues they start to decrease as we get older <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 303.55 312.06 <NA> while factors involved in repair in injury and in inflammation they increase as we get older <unk> so there 's this
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 311.58 316.37 <NA> unbalance of good and bad factors if you will 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 316.51 324.99 <NA> and to illustrate what we can do potentially with that i want to talk you through an experiment that we did we had almost three hundred blood samples from
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 328.88 331.3 <NA> <unk> and we measured over one hundred of these
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 331.09 337.23 <NA> communication factors these hormone like proteins that transport information between tissues <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 336.77 349.87 <NA> and what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group <unk> about half the factors changed significantly <unk> so our body lives in a very different environment as we get older when it comes to these factors 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 349.87 354.64 <NA> and using statistical or bioinformatics programs we could
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 354.99 359.15 <NA> <unk> discover those factors that best predict age in a way
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 360.33 363.82 <NA> <unk> relative age of a person and the way this looks
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 363.39 369.49 <NA> is shown in this graph so on the one axis you see the actual
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 369.26 373.93 <NA> age a person lived <unk> the chronological age so how many years they lived 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 373.93 379.73 <NA> and then we take these top factors that i showed you and we calculate their relative age
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 379.96 382.07 <NA> <unk> their biological age <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 382.21 391.73 <NA> and what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation <unk> so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person <unk> but what 's really exciting
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 391.6 395.42 <NA> are the outliers as they so often are in life 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 395.44 403.07 <NA> you can see here <unk> the person i highlighted with the green dot is about seventy years of age
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 402.64 404.94 <NA> but seems to have a biological
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 404.87 413.82 <NA> <unk> age <unk> if what we 're doing here is really true of only about forty five so is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 413.69 424.08 <NA> but more importantly is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age related disease and will have a long life will live to one hundred or more 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 423.92 424.93 <NA> on the other
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 426.99 432.79 <NA> <unk> highlighted with the red dot is not even forty but has a biological age of <unk>
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 433.76 444.37 <NA> is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age related disease so in our lab we 're trying to understand these factors better <unk> and many other groups are trying to understand <unk>
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 444.32 449.93 <NA> what are the true aging factors and can we learn something about them to possibly predict
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 452.23 464.39 <NA> <unk> so what i 've shown you so far is simply correlational <unk> right you can just say well these factors change with age but you don 't really know if they do something about aging <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 464.56 473.45 <NA> so what i 'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 473.35 474.96 <NA> and that 's where we come back to
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 477.98 480.87 <NA> <unk> is done in mice by
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 480.47 484.48 <NA> surgically connecting the two mice together <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 484.48 494.1 <NA> and that leads then to a shared blood system where we can now ask how does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 493.7 504.19 <NA> and for this purpose we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20 year old people and old mice that are roughly sixty five years old in human years
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 504.96 513.14 <NA> <unk> what we found is quite remarkable <unk> we find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 512.93 517.9 <NA> there 's an increased activity of the synapses the connections between neurons 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 517.9 523.61 <NA> there are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 523.37 525.05 <NA> and there 's less of this bad
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 531.85 541.13 <NA> <unk> the brains of these animals <unk> so when we connect them there are actually no cells going into the old brain in this model <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 540.94 550.08 <NA> instead we 've reasoned then that it must be the soluble factors <unk> so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma <unk> and
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 550.04 560.29 <NA> <unk> inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 560.29 568.56 <NA> as mice get older <unk> like us humans they have memory problems it 's just harder to detect them but i 'll show you in a minute how we do that
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 568.28 575.38 <NA> but we wanted to take this one step further one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 579.9 588.43 <NA> <unk> human plasma young human plasma <unk> and as a control saline and injected it into old mice and asked 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 588.33 593.8 <NA> can we again rejuvenate these old mice can we make them smarter <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 593.61 600.05 <NA> and to do this we used a test it 's called a barnes maze this is a big table that has lots of holes in
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 602.02 603.87 <NA> <unk> guide marks around it <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 603.87 614.03 <NA> and there 's a bright light as on this stage here <unk> the mice hate this and they try to escape and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 613.6 619.79 <NA> where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 619.51 625.02 <NA> so we teach them over several days to find this space on these cues in the space and you
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 625 634.47 <NA> can compare this for humans to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping many of us have probably
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 634.04 635.74 <NA> had some problems
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 635.56 638.75 <NA> with that so let 's look at an old mouse here 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 638.53 643.05 <NA> this is an old mouse that has memory problems as you 'll notice in a moment 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 642.82 645.43 <NA> it just looks into every hole <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 645.43 653.7 <NA> but it didn 't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 653.39 654.97 <NA> in stark contrast
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 655.43 667.72 <NA> this mouse here is a sibling of the same age but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks with small injections every three days <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 667.26 678.25 <NA> and as you noticed it almost looks around where am i and then walks straight to that hole and escapes so it could remember where that hole was 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 678.24 679.94 <NA> so by all means
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 679.93 687.47 <NA> <unk> this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated it functions more like a younger mouse and it also suggests that there is something
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 687.47 694.67 <NA> not only in young mouse plasma but in young human plasma that has the capacity
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 694.24 700.05 <NA> to help this old brain so to summarize we find the old mouse and its brain
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 702.29 707.64 <NA> <unk> not set in stone we can actually change them it can be rejuvenated 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 707.18 717.09 <NA> young blood factors can reverse aging and what i didn 't show you in this model the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 717.08 721.14 <NA> so there are old blood factors that can accelerate aging 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 721.25 724.81 <NA> and most importantly humans may have
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 725.97 728.59 <NA> <unk> because we can take young human blood
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 728.19 736.36 <NA> and have a similar effect old human blood i didn 't show you does not have this effect <unk> it does not make the mice younger 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 736.56 744.14 <NA> so is this magic transferable to humans <unk> we 're running a small clinical study at stanford 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 744.14 748.31 <NA> where we treat alzheimer 's patients with mild disease

TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 760.85 772.52 <NA> we test them cognitively <unk> and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living what we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment <unk> 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 772.3 779.52 <NA> and if that 's the case that could give us hope that what i showed you works in mice might also work in humans
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 780.38 783.15 <NA> <unk> now i don 't think we will live forever

TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 791.14 794.24 <NA> and if we can turn it back on a little bit 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 794.08 798.9 <NA> maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects 
TonyWyssCoray_2015G 1 TonyWyssCoray_2015G 798.9 808.12 <NA> we can produce these factors synthetically and we can treat diseases of aging such as alzheimer 's disease or other dementias <unk> thank you very much
