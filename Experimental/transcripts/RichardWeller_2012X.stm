RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 496.52 500.02 <NA> i 'm not sure exactly how much one of the subjects here was my

RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 509.24 521.83 <NA> and the other thing i should mention was there was no change in vitamin d this is separate from vitamin d so vitamin d is good for you it stops rickets it prevents calcium metabolism important stuff but this is a separate mechanism from vitamin d 
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 521.76 529.97 <NA> now one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place if your leg is chopped off and you lose blood your body
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 530.11 539.66 <NA> <unk> will clamp down increase the heart rate do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up that is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle <unk> so what we 've next done
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 539.35 545.51 <NA> is we 've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation so we 've measured this is again notice no tail
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 545.51 550.08 <NA> and and hairless this is a medical student <unk> in the arm
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 550.04 555.75 <NA> <unk> you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it 
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 555.47 565.54 <NA> and what we 've shown is that doing a sham irradiation this is the thick line here this is shining uv on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don 't hit the skin <unk> 
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 565.54 579.97 <NA> there is no change in blood flow in dilatation of the blood vessels <unk> but the active irradiation during the uv and for an hour after it there is dilation of the blood vessels this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure by which
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 579.99 583.52 <NA> <unk> you dilate the coronary arteries also to let the blood be supplied with the heart 
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 583.52 591.85 <NA> so here <unk> further data that ultraviolet that 's sunlight has benefits on the blood flow and and the cardiovascular system <unk> 
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 592.08 594.94 <NA> so we thought we 'd just kind of model
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 594.6 597.34 <NA> different amounts of uv
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 597.15 604.97 <NA> hit different parts of the earth at different times of year <unk> so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 605.2 607.79 <NA> <unk> the nitrates nitrites nitrosothiols in the skin
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 607.78 616.83 <NA> cleave to release no different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that so you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that 
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 616.62 626.42 <NA> and you can look so if you live on the equator the sun comes straight overhead it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere in winter or summer it 's the same amount of light if you live up here 
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 626.11 627.71 <NA> in summer
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 627.4 629.94 <NA> the sun is coming fairly directly down

RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 640.8 649.99 <NA> so what you can do is you can multiply those data by the no that 's released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 652.26 657.25 <NA> <unk> if you 're on the equator here that 's these two lines here the red line and the purple line
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 657.03 663.09 <NA> the amount of nitric oxide <unk> that 's released is the area under the curve it 's the area in this space here

RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 668.76 676.43 <NA> so ventura is in southern california in summer you might as well be at the equator it 's great lots of no is released ventura

RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 718.25 725.23 <NA> we think they 're then stored in the skin <unk> and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects

RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 734.05 746.21 <NA> i actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight yes sunlight is the is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer <unk> 
RichardWeller_2012X 1 RichardWeller_2012X 746.03 750.92 <NA> but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher than deaths from skin cancer <unk>
