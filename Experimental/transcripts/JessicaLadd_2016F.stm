JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 31.91 36.93 <NA> the next day hannah wakes up with a pounding headache 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 36.77 43.78 <NA> she can only remember the night in flashes but what she does remember is throwing up in the hall
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 43.57 45.57 <NA> outside mike 's room
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 45.95 53.2 <NA> and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her wanting it to stop then shakily stumbling home

JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 71.04 75.02 <NA> less than ten percent will ever report their assault to their
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 75.85 82.73 <NA> <unk> or to the police and those who do on average wait eleven months to make the report 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 83.53 92.06 <NA> hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own but when she sees mike taking girls home from parties she 's worried about them <unk>

JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 100.79 103.06 <NA> <unk> and this is not an unlikely scenario
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 102.88 109.02 <NA> because ninety percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 108.65 117.24 <NA> but with such low reporting rates it 's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported much less anything happen if they are 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 116.75 120.31 <NA> in fact only six percent
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 120.1 125.11 <NA> of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 127.56 136.6 <NA> <unk> percent chance that they 'll get away with it this means there 's practically no deterrent to assault in the united states <unk> 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 137.67 148.99 <NA> now i 'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training i 'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 148.74 154.16 <NA> so this to me is a tragic but a solvable problem
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 155.23 164.21 <NA> <unk> so when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago <unk> it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change <unk> and so we did 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 164.08 170.78 <NA> we started by talking to college survivors and what they wish they 'd had in college is pretty simple 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 170.38 176.48 <NA> they wanted a website one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 176.29 179.97 <NA> with clearly written information about their reporting options
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 180.26 188.58 <NA> with the ability to electronically report their assault rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them

JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 197.09 200.05 <NA> and lastly <unk> and perhaps most critically
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 200.49 206.47 <NA> <unk> with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 206.43 212.08 <NA> you see knowing that you weren 't the only one changes everything it changes the way you frame your own experience 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 212.08 220.12 <NA> it changes the way you think about your perpetrator it means that if you do come forward you 'll have someone else 's back and they 'll have yours 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 220.38 225.02 <NA> we created a website that actually does this and we launched it [ 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 226.33 231.35 <NA> <unk> on two college campuses <unk> and we included a unique matching system
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 231.01 233.23 <NA> where if mike 's first victim
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 233.07 242.51 <NA> had come forward <unk> saved her record entered into the matching system and named mike <unk> and mike 's second victim had done the same thing a few months later 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 242.08 249.99 <NA> they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 250.16 252.6 <NA> <unk> for investigation and follow up 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 253.13 261.54 <NA> if a system like this had existed for hannah and her peers <unk> it 's more likely that they would have reported that they would have been believed <unk> 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 261.17 267.21 <NA> and that mike would have been kicked off campus gone to jail or at least gotten the help that he needed 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 267.44 273.49 <NA> and if we were able to stop repeat offenders like mike after just their second assault
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 273.31 279.97 <NA> following a match survivors like hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place we

JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 287.58 292.78 <NA> and because we 're creating a real deterrent to assault for perhaps the first time 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 292.44 296.59 <NA> maybe the mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 298.14 300.26 <NA> the type of system i 'm describing
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 300.58 305.36 <NA> <unk> the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow <unk> 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 305.35 315.5 <NA> meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre agreed upon conditions are met such as a match 
JessicaLadd_2016F 1 JessicaLadd_2016F 315.1 324.23 <NA> the application that we built is for college campuses <unk> but the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace
