SusanEtlinger_2014S 1 SusanEtlinger_2014S 189.79 195.55 <NA> and what it reminds us is that language is created by people 
SusanEtlinger_2014S 1 SusanEtlinger_2014S 195.55 204.91 <NA> and people are messy and we 're complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this twenty four seven in many many languages and then as soon as we

SusanEtlinger_2014S 1 SusanEtlinger_2014S 257.8 268.98 <NA> it 's not just big data that causes challenges of interpretation because let 's face it we human beings have a very rich history of taking any amount of data no matter how small and screwing it up

SusanEtlinger_2014S 1 SusanEtlinger_2014S 410.84 418.38 <NA> communication was hard for isaac <unk> and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know
