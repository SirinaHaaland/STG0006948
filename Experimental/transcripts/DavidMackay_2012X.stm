DavidMackay_2012X 1 DavidMackay_2012X 611.2 622.17 <NA> that means if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the united kingdom on the scale of today 's consumption you need to be imagining renewable facilities
DavidMackay_2012X 1 DavidMackay_2012X 622.17 629.97 <NA> that are country sized not the entire country but a fraction of the country a substantial fraction there are
