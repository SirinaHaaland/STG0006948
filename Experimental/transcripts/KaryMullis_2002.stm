KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 871.7 879.88 <NA> so i i went to the drug store and i tried to buy some potassium perchlorate and it wasn 't unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 879.81 887.02 <NA> <unk> drug store and buy chemicals nowadays it 's no ma 'am check your shoes and like
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 887.34 895.04 <NA> but then it wasn 't they didn 't have any but the guy had i said what kind of salts or potassium do you have you know and he had potassium nitrate and i said
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 895.04 897.83 <NA> that might do the same thing whatever it is
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 897.62 904.64 <NA> i 'm sure it 's got to do with rockets or it wouldn 't be in that manual and so i i did some experiments you know i started
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 904.9 913.53 <NA> <unk> tiny amounts of potassium nitrate and sugar which was readily available and i mixed it in different proportions and i tried to light it on fire
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 914.64 924.26 <NA> just to see what would happen if you mixed it together and it they burned it burned kind of slow but it made a nice smell compared to other rocket fuels i had tried that all had sulfur in them
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 923.8 924.99 <NA> and it smelt
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 927.11 930.52 <NA> <unk> and then i tried the melting business and i melted it
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 930.31 937.63 <NA> and then it it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid brown and then it cooled down to a brick hard substance
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 937.45 941.04 <NA> that when you lit that it went off like a bat
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 941.04 949.56 <NA> i mean the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down you 'd light it and it would just start dancing around the yard and i said there is a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 950.6 954.61 <NA> so i started developing you know george 's dad
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 954.89 959.17 <NA> had a lot of help i just had my brother but i it took me about
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 959.64 969.86 <NA> it took me about i 'd say six months to finally figure out all the little things there 's a lot of little things involved in making a rocket that it will actually work even after you have the fuel
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 969.86 973.87 <NA> but you do it by what i just you know you do experiments
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 973.47 979.94 <NA> and you write down things sometimes you make observations you know and then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 979.9 987.51 <NA> <unk> works and it was i was following all the rules i didn 't know what the rules were i 'm a natural born scientist i guess or
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 987.33 993.15 <NA> some kind of a throwback to the seventeenth century whatever but at any rate we finally did

KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1001.51 1002.56 <NA> <unk> had not
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1002.19 1008.89 <NA> i mean we weren 't frightened by it we should have been because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1008.89 1014.15 <NA> and it was powerful you know and once in a while they would blow up but
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1014.02 1017.09 <NA> i wasn 't worried by the way about you know
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1016.6 1024.53 <NA> the explosion causing the destruction of the planet i hadn 't heard about the ten ways that we should be afraid of the by the way
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1026.27 1028.89 <NA> <unk> i could have thought i 'd better not do this because
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1028.7 1037.33 <NA> they say not to you know and i 'd better get permissionfrom the government if i 'd have waited around for that i would have never the frog would have died
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1037.33 1038.33 <NA> you know
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1038.57 1048.87 <NA> at any rate i bring it up because it 's a good story and he said tell personal things you know and that 's a personal i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife but that would be too personal wouldn 't it
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1049.43 1050.8 <NA> so
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1050.63 1054.88 <NA> so i 've got something else that 's not personal but that process is what
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1055.02 1061.15 <NA> <unk> think of as science see where you start with some idea and then instead of like looking up
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1061.14 1070.81 <NA> every authority that you 've ever heard of i sometimes you do that if you 're going to write a paper later you want to figure out who else has worked on it but in the actual process you <unk>
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1070.71 1079.58 <NA> <unk> get an idea like when i got the idea one night that i could amplify dna with two oligonucleotides and i could make lots of copies of some little piece of dna
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1080.04 1082.74 <NA> the thinking for that was about twenty minutes
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1082.74 1092.03 <NA> while i was driving my car and then instead of going i went back and i did talk to people about it but if i 'd listened to what i heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1093.67 1100.11 <NA> i would have abandoned it you know if i had gone back looking for an authority figure who could tell me if it would work or not he would have said no
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1100.73 1101.78 <NA> <unk> probably won 't
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1101.5 1112.81 <NA> because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody 's goddamn way of doing molecular biology nobody want a chemist to come in and poke around in their stuff like that and change things
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1112.63 1115.57 <NA> but if if you go to authority and you always don 't you don 't
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1115.57 1130 <NA> always get the right answer see but i knew you 'd go into the lab and you 'd try to make it work yourself and then you 're the authority and you can say i know it works because right there in that tube is where it happened and here on this gel there 's a little band there that i know
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1129.96 1134.53 <NA> <unk> that 's dna and that 's the dna i wanted to amplify so there so it does work
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1134.33 1144.67 <NA> you know that 's how you do science and then you say well what can make it work better and then you figure out better and better ways to do it but you always work from from like facts that you have made <unk>
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1144.62 1152.99 <NA> available to you by doing experiments things that you could do on a stage and no tricky shit behind the thing i mean it 's all you 've got to be very honest
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1154.98 1160.76 <NA> i mean you can 't make up results and then do another experiment based on that one so you have to be honest
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1160.39 1165.71 <NA> and i 'm basically honest i have a fairly bad memory and dishonesty would always get me in trouble
KaryMullis_2002 1 KaryMullis_2002 1165.71 1174.98 <NA> if i like so i 've just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive and that sort of leads to that kind of science now let 's see
