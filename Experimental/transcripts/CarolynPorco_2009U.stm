CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 14.99 24.54 <NA> that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small

CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 32.46 46.06 <NA> this is the south polar region with the famous <unk> tiger stripe fractures crossing the south pole <unk> and seen just recently in late two thousand and eight here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 45.87 52.69 <NA> is experiencing the onset of august and eventually winter <unk> and i also reported that we 'd made this
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 54.98 69.71 <NA> once in a lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole <unk> consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane 
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 69.71 79.88 <NA> and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 79.81 82.55 <NA> <unk> surface but we weren 't really sure <unk> 
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 82.09 92.7 <NA> however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 92.52 99.9 <NA> were so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on enceladus we 've flown the cassini spacecraft
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 99.71 104.88 <NA> by this moon now several times flying closer and deeper into these

CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 115.15 125.05 <NA> this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported while they 're not amino acids we 're now finding things like propane and benzene
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 125.1 127.59 <NA> <unk> hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde 
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 127.6 139.61 <NA> and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 139.25 143.99 <NA> pockets of liquid water but that that liquid water is in contact with rock <unk> 
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 143.99 150.17 <NA> and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 151.81 154.17 <NA> <unk> we are very encouraged by these results 
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 153.99 160.55 <NA> and we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon 
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 160.55 166.62 <NA> under the south pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms 
CarolynPorco_2009U 1 CarolynPorco_2009U 166.4 174.09 <NA> whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter <unk> and that will have to await the arrival back
