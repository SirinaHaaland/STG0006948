RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 13.93 19.01 <NA> <unk> i get a show of hands how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 20.02 24.84 <NA> that 's pretty good well it turns out that you share that experience with more than
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 25 26.94 <NA> <unk> three billion people every year <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 26.94 36.87 <NA> and when we put so many people in all these metal tubes that fly all over the world sometimes things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 36.62 51.15 <NA> i first actually got into this topic when i heard about the ebola outbreak last year <unk> and it turns out that although ebola spreads through these more range limited large droplet routes there 's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 51.15 53.07 <NA> the worst part is 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 52.58 54.67 <NA> when we take a look at some of the numbers
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 55.01 57.98 <NA> pretty scary so with h1n1 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 57.74 64.19 <NA> there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease to seventeen other people <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 64.19 75.25 <NA> and then there was this other guy with sars who managed to go on a three hour flight and spread the disease to twenty two other people that 's not exactly my idea of a great superpower 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 75.15 79.58 <NA> when we take a look at this what we also find is that it 's very difficult to
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 80.01 81.39 <NA> pre screen for these diseases 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 81.39 91.23 <NA> so when someone actually goes on a plane they could be sick and they could actually be in this latency period in which they could actually have the disease but not exhibit any symptoms <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 91.02 99.87 <NA> and they could in turn spread the disease to many other people in the cabin how that actually works is that right now we 've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 100 111.18 <NA> <unk> the cabin as you see in blue <unk> and then also that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate ninety nine point nine seven percent of pathogens near the outlets
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 110.99 123.09 <NA> what happens right now though is that we have this mixing airflow pattern <unk> so if someone were to actually sneeze that air would get swirled around multiple times before it even has a chance to go out through the filter <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 123.29 124.93 <NA> so i thought clearly 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 128.22 133.09 <NA> <unk> i didn 't have the money to go out and buy a plane <unk> so i decided to build a computer instead 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 132.63 144.67 <NA> it actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics what we 're able to do is create these simulations that give us higher resolutions than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 144.36 154.13 <NA> and so how essentially this works is you would start out with these 2d drawings these are floating around in technical papers around the internet i take that and then i put it into
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 155.02 165.26 <NA> <unk> 3d modeling software really building that 3d model and then i divide that model that i just built into these tiny pieces essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 165.01 174.72 <NA> and then i tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin <unk> throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 177.83 181.92 <NA> <unk> with the conventional cabin is this you 'll notice the middle person sneezing 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 182.27 186.84 <NA> and we go splat it goes right into people 's faces <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 186.71 194.61 <NA> it 's pretty disgusting from the front you 'll notice those two passengers sitting next to the central passenger not exactly having a great time <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 194.15 200.46 <NA> and when we take a look at that from the side you 'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin the
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 201.53 204.1 <NA> first thing i thought was this is no good
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 205.01 211.24 <NA> i actually conducted more than thirty two different simulations and ultimately i came up with this solution right here 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 210.84 221.17 <NA> this is what i call a patent pending global inlet director with this we 're able to reduce pathogen transmission by about fifty five times and increase fresh air inhalation by about <unk>
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 221.07 229.79 <NA> <unk> one hundred and ninety percent so how this actually works is we would install this piece of composite material into these existing spots that are already in the plane
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 230.05 237.11 <NA> <unk> so it 's very cost effective to install and we can do this directly overnight all we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you 're good to go 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 236.92 247.11 <NA> and the results that we get are absolutely amazing instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns we can create these walls of air that come down in between
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 247.06 254.73 <NA> <unk> the passengers to create personalized breathing zones so you 'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again but this time we 're able to effectively push that down
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 254.84 262.92 <NA> <unk> to the filters for elimination <unk> and same thing from the side you 'll notice we 're able to directly push those pathogens down 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 263.12 273.46 <NA> so if you take a look again now at the same scenario but with this innovation installed you 'll notice the middle passenger sneezes and this time we 're pushing that straight down
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 273.24 276.42 <NA> into the outlet before it gets a chance to
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 276.08 279.91 <NA> to infect any other people <unk> so you 'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 279.84 285.61 <NA> <unk> guy are breathing virtually no pathogens at all take a look at that from the side as well <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 285.61 292.72 <NA> you see a very efficient system <unk> and in short with this system <unk> we win <unk> when we take a look
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 292.26 302.83 <NA> at what this means what we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes but also if the window seat passenger sneezes or if the aisle seat passenger sneezes <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 302.7 304.28 <NA> and so
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 303.97 304.97 <NA> with this solution
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 305.11 309.09 <NA> <unk> what does this mean for the world <unk> well <unk> when we take a look at
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 308.85 317.16 <NA> this from the computer simulation into real life we can see with this 3d model that i built over here essentially using 3d printing 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 317.16 321.95 <NA> we can see those same airflow patterns coming down right to the passengers 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 322.42 325.11 <NA> in the past the sars epidemic
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 325.22 333.72 <NA> <unk> actually cost the world about forty billion dollars and in the future a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars <unk> 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 333.72 339.06 <NA> so before it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 338.75 349.02 <NA> spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something but now we 're able to install something essentially overnight and see results right <unk>
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 348.92 354.94 <NA> <unk> away <unk> so it 's really now a matter of taking this through to certification flight testing and going through all
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 354.87 361.69 <NA> <unk> these regulatory approvals processes but it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions 
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 361.69 370.9 <NA> and two years ago <unk> even this project would not have happened just because the technology then wouldn 't have supported it but now with
RaymondWang_2015Y 1 RaymondWang_2015Y 370.47 382.82 <NA> advanced computing and how developed our internet is it 's really the golden era for innovation and so the question i ask all of you today is why wait <unk> together we can build the future today
