DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 39.62 47.04 <NA> i have always loved math and science later coding and so i decided to study computer programming in college 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 46.85 52.56 <NA> in my junior year my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 52.4 54.91 <NA> it was the first computer animation any of
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 54.99 64.78 <NA> <unk> had ever seen i watched these films in wonder transfixed fireworks going off in my head thinking that is what i want to do with my life 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 64.47 75.34 <NA> the idea that all the math science and code i had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories i connected with was pure magic for me 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 75.66 79.97 <NA> just two years later i started working at the place that made those films <unk> pixar animation
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 79.99 88.55 <NA> <unk> studios <unk> it was here i learned how we actually execute those films to create our movies we create a three dimensional world inside the computer 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 88.42 92.36 <NA> we start with a point that makes a line that makes a face
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 91.99 97.22 <NA> that creates characters or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 96.85 101.96 <NA> and because it 's a three dimensional world we can move a camera around inside that world <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 102.49 104.73 <NA> i was fascinated by all of it
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 104.9 108.03 <NA> but then i got my first taste of lighting 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 108.05 122.28 <NA> lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three dimensional world <unk> i actually have icons of lights i move around in there here you can see i 've added a light <unk> i 'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software turn on shadows and placing the light <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 121.79 129.58 <NA> as i place a light <unk> i think about what it might look like in real life <unk> but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 130.5 137.98 <NA> so it might look like this at first <unk> but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 137.67 140.56 <NA> in rough form it might look like this 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 140.79 143.68 <NA> and in final form like this
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 146.28 154.97 <NA> <unk> there 's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it it 's where we go from this to
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 154.9 163.88 <NA> <unk> this it 's the moment where all the pieces come together and suddenly the world comes to life as if it 's an actual place that exists 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 163.51 169.25 <NA> this moment never gets old especially for that little seven year old girl that wanted to be an artist <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 169.15 173.63 <NA> as i learned to light i learned about using light to help tell story

DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 176.74 178.26 <NA> to create the mood

DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 187.76 189.75 <NA> did you see wall e

DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 193.04 200.46 <NA> as you can see we can create any world that we want inside the computer <unk> we can make a world with monsters 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 200.33 204.88 <NA> with robots that fall in love <unk> we can even make pigs fly
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 209.88 216.4 <NA> while this is an incredible thing this untethered artistic freedom <unk> it can create chaos <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 216.4 218.06 <NA> it can create
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 217.64 223.06 <NA> unbelievable worlds unbelievable movement things that are jarring to the audience 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 223.06 229.31 <NA> so to combat this we tether ourselves with science <unk> we use science and the world we know as a backbone
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 229.96 233.51 <NA> <unk> ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 233.26 241.13 <NA> finding nemo is an excellent example of this a major portion of the movie takes place underwater <unk> but how do you make it look underwater 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 240.76 246.8 <NA> in early research and development we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 246.37 251.06 <NA> then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 251.05 254.94 <NA> one of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 254.98 262.23 <NA> so we coded up a light that mimics this physics first the visibility of the water <unk> and then what happens with the color 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 262.01 274.05 <NA> objects close to the eye have their full rich colors <unk> as light travels deeper into the water <unk> we lose the red wavelengths then the green wavelengths leaving us with blue at the far depths 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 274.16 279.82 <NA> in this clip you can see two other important elements the first is the surge and swell
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 279.96 284.71 <NA> <unk> the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 284.25 286.67 <NA> the second is the caustics 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 286.67 295.72 <NA> these are the ribbons of light like you might see on the bottom of a pool that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean 's surface 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 296.52 304.91 <NA> here we have the fog beams these give us color depth cues but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don 't see the water surface the
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 304.87 317.48 <NA> <unk> other really cool thing you can see here is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics so that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light it appears and disappears <unk> lending a subtle magical sparkle to the underwater 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 318.01 324.87 <NA> you can see how we 're using the science the physics of water light and movement to tether that
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 326.51 333.56 <NA> <unk> but we are not beholden to it we considered each of these elements and which ones had to be scientifically accurate
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 333.34 337.77 <NA> and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 337.37 344.14 <NA> we realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with so here 's a traditionally colored underwater scene <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 344.14 349.65 <NA> but here we can take sydney harbor and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what 's happening 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 349.88 354.91 <NA> in this scene it 's really important we see deep into the underwater <unk> so we understand what the east
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 354.84 364.66 <NA> <unk> australian current is that the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride <unk> so we pushed the visibility of the water well past anything you would ever see in real life <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 364.32 376.72 <NA> because in the end we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world we 're trying to create a believable world one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 376.89 379.88 <NA> we use science to create something wonderful
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 380.02 385.1 <NA> we use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 385.09 393.8 <NA> this guy wall e is a great example of that he finds beauty in the simplest things <unk> but when he came in to lighting we knew we had a big problem <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 393.46 399.96 <NA> we got so geeked out on making wall e this convincing robot that we made his binoculars practically optically
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 403.31 410.91 <NA> <unk> his binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has he doesn 't have a face or even traditional dialogue for that matter <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 410.45 416.37 <NA> so the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 416.03 422.7 <NA> we started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 422.45 424.06 <NA> he was starting to look
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 429.9 435.73 <NA> <unk> thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he 's capable of falling in love <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 436.14 439.86 <NA> so we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 439.87 446.12 <NA> trying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials but solve this reflection problem <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 445.9 454.97 <NA> so we started with the lenses here 's the flat front lens <unk> we have a concave lens and a convex lens and here you see all three together showing us all these
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 454.96 461.18 <NA> <unk> reflections <unk> we tried turning them down <unk> we tried blocking them nothing was working 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 461.32 470.61 <NA> you can see here sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes usually eve <unk> so we couldn 't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 470.61 479.06 <NA> so here we have eve on the first lens <unk> we put eve on the second lens <unk> it 's not working <unk> we turn it down <unk> it 's still not working <unk> 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 478.75 479.97 <NA> and then we have
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 479.99 489.42 <NA> <unk> our eureka moment we add a light to wall e that accidentally leaks into his eyes you can see it light up these gray aperture blades 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 489.71 495.81 <NA> suddenly those aperture blades are poking through that reflection the way nothing else has <unk>

DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 519.54 527.45 <NA> later in the movie towards the end wall e loses his personality essentially going dead this is the perfect time to bring back that
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 530.08 535.04 <NA> <unk> scene wall e comes back to life <unk> we bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back

DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 556.61 560.4 <NA> the jellyfish in finding nemo was one of those moments for me 
DanielleFeinberg_2015P 1 DanielleFeinberg_2015P 560.36 565.95 <NA> there are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together this was one of those scenes
