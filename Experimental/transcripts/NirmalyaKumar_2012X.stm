NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 145.7 151.54 <NA> <unk> will india go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 155.01 157.88 <NA> <unk> they said you know what indians don 't do innovation

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 188.09 192 <NA> so we started examining the r & d and innovation labs

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 193.31 202.42 <NA> well interestingly what you find there is usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the r & d center as they may call it and more often than not it 's an indian
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 204.95 210.32 <NA> i immediately said well but you could not have been educated in india right you must have gotten your education here

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 217.65 225.97 <NA> so we realized that maybe we had the wrong question <unk> and the right question is really can indians based out of india
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 225.54 229.79 <NA> do innovative work <unk> so off we went to india we made <unk> i think

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 345.19 354.46 <NA> is truly a remarkable figure <unk> when we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on they said we are working on global products
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 354.87 365.47 <NA> <unk> not working on localizing global products for india <unk> which is the usual role role of a local r & d they were working on truly global products and companies like microsoft <unk>

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 380.32 387.08 <NA> but of course <unk> as an end user you don 't see that because you only see the name of the company <unk> not where it was developed 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 388.51 397.85 <NA> the other thing we were told then was yes but you know the kind of work that is coming out of the indian r & d center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the u s r & d centers 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 397.85 400.05 <NA> so my coauthor phanish puranam who happens
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 400.04 402.57 <NA> <unk> to be one of the smartest people i know said
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 402.4 409.38 <NA> he 's going to do a study what he did was he looked at those companies that had an r <unk> & d center in usa and in india <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 409.67 417.52 <NA> and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the u s and a similar patent filed out of the same company 's subsidiary in india <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 417.52 424.9 <NA> so he 's now comparing the patents of r & d centers in the u s with r & d centers in india of the same company
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 424.72 429.88 <NA> to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 429.81 434.39 <NA> <unk> patents filed out of the u s centers <unk> interestingly <unk> what he finds is
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 437.1 441.59 <NA> <unk> is what we call forward citations how many times does a future patent
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 441.59 447.73 <NA> reference the older patent he finds something very interesting <unk> what we find is
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 447.24 452.48 <NA> that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 454.93 461.75 <NA> <unk> to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an indian subsidiary of the same company within that company <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 461.32 471.47 <NA> so within the company <unk> there 's no difference in the forward citation rates of their indian subsidiaries versus their u s subsidiaries so that 's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of india the
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 471.47 473.28 <NA> second kind of invisible
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 473.1 479.97 <NA> innovation coming out of india is what we call outsourcing innovation to indian companies where many companies today

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 520.41 524.84 <NA> the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call process
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 525.25 529.49 <NA> <unk> because of an injection of intelligence by indian firms
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 530.17 540.47 <NA> process innovation is different from product innovation <unk> it 's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product but not a new product itself 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 541.15 543.23 <NA> only in india

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 568.58 577.93 <NA> and they start telling the boss how to do this job better and out of this process innovation comes product innovations which are then marketed around the world for example
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 579.84 589.54 <NA> <unk> call center company <unk> used to be a traditional call center company <unk> today they 're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone <unk> you can

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 591.48 593.77 <NA> what this phone call is about it
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 596.16 604.73 <NA> 's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the west <unk> and the last kind of innovation invisible innovation coming out
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 605.14 611.96 <NA> <unk> innovation coming out of india is what we call management innovation it 's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 611.83 615.51 <NA> and the most significant management innovation to come
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 615.3 624.6 <NA> out of india <unk> invented by the indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model <unk> what the global delivery model allows is <unk> it allows you to take previously

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 638.48 644.13 <NA> so what i 'm trying to say is what we are finding in our research is that if
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 643.97 646.27 <NA> products for end users

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 663.57 672.65 <NA> and so we developed three implications of this research <unk> the first is what we called sinking skill ladder <unk> and now i 'm going to go back
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 672.49 675.08 <NA> to where i started my conversation with you 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 675.04 683.51 <NA> <unk> which was about the flight of jobs <unk> now of course when we first as a multinational company <unk> decide to outsource jobs to india in the r & d <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 683.5 691.85 <NA> what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india the least sophisticated jobs <unk> just like tom friedman would predict <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 692.59 698.03 <NA> now what happens is when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 697.81 704.58 <NA> for innovation and for r & d work at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 705.08 707.44 <NA> which is where does the next step
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 707.44 717.21 <NA> of the ladder people come from within your company <unk> so you have two choices then either you bring the people from india into the developed world
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 716.72 721.08 <NA> to take positions in the next step of the ladder immigration
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 721.04 729.55 <NA> or you say there 's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in india <unk> why don 't we move the next step to india
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 730.29 732.34 <NA> what we are trying to say is
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 732.11 736.06 <NA> that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 736.32 743.93 <NA> you it 's a self perpetuating act because of the sinking skill ladder <unk> and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 743.75 749.96 <NA> you can 't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once you can 't be a professor without having been a student <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 750.01 759.23 <NA> <unk> you can 't be a consultant without having been a research associate <unk> so if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs at some stage the next step of the ladder has to follow <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 759.1 769.37 <NA> the second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the tmt the top management teams if the r <unk> & d talent is going to be based out of india and china <unk> and the largest growth <unk>
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 769.27 777.59 <NA> <unk> markets are going to be based out of india and china you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of india and china <unk> 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 780.05 782.34 <NA> <unk> 's where the important market leadership is 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 782.39 788.17 <NA> right and the last thing we point out in this slide which is you know that to this story there 's one caveat 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 788.17 791.67 <NA> india has the youngest growing population in the world 
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 792.02 799.18 <NA> this demographic dividend dividend is incredible <unk> but paradoxically there 's also the mirage of mighty labor pools

NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 809.61 818.89 <NA> so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 819.96 822.88 <NA> so finally i want to conclude
NirmalyaKumar_2012X 1 NirmalyaKumar_2012X 823.11 825.07 <NA> by showing you
