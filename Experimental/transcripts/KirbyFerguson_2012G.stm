KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 77.97 79.76 <NA> but i think these aren 't just the
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 79.69 81.54 <NA> <unk> components of remixing

KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 84.54 90.41 <NA> i think everything is a remix <unk> and i think this is a better way to conceive of creativity all right
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 91.12 99.99 <NA> let 's head back to one thousand nine hundred and sixty four and let 's hear where some of dylan 's early songs came from we 'll do some side by side comparisons here all right this first song you 're going to
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 102.89 104.41 <NA> <unk> 'll hear dylan 's masters of war
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 132.39 141.08 <NA> <unk> so that 's the same basic melody and overall structure this next one <unk> is the patriot game by dominic behan alongside that you 're going to hear with god on our side
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 177.44 184.8 <NA> <unk> so in this case dylan admits he must have heard the patriot game he forgot about it then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain he just thought it was his song 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 184.4 191.41 <NA> last one this is who 's going to buy you ribbons another traditional folk tune <unk> alongside that is don 't think twice it 's all right this one 's more about the lyric
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 225.07 233.16 <NA> <unk> there 's a lot of these it 's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed this is pretty typical among folk singers <unk> 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 232.98 240.7 <NA> here 's the advice of dylan 's idol woody guthrie the worlds are the important thing don 't worry about tunes take a tune <unk> sing high when they sing low 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 240.71 244.4 <NA> sing fast when they sing slow and you 've got a new tune applause
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 247.39 249.99 <NA> and that 's that 's what guthrie did right here
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 265.01 269.46 <NA> <unk> this case performed by the carter family guthrie adapted it into this land is your land 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 269.42 275.08 <NA> so bob dylan like all folk singers <unk> he copied melodies he transformed
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 275.49 280.78 <NA> <unk> he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 281.52 294.37 <NA> now american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others <unk> instead these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property <unk> 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 293.91 301.76 <NA> now <unk> creative works may indeed be kind of like property <unk> but it 's property that we 're all building on and creations can only take root and grow
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 301.6 303.14 <NA> once that ground has been prepared

KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 320.35 329.64 <NA> the iphone makes it debut apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 330.13 333.63 <NA> that 's multi touch controlling a device by touching its display 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 333.2 341.59 <NA> here is steve jobs introducing multi touch and making a rather foreboding joke steve jobs and we have invented a new technology called <unk>
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 342.71 348.34 <NA> you can do multi fingered gestures on it <unk> and boy have we patented it
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 354.72 363.49 <NA> <unk> earlier this is jeff han <unk> and i mean that 's multi touch it 's the same animal at least let 's hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology jeff han
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 363.66 369.2 <NA> multi touch sensing isn 't anything isn 't completely new i mean people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the ' 80s 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 369.2 375.41 <NA> the technology <unk> you know isn 't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 375.46 386.83 <NA> <unk> so he 's pretty frank about it not being new <unk> so it 's not multi touch as a whole that 's patented it 's the small parts of it that are and it 's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent

KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 405.26 411.63 <NA> i 'm only exaggerating a little bit it 's a broad patent now can someone own this idea now
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 411.23 417.43 <NA> back in the ' 80s there were no software patents <unk> and it was xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 417.43 425.11 <NA> what if they had patented pop up menus <unk> scrollbars the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 426.39 435.01 <NA> <unk> would a young and inexperienced apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like xerox now 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 435.54 442.57 <NA> this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you 're the one getting remixed 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 442.23 449.93 <NA> for example sj i mean picasso had a saying he said good artists copy <unk> great artists steal and

KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 470.17 479.94 <NA> now behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion we have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours we have no such aversion towards copying what other people
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 479.9 482.67 <NA> <unk> have because we do that nonstop 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 482.72 485.16 <NA> so here 's the sort of equation we 're looking at 
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 484.88 494.91 <NA> we 've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property <unk> plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases <unk> plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court <unk> plus cognitive <unk>
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 494.81 499.93 <NA> <unk> biases against perceived loss and the sum looks like this

KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 523.83 529.58 <NA> the song is a voyage through the past through a much darker time but a simpler one
KirbyFerguson_2012G 1 KirbyFerguson_2012G 530.23 534.14 <NA> <unk> time when musicians like willie mctell had few illusions about what they did
