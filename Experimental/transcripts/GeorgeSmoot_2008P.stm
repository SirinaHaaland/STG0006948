GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 21.4 25.05 <NA> to talk about the dawning of the universe and
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 25 35.25 <NA> what i call the cosmic scene investigation <unk> that is <unk> looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning <unk> and then following it up and trying to understand it and so <unk>
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 35.15 42 <NA> <unk> one of the questions that i asked you is when you look around what do you see <unk> well <unk> you see this space that 's created
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 50.88 57.88 <NA> <unk> and so the question is <unk> how did that material get here <unk> how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped and so forth
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 57.39 67.75 <NA> it 's a question of what 's the continuity so one of the things i look at is <unk> how did the universe begin and shape what was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to <unk>
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 67.65 79.79 <NA> <unk> getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials so that 's sort of the part <unk> and let me move on then and show you the hubble ultra deep field if you look at this picture <unk> what you will see is a lot of
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 79.78 81.96 <NA> <unk> dark with some light objects in it 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 81.96 90.32 <NA> and everything but four of these light objects are stars and you can see them there little pluses <unk> this is a star <unk> this is a star everything else is a galaxy 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 90.31 100.02 <NA> ok so there 's there 's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here and when i look out at particularly this galaxy which looks a lot like ours i wonder if
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 100.13 102.87 <NA> <unk> an art design college conference going on and
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 102.64 114.94 <NA> intelligent beings there are thinking about you know what designs they might do <unk> and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what 's going on over here <unk> 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 114.94 129.82 <NA> but there 's a lot of other galaxies and some are nearby and they 're kind of the color of the sun and some are further away and they 're a little bluer and so forth <unk> but one of the questions is this should be to you how come there are so many galaxies <unk> because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 129.99 138.7 <NA> <unk> is only one thousand galaxies <unk> we think there 's on the order visible to the hubble space telescope if you had the time to scan it around about one hundred billion galaxies right 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 138.39 141.1 <NA> it 's a very large number of galaxies
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 140.64 154.97 <NA> and that 's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy <unk> but when you look at some of these regions like this you 'll see more galaxies than stars which is kind of a conundrum <unk> so the question should come to your mind is what kind of design you know what kind
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 154.93 161.19 <NA> <unk> of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that <unk> and then i 'm going to show you it 's actually a lot more complicated <unk> 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 161.19 169.17 <NA> we 're going to try and follow it up we have a tool that actually helps us out in this study <unk> and that 's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big

GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 201.65 212.05 <NA> but if you look out to the nearest set of stars to the nearest forty or fifty stars <unk> it 's about ten years so if you take a picture of what 's going on it 's ten years ago <unk> but you go and look to the center <unk>
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 211.95 225.53 <NA> <unk> of the galaxy it 's thousands of years ago if you look at andromeda <unk> which is the nearest big galaxy and it 's two million years ago <unk> if you took a picture of the earth two million years ago there 'd be no evidence of humans at all because we don 't think there were humans yet i mean it just gives you the scale <unk>
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 229.89 239.57 <NA> but if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further there 's some things even further and that was what i did in a lot of my work was to develop the techniques

GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 617.45 629.7 <NA> plot of what it is <unk> and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right it 's called dark matter that is matter that doesn 't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does the way the light 's shining on me or on the
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 630.31 641.22 <NA> it 's transparent to light but in order for you to see it we 're going to make it white <unk> ok <unk> so the stuff that 's in this picture that 's white <unk> that is the dark matter it should be called invisible matter but the dark matter we 've made visible 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 641.22 650.49 <NA> and the stuff that is in the yellow color <unk> that is the ordinary kind of matter that 's turned into stars and galaxies so i 'll show you the next movie <unk> 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 651.65 654.79 <NA> so this we 're going to zoom in notice this pattern

GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 909.28 919.79 <NA> in the next picture so you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point now four times smaller and so forth <unk> and you start seeing these networks this cosmic web <unk>
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 919.74 925.11 <NA> of structure forming <unk> and this is a simple one because it doesn 't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 925.52 930.33 <NA> <unk> and you see how the dark matter lumps up and the ordinary matter just trails along behind
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 930.23 936.84 <NA> <unk> so there it is at the beginning it 's very uniform <unk> the fluctuations are a part in one hundred thousand there
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 936.41 939.33 <NA> are a few peaks that are a part in ten thousand <unk> 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 939.16 949.45 <NA> and then over billions of years <unk> gravity just pulls in this is light over density <unk> pulls the material around in that pulls in more material and pulls in more material
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 949.45 954.97 <NA> <unk> but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 955.02 965.83 <NA> <unk> for this to form <unk> and it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now in terms of its expansion and at that point the universe <unk>
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 965.78 975.01 <NA> mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger scale structure <unk> so we 're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see <unk> and then
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 975 984.75 <NA> <unk> only things that have started forming already are going to form and then from then on it 's going to go on <unk> so we 're able to do the simulation <unk> but this is two days
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 985.26 991.97 <NA> desktop <unk> we need you know <unk> thirty days on one thousand processors to do the the kind of simulation that i showed you before <unk> 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 991.97 996.5 <NA> so we have an idea of how to play
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 996.13 999.5 <NA> seriously creating the universe by starting with
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 999.16 1004.97 <NA> essentially less than an eyedrop full of material <unk> <unk> and we create everything we can see in any
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1004.9 1008.03 <NA> <unk> direction right from
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1008.68 1015.8 <NA> almost nothing that is <unk> something extremely tiny extremely small and
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1015.81 1016.81 <NA> it
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1016.8 1026.37 <NA> is almost perfect except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in one hundred thousand level <unk> which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see that is galaxies and
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1026.16 1029.73 <NA> and stars and so forth <unk> so we have a model
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1029.99 1035.42 <NA> <unk> can calculate it <unk> and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like <unk> 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1035.2 1040.8 <NA> and that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1040.8 1048.94 <NA> so this is what we started with fifteen years ago <unk> with the cosmic background explorer made the map on the upper right <unk> 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1048.75 1054.91 <NA> which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations and actually fluctuations on several scales
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1054.93 1063.18 <NA> <unk> you can kind of see that since then we 've had wmap which just gives us higher angular resolution we see the same large scale structure but we see additional small scale structure <unk> 
GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1 GeorgeSmoot_2008P 1063.19 1074.99 <NA> and on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the earth what kind of a map we would have got of the earth you can see well you can kind of pick out all the major continents but that 's about
