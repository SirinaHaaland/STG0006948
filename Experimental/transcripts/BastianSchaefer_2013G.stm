BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 12.67 19.58 <NA> <unk> we know about the future difficult question simple answer nothing we cannot predict the future
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 19.6 24.32 <NA> we only can create a vision of the future how it might be
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 24.32 30 <NA> a vision which reveals disruptive ideas which is inspiring and this is the most important reason
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 30.16 33.12 <NA> which breaks the chains of common thinking
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 32.66 37.72 <NA> there are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future for instance
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 37.72 48 <NA> this vision here from the early twenty th century it says here that this is the ocean plane of the future it takes only one and a half days to cross the atlantic ocean
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 47.57 54.28 <NA> today we know that this future vision didn 't come true so this is our largest airplane which we have the
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 54.98 63.07 <NA> hundred and eighty and it 's quite huge so a lot of people fit in there and it 's technically completely different than the vision i 've shown to you
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 62.76 69.82 <NA> i 'm working in a team with airbus and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of aviation
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 69.42 77.38 <NA> so sustainability is quite important for us which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 77.04 79.94 <NA> so we have created a very disruptive structure
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 79.96 85.22 <NA> <unk> which mimics the design of bone or a skeleton which occurs in nature
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 84.94 91.37 <NA> so that 's why it looks maybe a little bit weird especially to the people who deal with structures in general
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 90.91 98.48 <NA> but at least it 's just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 98.56 104.91 <NA> what are the main customers of the future so we have the old we have the young we have the uprising power of
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 104.87 111.94 <NA> <unk> women and there 's one mega trend which affects all of us these are the future anthropometrics
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 111.94 119.14 <NA> so our children are getting larger but at the same time we are growing into different directions so
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 118.91 121.98 <NA> what we need is space
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 122.12 129.94 <NA> inside the aircraft inside a very dense area these people have different needs so we see a clear need of active
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 130.04 136.63 <NA> health promotion especially in the case of the old people we want to be treated as individuals we
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 136.4 140.52 <NA> like to be productive throughout the entire travel
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 140.53 147.65 <NA> chain and what we are doing in the future is we want to use the latest man machine interface and
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 147.46 151.45 <NA> we want to integrate this and show this in one product
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 151.29 154.94 <NA> so we combined these needs with technology 's themes so
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 154.98 161.77 <NA> for instance we are asking ourselves how can we create more light how can we bring more natural light into the airplane
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 161.78 165.26 <NA> so this airplane has no windows anymore for example
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 164.86 174.66 <NA> what about the data and communication software which we need in the future my belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 174.66 180 <NA> it will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 179.99 187.84 <NA> <unk> complex technology this will be very different in the future it will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 187.6 199.81 <NA> and then we are talking also about materials synthetic biology for example and my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 199.81 204.21 <NA> because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 203.84 204.88 <NA> so let 's
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 204.84 213.31 <NA> <unk> compare the old world with the new world i just want to show you here what we are doing today so this is a bracket of an a three hundred and eighty crew rest compartment
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 213.24 222.16 <NA> it takes a lot of weight and it follows the classical design rules this here is an equal bracket for the same purpose
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 221.76 229.94 <NA> it follows the design of bone the design process is completely different at the one hand we have one point two kilos and at the other
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 229.9 241.17 <NA> <unk> hand zero point six kilos so this technology three d printing and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight which is the biggest issue in aircraft design because it 's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 241.17 250.17 <NA> push this idea a little bit forward so how does nature build its components and structures so nature is very clever it puts
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 250.13 257.19 <NA> <unk> all the information into these small building blocks which we call dna and nature builds large skeletons out of it
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 256.88 271.62 <NA> so we see a bottom up approach here because all the information as i said are inside the dna and this is combined with a top down approach because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles we train our skeleton and it 's getting stronger
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 271.62 274.96 <NA> and the same approach can be applied to technology as well so
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 275 282.67 <NA> <unk> our building block is carbon nanotubes for example to create a large rivet less skeleton at the end of the day
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 282.47 292.9 <NA> how this looks in particular you can show it here so imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing inside a three d printer and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic and follow <unk>
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 292.8 299.27 <NA> <unk> the forces which occur in your component and you 've got trillions of them so you really align them to wood
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 304.93 315.47 <NA> <unk> you to transmit electrical energy or data and now we take this material combine this with a top down approach and build bigger and bigger components
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 315.19 318.56 <NA> so how might the airplane of the future look
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 318.56 328.23 <NA> so we have very different seats which adapt to the shape of the future passenger with the different anthropometrics we have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 329.99 331.59 <NA> <unk> play virtual golf
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 331.4 342.72 <NA> and finally this bionic structure which is covered by a transparent biopolymer membrane will really change radically how we look at aircrafts in the future
BastianSchaefer_2013G 1 BastianSchaefer_2013G 342.26 348.58 <NA> so as jason silva said if we can imagine it why not make it so see you in the future thank you
