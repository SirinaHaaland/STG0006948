LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 14.11 19.37 <NA> <unk> by raising your hand how many of you know at least one person on the screen wow
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 19.81 25.05 <NA> it 's almost a full house it 's true <unk> they are very famous in their fields and
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 25 27.72 <NA> do you know what all of them have in common 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 27.38 30.55 <NA> they all died of pancreatic cancer <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 30.55 40.23 <NA> however although it 's very very sad this news it 's also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 39.77 49.02 <NA> it 's become the third cause of cancer deaths and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 49.01 54.1 <NA> that 's a very tiny number <unk> especially if you compare it with breast cancer
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 54.96 57.55 <NA> <unk> rate is almost ninety percent <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 57.42 65.9 <NA> so it doesn 't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death sentence 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 65.9 75.05 <NA> what 's shocking though is that in the last forty years <unk> this number hasn 't changed a bit while much more progress has been made with other types
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 76.48 80.6 <NA> <unk> so how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 80.17 92.9 <NA> as a biomedical entrepreneur i like to work on problems that seem impossible <unk> understanding their limitations and trying to find new innovative solutions that can change their outcome 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 92.56 101.82 <NA> the first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly <unk> literally it 's depicted in orange on the screen <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 101.82 104.94 <NA> but you can barely see it until i remove all
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 104.98 107.04 <NA> the other organs in front 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 106.58 113.08 <NA> it 's also surrounded by many other vital organs like the liver the stomach the bile duct 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 113.08 122.1 <NA> and the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs is the reason why pancreatic cancer is one of the most painful tumor types 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 121.82 124.93 <NA> the hard to reach location also prevents the
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 136.74 139.54 <NA> <unk> this brings us to the second piece of bad news 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 139.08 143.35 <NA> pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 143.12 147.22 <NA> why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 147.21 154.76 <NA> let 's think for a second how chemotherapy works the drug is injected in the vein and it navigates throughout the
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 155.16 161.82 <NA> until it reaches the tumor site it 's like driving on a highway <unk> trying to reach a destination <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 161.58 167.45 <NA> but what if your destination doesn 't have an exit on the highway you will never get there 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 167.44 172.85 <NA> and that 's exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 172.63 174.96 <NA> the drugs navigate throughout
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 175 177.13 <NA> <unk> all of your body <unk> they will reach
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 176.95 184.67 <NA> healthy organs resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall <unk> but very little will go to the tumor <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 184.68 187.44 <NA> therefore <unk> the efficacy is very limited 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 188 195.51 <NA> to me it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole body treatment to target a specific organ <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 195.51 204.85 <NA> however in the last forty years a lot of money <unk> research and effort have gone towards finding new powerful drugs to
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 205.05 211.3 <NA> <unk> pancreatic cancer <unk> but nothing has been done in changing the way we deliver them to the patient <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 211.89 217.03 <NA> so after two pieces of bad news <unk> i 'm going to give you good news <unk> hopefully 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 217.32 228.77 <NA> with a collaborator at mit and the massachusetts general hospital in boston <unk> we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer by making localized drug delivery a reality <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 228.77 229.97 <NA> we are basically
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 230.07 235.77 <NA> parachuting you on top of your destination <unk> avoiding your having to drive all around the highway <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 235.77 241.25 <NA> we have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 240.76 245.58 <NA> they are flexible enough that they can be
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 245.37 254.22 <NA> folded to fit into the catheter <unk> so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 254.87 269.52 <NA> <unk> they are solid enough that once they are positioned on top of the tumor they will act as a cage <unk> they will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs controlling the the metastasis the
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 269.93 275.14 <NA> devices are also biodegradable that means that once in the body <unk> they start
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 276.42 280.6 <NA> <unk> delivering the drug only locally slowly
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 280.17 285.14 <NA> and more effectively than what is done with the current whole body treatment 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 284.93 294.59 <NA> in pre clinical study we have demonstrated that this localized approach is able to improve by twelve times the response to treatment <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 294.59 304.97 <NA> so we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it 's needed the most we allow a response that is twelve times more powerful
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 305.01 308.18 <NA> <unk> reducing the systemic toxic effect <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 308.56 322.28 <NA> we are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level <unk> we are finalizing the pre clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking the fda for approval for clinical trials <unk> 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 322.45 329.94 <NA> currently the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer <unk> we are hoping that one day
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 329.96 338.16 <NA> <unk> we can reduce their pain extend their life and potentially make pancreatic cancer a curable disease 
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 337.76 349.53 <NA> by rethinking the way we deliver the drug we don 't only make it more powerful and less toxic <unk> we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions
LauraIndolfi_2016U 1 LauraIndolfi_2016U 349.13 356.53 <NA> for almost all other impossible problems in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond <unk> thank you very much
