AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 72.81 79.94 <NA> might be wondering how i came up with this idea of turning people into paintings <unk> but originally this had nothing
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 79.99 84.92 <NA> <unk> do with either people or paint it was about shadows
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 84.7 93.98 <NA> <unk> i was fascinated with the absence of light <unk> and i wanted to find a way that i could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 93.61 100.7 <NA> i came up with the idea of painting shadows <unk> i loved that i could hide within this shadow my own painted version <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 100.42 103.53 <NA> and it would be almost invisible
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 103.37 104.85 <NA> until the light changed
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 105.02 108.24 <NA> <unk> all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 108.53 111.69 <NA> i wanted to think about what else i could put shadows on <unk>

AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 113.75 122.28 <NA> but i didn 't just want to paint the shadows <unk> i also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 122.03 129.88 <NA> i had a very specific vision of what this would look like and as i was painting him <unk> i made sure to follow that very
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 129.81 139.33 <NA> <unk> closely <unk> but something kept on flickering before my eyes <unk> i wasn 't quite sure what i was looking at and then when i took that moment to take a step back <unk>

AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 140.88 149.93 <NA> i had turned my friend into a painting i couldn 't have foreseen that when i wanted to paint a shadow i would pull out this whole other
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 150.64 156.17 <NA> <unk> that i would collapse it that i would take a painting and make it my friend
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 156.13 158.72 <NA> and then bring him back to a painting 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 159.67 169.08 <NA> i was a little conflicted though <unk> because i was so excited about what i 'd found <unk> but i was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 169.08 171.9 <NA> and i 'd always had this dream

AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 180.86 186.9 <NA> <unk> why did this have to get in the way of all that i made the tough decision of
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 186.68 189.6 <NA> going home after graduation
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 189.29 194.34 <NA> and not going up to capitol hill <unk> but going down to my parents ' basement
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 194.14 197.64 <NA> and making it my job to learn how to paint <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 197.33 204.7 <NA> i had no idea where to begin the last time i 'd painted <unk> i was sixteen years old at summer camp
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 205.11 211.72 <NA> and i didn 't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 211.52 220.15 <NA> practicing over and over again on that surface <unk> because that 's not what this project was about for me it was about space and light 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 220.35 230 <NA> my early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn 't expect to be used as canvas like fried food <unk> it 's nearly impossible
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 229.48 234.08 <NA> <unk> impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 235.39 241.61 <NA> even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit <unk> it just
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 241.61 250.02 <NA> would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink i 'd put something down and instantly it would be gone <unk> and if i wanted to paint on
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 252.02 260.55 <NA> <unk> i was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that i spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 261.41 265.53 <NA> it just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 266.3 274.93 <NA> one of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn 't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 276.6 283.66 <NA> <unk> he also didn 't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition like the metro <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 285.54 289.42 <NA> i was having so much fun with this process
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 289.77 294.7 <NA> <unk> i was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles and
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 294.36 297.37 <NA> i wanted to see what else i could do with it 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 296.97 304.91 <NA> i came together with a collaborator sheila vand <unk> and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 304.93 307.07 <NA> <unk> and that was milk <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 307.54 313.28 <NA> we got a pool we filled it with milk <unk> we filled it with sheila <unk> and i began painting 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 313.03 317.81 <NA> and the images were always completely unexpected in the end <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 317.47 328.02 <NA> because i could have a very specific image about how it would turn out i could paint it to match that but the moment that sheila laid back into the milk everything would change 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 328.02 329.85 <NA> it was in constant flux
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 329.89 337.77 <NA> and we had to rather than fight it embrace it see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 338.51 344.59 <NA> sometimes <unk> when sheila would lay down in the milk <unk> it would wash all the paint off of her arms <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 344.59 349.87 <NA> and it might seem a little bit clumsy <unk> but our solution would be okay hide your
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 351.51 360.58 <NA> <unk> one time she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face all right well <unk> hide your face <unk> and
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 360.41 364.31 <NA> we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 364.31 372.28 <NA> even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can 't draw hands just hiding them in the pockets <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 373.05 375.05 <NA> when we started out on the milk
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 375.82 383.88 <NA> <unk> and when i started out i couldn 't have foreseen that i would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 383.64 385.97 <NA> to tripping over a shadow
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 385.74 392.01 <NA> and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk <unk> 
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 392.01 404.97 <NA> but then again i guess it 's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar as long as you 're willing to look beyond what 's already been brought to light that you can see what 's below the surface hiding in the shadows
AlexaMeade_2013G 1 AlexaMeade_2013G 404.66 411.28 <NA> <unk> shadows <unk> and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye <unk> thank you
