HallaTomasdottir_2016W 1 HallaTomasdottir_2016W 476.12 484.11 <NA> <unk> i ran as an independent candidate not with any political party or muscle behind me that lack of experience
HallaTomasdottir_2016W 1 HallaTomasdottir_2016W 483.62 489.36 <NA> and lack of access to resources probably came at a cost to our campaign <unk>

HallaTomasdottir_2016W 1 HallaTomasdottir_2016W 497.39 504.97 <NA> and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that it may be the reason why i had
HallaTomasdottir_2016W 1 HallaTomasdottir_2016W 504.96 509.83 <NA> <unk> less airtime on tv because i wanted to show other contenders respect 
HallaTomasdottir_2016W 1 HallaTomasdottir_2016W 510.15 523.15 <NA> when access to media proved to be so difficult <unk> we ran our own media <unk> i ran live facebook sessions where i took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot <unk>

HallaTomasdottir_2016W 1 HallaTomasdottir_2016W 565.13 575.05 <NA> am sad that it is that way but it 's true <unk> and we had less financial resources than the other candidates this probably
HallaTomasdottir_2016W 1 HallaTomasdottir_2016W 574.87 579.97 <NA> was partly due to the fact that i think i had a harder time asking for financial
HallaTomasdottir_2016W 1 HallaTomasdottir_2016W 579.99 589.9 <NA> <unk> support <unk> and maybe i also had the ambition to do more with less <unk> some would call that very womanly of me <unk>
