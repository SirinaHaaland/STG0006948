BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 545.5 554.97 <NA> to basically digitize ocr package it up make it so that you could download print and bind it the whole shebang we would have achieved something so we started out trying to figure out how do we
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 554.93 562.05 <NA> <unk> get to ten cents and we tried these robot things and they worked pretty well sort of these <unk> auto page turning things if we can have mars rovers

BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 570.73 573.43 <NA> ended up making our own book scanner
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 579.87 582.97 <NA> <unk> museum lighting so even if it 's a black and white book 
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 582.6 593.51 <NA> you can go and get the proper intonation <unk> so you basically do a beautiful respectful job this is not a fax this is the idea is to do a beautiful job
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 593.03 594.8 <NA> as you 're going through
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 594.8 604.58 <NA> these libraries <unk> and we 've been able to achieve ten cents a page if we run things in volume this is what it looks like at the university of toronto <unk> and actually it turns out to

BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 629.96 639.19 <NA> <unk> of congress if you did the whole darn thing twenty six million books is about seven hundred and fifty million dollars right but a million books i think actually would be
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 638.98 648.1 <NA> a pretty good start and that would cost thirty million dollars that 's not that big a bill and what we 've been able to do is get into libraries we 've now got
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 648.1 654.94 <NA> eight of these scanning centers in three countries and libraries are up for having their books scanned the getty here

BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 662.16 671.24 <NA> books which is fabulous so we 're starting to get the institutional responsibility the thing we 're missing is the ten cents if we can get the ten cents 
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 671.24 674.9 <NA> all the rest of it flows we 've scanned about two hundred thousand
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 675.4 682.49 <NA> <unk> now we 're scanning about fifteen thousand books a month and it 's starting to to gear up another factor of two
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 682.32 684.92 <NA> from there <unk> so all in all 
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 684.46 691.43 <NA> that 's going very well <unk> and we 're starting to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world <unk> 
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 690.94 698.93 <NA> so i think of we 're kind of going from the out of copyright library stuff and amazon com is coming from the in print
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 698.92 699.93 <NA> world <unk>
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 700.07 707.94 <NA> <unk> and i think we 'll meet in the middle some place and have the classic thing that you have which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 707.72 711.33 <NA> <unk> and so we 're starting up a program to do
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 711.11 718.77 <NA> out of print works but loaning them exactly what loaning means i 'm not quite sure <unk> but anyway loaning out of print works

BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 731.64 740.68 <NA> take over so all in all it 's possible to do this in large scale we 're also going back over microfilm and getting that
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 740.19 750.11 <NA> online so we can do ten cents a page we 're going fifteen thousand books a month and we 've got about two hundred and fifty thousand books online counting all the other projects that are starting to add
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 750.52 760.62 <NA> <unk> so what i wanted to argue is <unk> books are within our grasp the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal yes it costs
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 760.62 768.32 <NA> tens of millions <unk> low hundreds of millions <unk> but one time shot and we 've got basically the history of printed

BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 776.39 786.09 <NA> <unk> get it to people but it is within our grasp technologically and law wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest to be able to get
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 785.63 788.01 <NA> the whole darn thing
BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 787.58 789.21 <NA> online

BrewsterKahle_2007P 1 BrewsterKahle_2007P 804.78 810.55 <NA> <unk> published materials we 've been able to sort of point at it costs about ten dollars a piece to go and take a disk
