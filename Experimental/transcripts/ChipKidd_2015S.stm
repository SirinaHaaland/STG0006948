ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 114.77 116.2 <NA> so
ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 116.02 124.81 <NA> this is sort of symbolic about the decisions i have to make every day about the design that i 'm perceiving <unk>

ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 259.4 272.73 <NA> so i created this sort of abstract representation of this but there 's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story <unk> and there 's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket 
ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 272.48 275.11 <NA> the four fingers

ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 362.73 372.31 <NA> so usually i am creating a design that is in some way based on the text but this is all the text there is so you 've got this mysterious
ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 371.82 379.79 <NA> title that really doesn 't mean anything so i was trying to think where might i see a bit of mysterious

ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 416.75 423.12 <NA> but we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to mr sedaris 
ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 422.69 429.88 <NA> and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don 't even need the

ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 733.87 741.35 <NA> and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over

ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 789.44 797.22 <NA> <unk> but i also started thinking here 's our introduction right <unk> into the human digestive system
ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 797 804.37 <NA> but i think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths at least based on this
ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 807.75 811.9 <NA> so for the cover then i had this illustration done
ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 811.67 820.81 <NA> which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it 's best to approach the digestive system from this end 
ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 823.29 825.17 <NA> i don 't even have to complete

ChipKidd_2015S 1 ChipKidd_2015S 856.28 864.2 <NA> <unk> part of the problem here is that they 've compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful and frankly i don 't think it is at all
