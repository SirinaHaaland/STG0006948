UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 110.63 118.99 <NA> i mean <unk> it 's a hobby of mine that i 've been indulging in for the last few years and it all started out with this picture
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 118.78 122.67 <NA> of the american artist donald baechler i had hanging at home 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 122.33 129.49 <NA> i had to look at it every day and after a while i just couldn 't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long

UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 133.22 142.21 <NA> and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day <unk> so i decided to give him a little support 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 141.84 146.89 <NA> and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other

UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 163.54 167.78 <NA> world of modern art is particularly topsy turvy and
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 167.47 174.78 <NA> i can show here a very good example it 's actually a simple one but it 's a good one to start with it 's a picture by paul
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 175.82 180.45 <NA> <unk> and we can see here very clearly it 's a confusion of color <unk> 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 181.49 186.78 <NA> yeah the artist doesn 't really seem to know where to put the different colors
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 187.34 195.52 <NA> the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture the whole thing is unstructured we don 't know <unk> maybe <unk> mr klee was probably in a hurry

UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 217.14 225.2 <NA> <unk> we can see now what was barely recognizable in the original seventeen red and orange squares
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 233.77 240.2 <NA> <unk> i mean that 's just tidying up for beginners <unk> i would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced what

UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 250 252.84 <NA> been scattered aimlessly around the space
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 253.25 258.84 <NA> if my room back home had looked like this my mother would have grounded me for three days <unk> so
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 258.38 263.97 <NA> i 'd like to i wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture and
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 264.17 267.72 <NA> <unk> that 's really advanced tidying up yeah you
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 270.95 275.23 <NA> 're right sometimes people clap at this point but that 's actually more in switzerland

UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 290.36 293.53 <NA> a very good example to see this is a picture by
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 293.07 295.81 <NA> joan miro and
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 295.56 300.05 <NA> yeah <unk> we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 317.56 324.69 <NA> <unk> it 's more economical and also more efficient with this method <unk> mr miro could have saved canvas for another picture
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 325.73 329.88 <NA> <unk> but i can see in your faces that you 're still 're still a little bit skeptical <unk>
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 329.87 337.5 <NA> so that you can just appreciate how serious i am about all this i brought along the patents the specifications for some of these works <unk> 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 337.31 340.57 <NA> because i 've had my working methods patented at the
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 370.95 374.15 <NA> <unk> well i could have translated that but you would have been none the wiser <unk> 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 375 385.91 <NA> i 'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway <unk> i just realized it 's important how one introduces new ideas to people that 's why these patents are sometimes necessary 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 385.91 394.4 <NA> i would like to do a short test with you everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning so i would like to ask you all to raise your right hand <unk> 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 394.48 399.11 <NA> yeah <unk> the right hand is the one we write with apart from the left handers 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 398.68 404.97 <NA> and now i 'll count to three i mean it still looks very orderly to me now i 'll count to three and on
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 404.93 411.21 <NA> <unk> the count of three i 'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you <unk> ok <unk> one two three 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 418.76 424.9 <NA> you can see now that 's a good example even behaving in an orderly systematic way can sometimes
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 428.64 432.82 <NA> <unk> we can also see that very clearly in this next painting this is a painting
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 432.39 440.14 <NA> by the artist niki de saint phalle <unk> and i mean <unk> in the original it 's completely unclear to
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 439.8 449.96 <NA> see what this tangle of colors and and shapes is supposed to depict but in the tidied up version it 's plain to see that it 's a sunburnt woman
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 460 464.54 <NA> <unk> this one here that 's much better that 's a picture by by keith haring 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 467.89 469.79 <NA> i think it doesn 't matter
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 470.5 478.62 <NA> <unk> so i mean <unk> this picture has not even got a proper title <unk> it 's called untitled and i think that 's appropriate
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 480.56 486.3 <NA> <unk> so in the tidied up version we have a sort of keith haring spare parts shop 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 488.3 494.07 <NA> this is keith haring looked at statistically one can see here quite clearly <unk> you can
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 494.07 499.99 <NA> see we have twenty five pale green elements of which one is in the form of a circle
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 501.99 504.79 <NA> <unk> pink squares with only one pink curve <unk> 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 504.45 516.76 <NA> i mean <unk> that 's interesting one could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all <unk> mr haring 's various works in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares <unk> 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 516.42 525.05 <NA> and the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he 's likely to need
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 527.11 537.41 <NA> <unk> one can obviously also make combinations for example with the keith haring circles and kandinsky 's dots <unk> you can add them to all the squares of paul klee in the end one has a list <unk>
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 537.31 544.58 <NA> <unk> with which one then can arrange then you categorize it then you file it put that file in a filing cabinet put it in your office
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 546.37 548.46 <NA> and you can make a living doing it
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 557.15 566.31 <NA> <unk> here we have some artists that are a bit more structured it 's not too bad this is jasper johns we can see here he was practicing with his ruler 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 567.44 574.96 <NA> but i think it could still benefit from more discipline <unk> and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 583.02 588.46 <NA> <unk> that 's one of my favorites tidying up rene magritte this is really fun you know 
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 590.64 599.93 <NA> there is a i 'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this it goes back to a time when i was very often staying in hotels <unk> so once i had the opportunity to stay
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 603.43 612.76 <NA> <unk> had this little sign i put this little sign outside the door every morning that read please tidy room i don 't know if you have them over here <unk>

UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 696.04 704.85 <NA> some people would make apple pie out of it but it 's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that
UrsusWehrli_2006 1 UrsusWehrli_2006 704.78 708.09 <NA> <unk> involved the very <unk> time consuming job of
