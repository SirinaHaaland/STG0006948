AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 23.59 24.84 <NA> and i
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 25.73 32.4 <NA> <unk> what 's wrong with me i don 't understand why this keeps happening <unk> so i asked everybody in my life what they thought
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 31.97 34.9 <NA> i turned to my grandmother who always had
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 34.72 43.66 <NA> plenty of advice and she said stop being so picky you 've got to date around <unk> and most importantly true love will find you
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 43.66 50.17 <NA> when you least expect it now as it turns out <unk> i 'm somebody who thinks a lot about
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 53.04 57.22 <NA> <unk> i am constantly swimming in numbers formulas and charts
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 56.85 67.94 <NA> <unk> i also have a very tight knit family and i 'm very very close with my sister and as a result i wanted to have the same type of family when i grew up <unk> so i 'm at the end of this bad breakup i 'm thirty years old 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 67.94 69.17 <NA> i figure
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 69 71.87 <NA> i 'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 71.69 74.66 <NA> before i 'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 75.4 78.26 <NA> <unk> have to do that for a while before we can get engaged <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 78.26 85.61 <NA> and if i want to start having children by the time i 'm thirty five that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 85.72 94.73 <NA> so that wasn 't going to work if my strategy was to least expect my way into true love then the variable that i had to deal with was serendipity
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 94.24 99.87 <NA> <unk> in short i was trying to figure out what 's the probability of my finding mr right well 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 100.52 105.57 <NA> <unk> the time i was living in the city of philadelphia and it 's a big city <unk> and i figured
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 105.11 110.34 <NA> in this entire place there are lots of possibilities <unk> so again i started doing some math 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 110.21 112.5 <NA> population of philadelphia it
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 112.28 118.71 <NA> has one point five million people i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to seven hundred and fifty thousand i 'm
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 118.37 122.95 <NA> looking for a guy between the ages of thirty and thirty six which
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 122.76 129.16 <NA> was only four percent of the population so now i 'm dealing with the possibility of thirty thousand men i was looking for somebody who was jewish because
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 130.05 133.72 <NA> <unk> and that was important to me that 's only two point three percent of the population
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 133.47 142.3 <NA> i figure i 'm attracted to maybe one out of ten of those men and there was no way i was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 142.83 146.75 <NA> <unk> so that basically meant there were thirty five men for me that i could
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 146.59 148 <NA> possibly date
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 147.9 150.02 <NA> in the entire city of
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 152.35 155.73 <NA> <unk> in the meantime my very large jewish family
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 155.55 164.24 <NA> was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children and i felt like i was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 164.11 171.18 <NA> so i have two possible strategies at this point i 'm sort of figuring out one i can take my grandmother 's advice and sort of
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 172.21 174.93 <NA> <unk> my way into maybe bumping into the one
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 180.26 182.22 <NA> <unk> city of philadelphia or
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 181.94 184.07 <NA> i could try online dating 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 184.07 195.81 <NA> now i like the idea of online dating because it 's predicated on an algorithm <unk> and that 's really just a simple way of saying i 've got a problem i 'm going to use some data run it through a system and get to a solution 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 195.89 199.99 <NA> so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 200.16 203.99 <NA> <unk> but as it turns out algorithms have been around for thousands of years
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 203.99 215.2 <NA> in almost every culture <unk> in fact in judaism there were matchmakers a long time ago and though they didn 't have an explicit algorithm per se they definitely were running through formulas in their heads like 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 214.8 222.37 <NA> is the girl going to like the boy are the families going to get along what 's the rabbi going to say are they going to start having children right away
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 222 229.22 <NA> the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this put two people together and that would be the end of it <unk> so in my case i thought
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 229.81 231.47 <NA> <unk> well <unk> will data
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 231.3 234.44 <NA> and an algorithm lead me to my prince charming <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 234.13 240.48 <NA> so i decided to sign on now there was one small catch as i 'm signing on to the various dating websites 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 240.48 245.85 <NA> as it happens i was really really busy but that actually that actually wasn 't the biggest problem <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 245.64 249.77 <NA> the biggest problem is that i hate filling out questionnaires of any kind
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 249.61 254.97 <NA> and i certainly don 't like questionnaires that are like cosmo quizzes <unk> so i just copied
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 255.02 256.86 <NA> <unk> and pasted from my rsum 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 261.41 266.82 <NA> so in the descriptive part up top <unk> i said that i was an award winning journalist <unk>
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 266.77 273.45 <NA> and a future thinker when i was asked about fun activities and my ideal date i said monetization
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 279.81 285.73 <NA> <unk> obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 285.42 297.46 <NA> but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates what turned out to be truly
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 296.97 300.08 <NA> awful dates there was this guy
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 301.96 307.46 <NA> <unk> the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 307.29 311.3 <NA> and ' 80s music and so i agreed to go out with him <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 311.3 317.64 <NA> so steve the i t guy invited me out to one of philadelphia 's white table cloth extremely expensive restaurants 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 317.43 323.24 <NA> and we went in and right off the bat our conversation really wasn 't taking flight
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 322.9 328.95 <NA> but he was ordering a lot of food in fact he didn 't even bother looking at the menu he was ordering multiple appetizers multiple
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 329.93 336.12 <NA> <unk> me as well <unk> and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table also lots and lots of bottles of wine
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 335.96 344.52 <NA> <unk> so we 're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner and i 've decided steve the i t guy and i are really just not meant for each other but we 'll part ways as friends 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 344.42 346.95 <NA> when he gets up to go to the bathroom 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 346.97 349.99 <NA> and in the meantime <unk> the bill comes to
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 352.5 361.27 <NA> <unk> i 'm a modern woman i am totally down with with splitting the bill but then steve the i t guy didn 't come back and

AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 364.68 368.33 <NA> gasps so needless to say <unk> i was not having a good night <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 368.33 375.14 <NA> so i run home <unk> i call my mother <unk> i call my sister and as i do at the end of each one of these terrible
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 383.98 385.67 <NA> <unk> you 're just being too picky 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 385.75 392.07 <NA> so i said fine from here on out i 'm only going on dates where i know there 's wi fi and i 'm bringing my laptop i 'm
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 392.07 403.38 <NA> going to shove it into my bag <unk> i 'm going to have this email template <unk> and i 'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 404.9 406.5 <NA> <unk> started tracking things like
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 406.33 411.21 <NA> really stupid awkward sexual remarks bad vocabulary 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 411.02 414.72 <NA> the number of times a man forced me to high five him 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 416.21 425.11 <NA> so i started to crunch some numbers <unk> and that allowed me to make some correlations <unk> so as it turns out
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 426.63 432.4 <NA> <unk> some reason men who drink scotch reference kinky sex immediately well 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 434.04 443.56 <NA> it turns out that these probably weren 't bad guys there were just bad for me <unk> and as it happens the algorithms that were setting us up 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 443.1 449.18 <NA> they weren 't bad either these algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do <unk> which was to take our
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 455.13 464.75 <NA> see the real problem here is that while the algorithms work just fine you and i don 't when confronted with blank windows where we 're supposed to input our information online 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 464.75 470.18 <NA> very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 469.75 475.17 <NA> the other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like are you a dog person or a cat person
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 475.79 481.77 <NA> <unk> do you like horror films or romance films <unk> i 'm not looking for a pen pal i 'm looking for a husband right 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 482.15 492.9 <NA> so there 's a certain amount of superficiality in that data <unk> so i said fine <unk> i 've got a new plan i 'm going to keep using these online dating sites but i 'm going to treat them as databases 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 492.9 496.59 <NA> and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up i think i 'm going to try <unk>
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 497.51 504.85 <NA> <unk> this entire system <unk> so knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 504.9 513.31 <NA> <unk> decided instead to ask my own questions what was every single possible thing that i could think of that i was looking for in a mate <unk> so i started writing
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 513.33 514.99 <NA> and writing
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 514.59 516.1 <NA> and writing 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 516.03 526.7 <NA> and at the end i had amassed seventy two different data points <unk> i wanted somebody was jew ish so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 526.46 529.85 <NA> thoughts on our culture but wasn 't going to force me to go to shul every

AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 531.19 533.23 <NA> i wanted somebody who worked hard 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 533.24 541.31 <NA> because work for me is extremely important but not too hard for me <unk> the hobbies that i have are really just new work projects that i 've launched
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 541.21 552.06 <NA> <unk> i also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that i do <unk> so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 555.08 558.18 <NA> <unk> maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 557.87 564.12 <NA> so things like that but i also wanted somebody who would go to far flung exotic places like petra jordan <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 563.72 568.86 <NA> i also wanted somebody who would weigh twenty pounds more than me at all times regardless of what i weighed 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 570.77 574.78 <NA> so i now have these seventy two different data points <unk> which to be
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 576.36 583.66 <NA> <unk> so what i did was i went through and i prioritized that list i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 583.29 586.94 <NA> <unk> and i ranked everything starting at one hundred
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 586.61 589.06 <NA> and going all the way down to ninety one 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 588.69 597.52 <NA> and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart who would challenge and stimulate me <unk> and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 597.18 599.87 <NA> <unk> these things were also important to me but not
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 604.57 608.39 <NA> <unk> had all this done i then built a scoring system <unk> because
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 608.02 615.59 <NA> what i wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not i thought the guy that i found online would be a match with me 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 615.39 621.75 <NA> i figured there would be a minimum of seven hundred points before i would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 621.75 629.67 <NA> for nine hundred points i 'd agree to go out on a date <unk> and i wouldn 't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the one thousand five hundred point threshold
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 630.29 636.28 <NA> well as it turns out <unk> this worked pretty well <unk> so i go back online now i found
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 637.7 649.11 <NA> who 's incredibly good looking incredibly well spoken he had hiked mt fuji <unk> he had walked along the great wall he likes to travel as long as it doesn 't involve a cruise ship and i thought <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 650 655.51 <NA> done it i 've cracked the code i have just found the jewish prince charming

AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 663.45 672.25 <NA> and i guess the one variable that i haven 't considered is the competition who are all of the other women on these dating sites <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 679.99 685.79 <NA> <unk> as teacher she said she is silly nice and friendly she likes to make people laugh alot 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 685.39 693.5 <NA> at this moment i knew <unk> clicking profile after profile after profile that looked like this that i needed to do some market research <unk> so
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 693.04 699.26 <NA> i created ten fake male profiles now before i lose all of you 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 702.89 712.15 <NA> <unk> that i did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system <unk> i didn 't carry on crazy catfish style relationships with anybody <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 712.15 722.43 <NA> i really was just scraping their data <unk> but i didn 't want everybody 's data <unk> i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that i really really wanted to marry
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 722.39 729.94 <NA> when i released these men into the wild i did follow some rules <unk> so i didn 't reach out to any woman first
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 729.96 732.73 <NA> <unk> just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 732.56 742.87 <NA> and mainly what i was looking at was two different data sets so i was looking at qualitative data <unk> so what was the humor the tone <unk> the voice the communication style that these women shared in common <unk>
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 742.82 749.06 <NA> and also quantitative data <unk> so what was the average length of their profile how much time was spent between messages <unk> 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 756.1 758.88 <NA> <unk> i wanted to figure out how to maximize my own
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 758.64 763.56 <NA> profile online well one month later <unk> i had
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 763.56 775.08 <NA> a lot of data and i was able to do another analysis <unk> and as it turns out <unk> content matters a lot so smart people tend to write a lot three thousand four thousand five thousand words about
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 775.55 783.69 <NA> <unk> which may all be very very interesting the challenge here though is that the popular men and women are sticking to ninety seven words on average
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 783.5 788.22 <NA> that are written very very well <unk> even though it may not seem like it all the time
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 788.06 796.92 <NA> <unk> the other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they 're using non specific language <unk> so in my case the english patient is my most favorite movie ever
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 796.76 798.9 <NA> <unk> but
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 798.59 799.99 <NA> it doesn 't work
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 800 807.97 <NA> <unk> to use that in a profile because that 's a superficial data point and somebody may disagree and decide they don 't want to go out because they didn 't like sitting through the three hour movie 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 808.02 818.72 <NA> also optimistic language matters a lot so this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women words like fun and girl and love 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 818.72 824.78 <NA> and what i realized was not that i had to dumb down my own profile remember i 'm somebody who said that i speak fluent
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 825.22 831.56 <NA> <unk> and i know javascript and i was okay with that the difference is that it 's about being more approachable
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 831.33 835.04 <NA> and and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 835.04 843.21 <NA> and as it turns out timing is also really really important just because you have access to somebody 's mobile phone number or their instant message account
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 842.88 851.24 <NA> and it 's two o 'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake doesn 't mean that that 's a good time to to communicate with those people the popular women on on these online sites
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 851.24 854.94 <NA> spend an average of twenty three hours in between each communication
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 855.23 860.91 <NA> and that 's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship <unk> and finally
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 861.14 866.52 <NA> there were the photos all of the women who were popular showed some skin
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 866.09 873.18 <NA> they all looked really great <unk> which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had uploaded 
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 884.85 886.04 <NA> <unk> as it turns out
AmyWebb_2013S 1 AmyWebb_2013S 904.96 910.31 <NA> <unk> telling them about this fabulous news and they say this is wonderful how soon are you going out
