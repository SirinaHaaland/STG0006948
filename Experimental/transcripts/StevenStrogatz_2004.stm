StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 962.1 970.03 <NA> and within two days the bridge was closed to the public <unk> so i want to first show you some interviews
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 970.2 974.15 <NA> with people who were on the bridge on opening day who will describe what happened
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 987.73 991.71 <NA> <unk> could definitely there was something going on sideways it felt maybe
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1007.39 1009.36 <NA> <unk> at least six six to eight inches
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1045.59 1048.94 <NA> <unk> deliberately push your feet out sideways and
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1054.87 1064.69 <NA> <unk> probably the number of people on it interviewer were they deliberately walking in step <unk> or anything like that man no they just had to conform to the
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1064.26 1071.14 <NA> movement of the bridge steven strogatz all right so that already gives you a hint of what happened think of the bridge
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1070.89 1074.78 <NA> as being like this platform think of the people as being like
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1076.21 1080.42 <NA> <unk> you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome but after all we do
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1079.99 1088.51 <NA> walk like i mean we oscillate back and forth as we walk <unk> and especially if we start to walk like those people did right they all showed this strange
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1088.52 1101.51 <NA> sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move <unk> and so let me show you now the footage of the bridge <unk> but also after you see the bridge on opening day you 'll see an interesting clip of work done by
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1101.74 1104.73 <NA> a bridge engineer at cambridge named allan mcrobie
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1105.28 1115.8 <NA> who figured out what happened on the bridge and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was it was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked <unk>
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1115.75 1121.81 <NA> and the way the bridge began to move that engineers knew nothing about actually i think the first person you 'll see is the
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1135.63 1143.08 <NA> <unk> i felt i was disappointed about it <unk> we 'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge <unk> and we 'd analyzed it <unk> we 'd
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1142.68 1147.98 <NA> checked it to codes to heavier loads than the codes and here it was doing something that
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1154.84 1164.57 <NA> <unk> people apparently rocking from side to side in unison not only with each other <unk> but with the bridge <unk> this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge <unk> 
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1165.1 1174.48 <NA> but how could the crowd become synchronized was there something special about the millennium bridge that caused this effect this was to be the focus of the investigation
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1189.35 1198.15 <NA> <unk> you reckon mimics the action of the real bridge am it captures a lot of the physics yes interviewer right so if we get on it we should be able to wobble it yes <unk> 
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1199.58 1204.79 <NA> allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me suggesting that a bridge simulator
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1205.05 1213.85 <NA> <unk> to wobble in the same way as the real bridge provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length am this one 's only a couple of tons so it 's fairly easy to get going
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1213.85 1218.92 <NA> just by walking interviewer well it 's certainly going now am it doesn 't have to be a real dangle just walk it starts to go interviewer it
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1218.82 1221.41 <NA> 's actually quite difficult to walk 
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1221.43 1225.11 <NA> you have to be careful where you put your feet down don 't you because
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1224.88 1229.55 <NA> if you get it wrong it just throws you off your feet am it certainly affects the way you walk
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1230.86 1232.34 <NA> normally on it interviewer
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1232.36 1239.99 <NA> no if you try and put one foot in front of another it 's moving your feet away from under you am yes interviewer so you 've got to put your feet out sideways <unk> 
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1240.19 1245.94 <NA> so already the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1255.43 1258.54 <NA> just walk normally <unk> 
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1265.52 1267.76 <NA> it 's really intriguing because
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1267.52 1272.7 <NA> none of these people is trying to drive it <unk> they 're all having some difficulty walking <unk> 
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1272.3 1278.56 <NA> and the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step <unk> but then of course everyone is driving the bridge
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1280.65 1287.44 <NA> <unk> you can 't help it you 're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step <unk> and therefore to drive it to move further ss 
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1291.72 1294.35 <NA> all right well with that from the
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1294.14 1297.4 <NA> ministry of silly walks maybe i 'd better end <unk> 
StevenStrogatz_2004 1 StevenStrogatz_2004 1297.18 1305.33 <NA> i see i 've gone over but i hope that you 'll go outside and see the the world in a new way to see all the amazing synchrony around us thank you
