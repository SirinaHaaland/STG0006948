AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 143.79 150.11 <NA> there 's been a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees and i am no exception
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 152.11 153.77 <NA> <unk> was the launch pad
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 153.37 156.59 <NA> to the next decade of my life 's exploration 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 156.94 167.36 <NA> at the time <unk> the legs i presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics i had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah which you may have seen on stage yesterday <unk> 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 166.96 168.53 <NA> and
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 168.07 175.02 <NA> also these very life like intrinsically painted silicone legs so at the time
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 175 181.92 <NA> was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 181.55 185.8 <NA> to come bring their talent to the science and to the art
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 185.59 195.03 <NA> of building legs so that we can stop compartmentalizing form <unk> function and aesthetic and assigning them different values well 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 194.81 198.9 <NA> lucky for me a lot of people answered that call <unk> 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 199.4 201.97 <NA> and the journey started funny enough with
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 201.78 204.82 <NA> a ted conference attendee chee pearlman who
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 204.81 210.04 <NA> <unk> hopefully is in the audience somewhere today she was the editor then of a magazine called id <unk> 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 209.85 213.13 <NA> and she gave me a cover story 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 212.67 220.7 <NA> this started an incredible journey curious encounters were happening to me at the time i 'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 220.52 223.9 <NA> on the design of the cheetah legs around the world and
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 223.8 229.79 <NA> people would come up to me after the conference after my talk men and women <unk> and the conversation would go
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 229.99 236.36 <NA> <unk> like this you know aimee <unk> you 're very attractive you don 't look disabled 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 237.43 245.02 <NA> i thought well that 's amazing because i don 't feel disabled and it really opened my eyes to
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 245.02 249.99 <NA> this conversation that could be explored about beauty what does a beautiful woman have
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 251.51 253.05 <NA> <unk> a sexy body and
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 252.88 257.94 <NA> interestingly from an identity standpoint what does it mean to have a disability <unk> 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 257.69 263.13 <NA> i mean people pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do <unk> nobody calls her disabled 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 269.87 279.7 <NA> so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer peter saville went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen and photographer nick knight who were also interested in exploring that
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 279.66 289.6 <NA> <unk> conversation so three months after ted i found myself on a plane to london doing my first fashion shoot <unk> which resulted in this cover <unk>
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 292.32 297.31 <NA> three months after that i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 297.3 304.97 <NA> on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash <unk> nobody knew everyone thought they were wooden boots actually i have them
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 304.96 314.28 <NA> <unk> on stage with me <unk> grapevines <unk> magnolias truly stunning <unk> poetry
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 314.04 318.93 <NA> matters <unk> poetry is what elevates the banal
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 318.93 324.38 <NA> and neglected object to a realm of art it can transform
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 323.98 325.08 <NA> the thing that
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 325.01 326.13 <NA> <unk> might have
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 326.45 328.53 <NA> made people fearful
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 328.37 335.19 <NA> into something that invites them to look and look a little longer <unk> and maybe even understand <unk> 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 335.51 344.22 <NA> i learned this firsthand with my next adventure the artist matthew barney in his film opus called the the cremaster cycle 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 344.21 354.04 <NA> this is where it really hit home for me that my legs could be wearable sculpture and even at this point <unk> i started to move away from the need to replicate
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 355.07 362.29 <NA> as the only aesthetic ideal <unk> so we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they 're
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 361.92 370.42 <NA> actually optically clear polyurethane a k a bowling ball material heavy then we made these legs that are cast in soil
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 370.41 374.99 <NA> with a potato root system growing in them and beetroots out the top and a very lovely brass
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 380.02 381.45 <NA> <unk> little homage to my
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 381.21 390.57 <NA> life as an athlete fourteen hours of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that had articulated paws <unk> claws
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 390.57 395.21 <NA> and a tail that whipped around like a gecko 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 396.64 404.97 <NA> and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these look like jellyfish legs also polyurethane
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 405.07 410.76 <NA> <unk> and the only purpose that these legs can serve outside the context of the film is
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 410.42 417.09 <NA> to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination so whimsy
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 416.63 425.08 <NA> matters <unk> today <unk> i have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 425.28 427.57 <NA> <unk> and with them i have different negotiations
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 427.4 436.75 <NA> of the terrain under my feet and i can change my height i have a variable of five different heights today i 'm six ' one 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 437.04 446.65 <NA> and i had these legs made a little over a year ago at dorset orthopedic in england and when i brought them home to manhattan my first night out on the town i went to a very fancy party 
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 446.65 449.87 <NA> and a girl was there who has known me for years at my
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 458.89 466.64 <NA> <unk> a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts but i have an entirely new relationship to door jams that i never expected i would ever have <unk> and

AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 479.96 485.68 <NA> <unk> really meant it it 's not fair that you can change your height as you want it
AimeeMullins_2009U 1 AimeeMullins_2009U 507.6 508.76 <NA> <unk> the need to replicate
