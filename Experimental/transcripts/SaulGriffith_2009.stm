SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 16.27 25.55 <NA> <unk> if you 're at all like me this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in san francisco <unk> you build experimental kite powered hydrofoils capable of more than thirty knots
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 25.21 29.97 <NA> <unk> and you realize that there is incredible power in the wind <unk> and it can do amazing things
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 30.11 34.35 <NA> <unk> and one day a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 34.01 43.74 <NA> but kites aren 't just toys like this kites i 'm going to give you a brief history and tell you about the magnificent future of every child 's favorite plaything <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 43.49 49.84 <NA> so kites are more than a thousand years old and the chinese used them for military applications and even for
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 50.46 55.93 <NA> <unk> so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights i 'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 56.97 68.08 <NA> in one thousand eight hundred and twenty seven a fellow called george pocock actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the english countryside <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 67.65 79.73 <NA> then of course at the dawn of aviation <unk> all of the great inventors of the time like hargreaves like langley even alexander graham bell inventor of the telephone who was flying this kite were doing so in the pursuit of aviation
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 79.87 82.28 <NA> then these two fellows came along <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 82.27 93.24 <NA> and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight <unk> so this is of course orville and wilbur wright <unk> and the wright flyer <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 93.01 98.66 <NA> and their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion where we powered up and took off for the <unk>
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 102.62 114.46 <NA> <unk> and that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation <unk> but unfortunately it relegated kites once again to be considered children 's toys that was until the 1970s where we had the last energy crisis <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 114.46 128.73 <NA> and a fabulous man called miles loyd who lives on the outskirts of san francisco <unk> wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the journal of energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 128.36 129.97 <NA> the real key observation
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 130.11 138.79 <NA> <unk> he made is that a free flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a <unk> fixed wing turbine <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 138.78 150.25 <NA> so turbines grew and they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height <unk> but they can 't really go a lot higher <unk> and more height is where the more wind is and more power as much as twice as much 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 149.76 154.97 <NA> so cut to now we still have an energy crisis and now we have a climate crisis as well
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 154.72 155.75 <NA> <unk> well you
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 155.77 161.22 <NA> know so humans generate about twelve trillion watts or twelve terawatts from fossil fuels <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 161.22 165.45 <NA> and al gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 165.26 170.67 <NA> and in reality what that means is in the next thirty to forty years we have to make ten
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 170.51 179.22 <NA> trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow wind is the second largest renewable resource after solar
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 179.93 191.07 <NA> <unk> terawatts more than enough to supply humanity two hundred times over the majority of it is in the higher altitudes above three hundred feet where we don 't have a technology as yet to get there <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 190.79 202.53 <NA> so this is the dawn of the new age of kites this is our test site on maui flying across the sky i 'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 202.04 204.73 <NA> by every child 's favorite plaything
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 205.05 210.7 <NA> <unk> as you can tell you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours it makes you a little nauseous <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 210.47 219.41 <NA> and here we 're actually generating about ten kilowatts so enough to power probably five united states households with a kite not much larger than this piano <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 219.41 224.96 <NA> and the real significant thing here is we 're developing the control systems as did the wright brothers that
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 228.7 232.1 <NA> <unk> it doesn 't hurt to do it in a location like this either <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 232.6 238.16 <NA> so this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow that 's tracing your name in the sky 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 237.79 246.27 <NA> and this is where we 're actually going so we 're beyond the 12 second steps <unk> and we 're working towards megawatt scale machines that fly at two thousand feet
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 246.08 250.29 <NA> and generate tons of clean electricity <unk> so you ask how big are those machines
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 250.64 253.44 <NA> <unk> this paper plane would be maybe a
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 253.24 258.93 <NA> oop that would be enough to power your cell phone your cessna would be two hundred and thirty killowatts 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 258.93 263.52 <NA> if you 'd loan me your gulfstream i 'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt if
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 263.12 272.1 <NA> you give me a seven hundred and forty seven i 'll make six megawatts which is more than the largest wind turbines today <unk> and the spruce goose would be a 15 megawatt wing <unk> 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 271.79 279.97 <NA> so that is audacious you say <unk> i agree <unk> but audacious is what has happened many times before in history <unk> this is a refrigerator factory
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 279.66 289.08 <NA> <unk> factory <unk> churning out airplanes for world war ii prior to world war ii they were making one thousand planes a year by one thousand nine hundred and forty five they were making one hundred thousand 
SaulGriffith_2009 1 SaulGriffith_2009 289.08 294.44 <NA> with this factory and one hundred thousand planes a year we could make all of america 's electricity in about ten years
