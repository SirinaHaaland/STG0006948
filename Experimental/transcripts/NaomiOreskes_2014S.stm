NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 54.72 56.02 <NA> <unk> science well
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 55.8 65.32 <NA> scientists don 't like talking about science as a matter of belief in fact they would contrast science with faith and they would say belief is the domain of faith <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 64.92 72.29 <NA> and faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science <unk> indeed they would say religion is based on faith
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 72.1 75.11 <NA> or maybe the calculus of pascal 's wager
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 76.18 85.56 <NA> <unk> blaise pascal was a 17th century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in god <unk> and his wager went like this 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 85.56 90.54 <NA> well <unk> if god doesn 't exist but i decide to believe in him
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 90.32 100.05 <NA> nothing much is really lost <unk> maybe a few hours on sunday but if he does exist and i don 't believe in him then i 'm in deep trouble <unk>
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 100.43 112.92 <NA> <unk> and so pascal said we 'd better believe in god or as one of my college professors said he clutched for the handrail of faith he made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 113.72 120.01 <NA> <unk> now the fact is though for most of us most scientific claims are a leap of faith <unk>

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 154.99 158.72 <NA> <unk> 's claims <unk> and should we believe those claims <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 159.01 164.93 <NA> so what i 'd like to argue is yes we should but not for the reason that most of us think 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 164.47 173.55 <NA> most of us were taught in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method <unk> we were taught that scientists follow a method
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 173.38 179.94 <NA> and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims the method that most of us were
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 179.9 190.74 <NA> <unk> taught in school we can call it the textbook method is the hypothetical deductive method <unk> according to the standard model the textbook model scientists develop hypotheses <unk>
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 190.69 204.25 <NA> <unk> they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses <unk> and then they go out into the world and they say okay <unk> well are those consequences true can we observe them taking place in the natural world and if they are true then the scientists say
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 204.96 207.4 <NA> <unk> know the hypothesis is correct 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 206.91 216.37 <NA> so there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this one of the most famous examples comes from the work of albert einstein 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 216.36 225.05 <NA> when einstein developed the theory of general relativity one of the consequences of his theory was that space time wasn 't just an empty void but that it actually had
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 226.18 230.84 <NA> <unk> and that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 230.44 237.5 <NA> so if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 237.27 251.13 <NA> that was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to test it but they did test it in one thousand nine hundred and nineteen nineteen and lo and behold it turned out to be true <unk> starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 251.13 254.94 <NA> this was a huge confirmation of the theory it was considered proof
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 254.9 264.66 <NA> <unk> of the truth of this radical new idea <unk> and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe now sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the <unk>

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 276.99 283.76 <NA> <unk> having to do with laws <unk> and in the ideal case the hypothesis isn 't just an idea <unk> ideally it is a law of nature <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 283.55 293.98 <NA> why does it matter that it is a law of nature <unk> because if it is a law <unk> it can 't be broken if it 's a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances <unk>
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 293.88 299.75 <NA> <unk> are and all of you know of at least one example of a famous law einstein 's famous equation
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 304.87 309.14 <NA> <unk> mass <unk> and that relationship is true no matter what 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 308.86 315.8 <NA> now <unk> it turns out though that there are several problems with this model <unk> the main problem is that it 's wrong it 's just
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 319.87 324.87 <NA> and i 'm going to talk about three reasons why it 's wrong <unk> so the first reason is a logical
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 325.76 339.78 <NA> <unk> it 's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent <unk> so that 's another fancy academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions <unk> so just because the prediction comes true doesn 't actually logically prove that the theory is correct <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 339.55 343.72 <NA> and i have a good example of that too again from the history of science 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 343.72 349.78 <NA> this is a picture of the ptolemaic universe with the earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 351.06 356.5 <NA> <unk> the ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 356.3 357.86 <NA> well <unk> why 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 357.68 368.23 <NA> well the answer is because it made lots of predictions that came true <unk> the ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet in fact more accurate predictions <unk>
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 368.13 373.15 <NA> <unk> at first than the copernican theory which we we now would say is true <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 379.87 381.5 <NA> <unk> hypotheses <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 381.1 389.48 <NA> auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that they 're making 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 389.08 397.04 <NA> so an important example of this comes from the copernican model <unk> which ultimately replaced the ptolemaic system <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 396.73 399.96 <NA> so when nicolaus copernicus said actually the
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 400.25 407.11 <NA> <unk> not the center of the universe the sun is the center of the solar system the earth moves around the sun scientists said well
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 406.87 416.79 <NA> okay nicolaus <unk> if that 's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the earth around the sun and so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallax 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 416.79 420.66 <NA> and astronomers said <unk> if the earth is moving
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 420.17 425.08 <NA> and we look at a prominent star let 's say sirius well i know i 'm in manhattan so you guys
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 425.22 429.64 <NA> <unk> see the stars but imagine you 're out in the country <unk> imagine you chose that rural life
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 429.39 435.58 <NA> and we look at a star in december we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 435.12 446.17 <NA> if we now make the same observation six months later when the earth has moved to this position in june we look at that same star and we see it against a different backdrop 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 445.71 450.2 <NA> that difference that angular difference is the stellar parallax
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 450.37 457.4 <NA> <unk> so this is a prediction that the copernican model makes astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 457.12 458.69 <NA> nothing 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 458.77 460.68 <NA> nothing at all <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 460.44 466.14 <NA> and many people argued that this proved that the copernican model was false <unk> so what happened 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 466.14 474.78 <NA> well in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses <unk> both of which we would now say were incorrect the first was an
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 475.19 477.63 <NA> <unk> about the size of the earth 's orbit 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 477.14 483.03 <NA> astronomers were assuming that the earth 's orbit was large relative to the distance to the stars <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 483.03 492.46 <NA> today we would draw the picture more like this this comes from nasa <unk> and you see the earth 's orbit is actually quite small in fact it 's actually much smaller even than shown here 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 492.22 497.4 <NA> the stellar parallax therefore is very small and actually very hard to detect <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 497.09 499.84 <NA> and that leads to the second reason why the
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 501.09 510.11 <NA> <unk> because scientists were also assuming that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallax and that turned out not to be true <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 510.11 516.11 <NA> it wasn 't until the 19th century that scientists were able to detect the stellar parallax <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 515.87 524.11 <NA> so there 's a third problem as well <unk> the third problem is simply a factual problem that a lot of science doesn 't fit the textbook model 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 523.65 529.91 <NA> a lot of science isn 't deductive at all <unk> it 's actually inductive and by that we mean that scientists
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 529.96 537.26 <NA> <unk> 't necessarily start with theories and hypotheses often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 536.89 542.6 <NA> and the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived charles darwin 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 542.23 545.88 <NA> when darwin went out as a young man on the voyage of the beagle 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 545.88 553.02 <NA> he didn 't have a hypothesis he didn 't have a theory he just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 552.78 554.67 <NA> and he started to collect data
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 555.02 557.04 <NA> <unk> he knew that he hated medicine
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 556.94 561.34 <NA> because the sight of blood made him sick so he had to have an alternative career path 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 561.13 563.56 <NA> so he started collecting data 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 563.56 571.38 <NA> and he collected many things including his famous finches when he collected these finches he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 570.92 576.97 <NA> many years later back in london darwin looked at his data again and began to develop
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 576.78 579.91 <NA> an explanation and that explanation was the theory of
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 579.87 581.47 <NA> <unk> natural selection <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 581.16 586.34 <NA> besides inductive science <unk> scientists also often participate in modeling 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 586.1 592.72 <NA> one of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things <unk> and how do we do that 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 592.71 600.08 <NA> well one way you can do it is to build a model that tests an idea <unk> so this is a picture of henry cadell who was a scottish geologist
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 601.45 605.63 <NA> <unk> you can tell he 's scottish because he 's wearing a deerstalker cap and wellington boots 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 606.85 617.86 <NA> and cadell wanted to answer the question how are mountains formed <unk> and one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains like the appalachians you often find that the rocks in them are folded <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 617.7 623.93 <NA> and they 're folded in a particular way which suggested to him that they were actually being compressed from the side <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 623.93 628.47 <NA> and this idea would later play a major role in discussions of continental drift <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 628.24 629.94 <NA> so he built this model this
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 629.87 635.25 <NA> <unk> crazy contraption with levers and wood and here 's his wheelbarrow buckets a big sledgehammer 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 634.91 640.26 <NA> i don 't know why he 's got the wellington boots maybe it 's going to rain <unk> and he
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 639.77 645.78 <NA> created this physical model in order to demonstrate that you could in fact create
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 645.86 654.97 <NA> patterns in rocks or at least in this case in mud that looked a lot like mountains if you compressed them from the side so it was an argument about the cause of
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 654.96 656.38 <NA> <unk> mountains 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 655.98 666.28 <NA> nowadays most scientists prefer to work inside so they don 't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations <unk> but a computer simulation is a kind of a <unk>
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 666.18 675.28 <NA> <unk> model it 's a model that 's made with mathematics and like the physical models of the 19th century <unk> it 's very important for thinking about causes 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 679.93 682.28 <NA> <unk> evidence that the earth is warming warming up 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 682.28 692.07 <NA> this slide here <unk> the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last one hundred and fifty years showing that the earth 's temperature has steadily increased 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 691.84 699.78 <NA> and you can see in particular that in the last fifty years there 's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade or almost two degrees
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 701.03 707.52 <NA> <unk> so what though is driving that change how can we know what 's causing the observed warming 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 707.52 711.48 <NA> well scientists can model it using a computer simulation <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 711.02 718.9 <NA> so this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the earth 's climate 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 718.9 722.16 <NA> so sulfate particles from air pollution 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 721.79 729.88 <NA> volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions changes in solar radiation and of course greenhouse gases <unk> and they
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 729.81 734.77 <NA> <unk> asked the question what set of variables put into a model
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 734.57 743.86 <NA> will reproduce what we actually see in real life so here is the real life in black here 's the model in this light gray and the answer is

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 750.46 760.97 <NA> <unk> the only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together including greenhouse gases and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse <unk>
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 760.87 774.99 <NA> <unk> gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last fifty years and so this is why climate scientists say it 's not just that we know that climate change is happening we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 777.02 784.38 <NA> <unk> so now because there all these different things that scientists do the philosopher paul feyerabend famously said 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 783.98 789.93 <NA> the only principle in science that doesn 't inhibit progress is anything goes 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 789.56 796.49 <NA> now this quotation has often been taken out of context because feyerabend was not actually saying that in science anything goes <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 796.49 804.94 <NA> what he was saying was actually the full quotation is if you press me to say what is the method of science i would have to say
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 804.72 812.92 <NA> <unk> say <unk> anything goes what he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things scientists are creative <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 812.97 818.78 <NA> but then this pushes the question back if scientists don 't use a single method 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 818.54 823.9 <NA> then how do they decide what 's right and what 's wrong <unk> and who judges <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 823.9 829.79 <NA> and the answer is scientists judge and they judge by judging evidence scientists
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 830.08 836.99 <NA> <unk> evidence in many different ways <unk> but however they collect it they have to subject it to scrutiny <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 836.56 848.12 <NA> and this led the sociologist robert merton to focus on this question of how scientists scrutinize data and evidence and he said they do it in a way he called organized skepticism 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 847.75 854.97 <NA> and by that he meant it 's organized because they do it collectively they do it as a group <unk> and skepticism because they do
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 854.93 861.66 <NA> <unk> it from a position of distrust that is to say the burden of proof is on the person with a novel claim <unk>

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 870.68 879.97 <NA> so despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts what we find is that actually really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 882.57 886.18 <NA> so finally that brings us to one more idea <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 886.26 894.29 <NA> if scientists judge evidence collectively <unk> this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 894.29 904.88 <NA> and to say that at the end of the day what science is what scientific knowledge is is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 904.78 913.37 <NA> <unk> scrutiny collective scrutiny <unk> have judged the evidence and come to a conclusion about it either yea or nay <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 913.69 921.03 <NA> so we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts we can also think of science as being a kind of a jury <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 921.03 925.02 <NA> except it 's a very special kind of jury <unk> it 's not a jury of your

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 936.23 944.01 <NA> or not guilty the scientific jury actually has a number of choices <unk> scientists can say yes something 's true <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 943.73 950.05 <NA> scientists can say no it 's false <unk> or they can say <unk> well it might be true but we need to
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 950 959.14 <NA> work more and collect more evidence or they can say it might be true but we don 't know how to answer the question and we 're going to put it aside and maybe we 'll come back to it later 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 959.43 963.28 <NA> that 's what scientists call intractable 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 963.45 966.58 <NA> but this leads us to one final problem
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 966.24 971.89 <NA> <unk> if science is what scientists say it is then isn 't that just an appeal to authority <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 971.89 976.21 <NA> and weren 't we all taught in school that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy <unk> 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 975.93 979.1 <NA> well here 's the paradox of modern science

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 1007.54 1014.48 <NA> science does appeal to authority <unk> but it 's not based on any individual no matter how smart that individual may be

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 1033.38 1037.14 <NA> course these people don 't really look like scientists because they 're much too happy

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 1045.17 1049.99 <NA> most of us get up in the morning most of us trust our cars

NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 1067.3 1073.09 <NA> it 's not because of the genius of henry ford or karl benz or even elon musk 
NaomiOreskes_2014S 1 NaomiOreskes_2014S 1072.63 1079.25 <NA> it 's because the modern automobile is the product of more than one hundred years of work
