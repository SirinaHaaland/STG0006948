EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 41.06 49.99 <NA> if you 've gone onto twitter in the last couple of weeks you 've probably seen this <unk> it 's been a major trending topic <unk> being a monolingual american i obviously don 't know what the phrase
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 50.64 58.83 <NA> <unk> i went onto twitter and i asked some people if they could explain to me cala a boca galvao and fortunately my brazilian friends were more than ready to help <unk> 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 58.84 67.73 <NA> they explained that the galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that 's in terrible terrible danger in fact i 'll let them tell you a bit more about
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 79.96 84.14 <NA> <unk> actually gets worse it turns out that not only is the galvao parrot
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 83.97 94.46 <NA> very attractive <unk> useful for headdresses it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties which means that there 's a terrible problem with galvao abuse some <unk>
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 94.36 104.97 <NA> <unk> sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting galvao and it 's terribly endangered the good news about this is that the global community again my brazilian friends tell me is pitching in to help out
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 104.96 115.23 <NA> <unk> it turns out that lady gaga has released a new single actually five or six new singles as near as i can tell titled cala a boca galvao and my brazilian friends tell <unk>

EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 129.9 137.38 <NA> <unk> actually means something very different in portugese it means shut your mouth galvao and it specifically refers to this guy galvao bueno 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 137.21 147.46 <NA> who 's the lead soccer commentator for rede globo and what i understand from my brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine he can ruin the most <unk>
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 147.41 154.88 <NA> interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again <unk> so brazilians went to that first match against north korea
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 155.08 166.58 <NA> <unk> up this banner started a twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase cala a boca galvao and in fact were so successful at this that it topped twitter for two weeks now
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 166.42 168.33 <NA> there 's a couple
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 168.09 173.51 <NA> there 's a couple of lessons that you can take from this and the first lesson which i think is a worthwhile one 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 173.51 179.73 <NA> is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online <unk> so long as activism just means
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 179.72 190.51 <NA> <unk> retweeting a phrase <unk> so as long as activism is that simple it 's pretty easy to get away with the other thing you can take from this by the way is that there are a lot of brazilians on twitter <unk> 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 190.51 204.43 <NA> there 's more than five million of them as far as national representation <unk> eleven percent of brazilian internet users are on twitter that 's a much higher number than in the u s or u k next to japan it 's the second most represented by population
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 204.87 210.95 <NA> <unk> now if you 're using twitter or other social networks <unk> and you didn 't realize this was a space with a lot of brazilians in it you
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 210.77 218.66 <NA> 're like most of us because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 218.66 224.99 <NA> and if you are like me a big geeky white american guy <unk> you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky white american guys
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 225 233.39 <NA> <unk> and you don 't necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very heavily brazilian space <unk> it 's also extremely surprising to many americans a heavily <unk>
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 234.31 246.65 <NA> <unk> space twitter recently did some research they looked at their local population they believe that twenty four percent of american twitter users are african american that 's about twice as high as african americans are represented in the population <unk> 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 246.65 254.94 <NA> and again that was very shocking to many twitter users but it shouldn 't be and the reason it shouldn 't be is that on any day you can go into trending topics
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 254.95 260.69 <NA> and you tend to find topics that are almost entirely african american conversations 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 260.53 270.88 <NA> this was a visualization done by fernando viegas and martin wattenberg two amazing visualization designers who looked at a weekend 's worth of twitter traffic
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 270.83 279.97 <NA> <unk> and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations and in ways that you wouldn 't expect it turns out that oil spill is a mostly white
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 279.75 284.61 <NA> <unk> white conversation that cookout is a mostly black conversation 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 284.62 292.64 <NA> and what 's crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on twitter <unk> it 's literally a quick click away <unk> 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 292.4 304.85 <NA> you click on that cookout tag there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it but generally speaking most of us don 't we end up within these filter bubbles as my friend eli pariser calls them where we see the people we
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 304.81 311.69 <NA> <unk> already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know and we tend not to see that wider picture <unk> 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 311.26 316.58 <NA> now for me i 'm surprised by this because this wasn 't how the internet was supposed to be 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 316.12 324.05 <NA> if you go back into the early days of the internet when cyber utopians like nick negroponte were writing big books like being digital 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 324.05 328.53 <NA> the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force

EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 370.56 379.97 <NA> it turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits if i walk into a store in the united states it 's very very easy for me to

EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 405.7 414.48 <NA> at the moment here 's what i think is going on i think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 414.2 421.24 <NA> we look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world and that 's a framework that includes things like
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 421.03 429.97 <NA> airline routes it includes things like the internet cables we look at a map like this one <unk> and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop

EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 431.12 439.33 <NA> you can get on a flight in london you can end up in bangalore later today two hops you 're in suva the capitol of fiji <unk> it 's all right there 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 439.33 445.18 <NA> when you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks you get a very different picture 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 444.81 454.7 <NA> you start looking at how the global plane flights move <unk> and you suddenly discover that the world isn 't even close to flat it 's extremely lumpy there are parts of the world that are very very well
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 455.14 459.41 <NA> <unk> there 's basically a giant pathway in the sky between london and new york 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 459.21 466.61 <NA> but look at this map and you can watch this for you know two or three minutes you won 't see very many planes go from south america to africa 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 466.61 479.97 <NA> and you 'll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off when we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible and we look at what actually happens we start realizing that the world doesn 't work quite the same way that we think it does
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 480.19 485.31 <NA> <unk> so here 's the problem that i 've been interested in in the last decade or so 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 485.21 489.99 <NA> the world is in fact getting more global it 's getting more connected

EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 507.73 520.43 <NA> and this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world <unk> here 's a slide that alisa miller showed at a previous ted talk alisa 's the president of public radio international and she made a cartogram which is basically a distorted map
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 520.27 525.08 <NA> based on what american television news casts looked at for
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 526 539.76 <NA> <unk> and you see that when you distort a map based on attention the world within american television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated u s and a couple of other countries which we 've invaded <unk> and that 's basically what our media is about 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 539.76 545.79 <NA> and before you conclude that this is just a function of american tv news which is dreadful and i agree that it 's dreadful
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 545.63 554.97 <NA> i 've been mapping elite media like the new york times and i get the same thing when you look at the new york times you look at other elite media what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 554.9 561.77 <NA> <unk> nations and the nations we 've invaded <unk> it turns out that new media isn 't necessarily helping us all that much 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 561.78 569.56 <NA> here 's a map made by mark graham who 's down the street at the oxford internet institute a this is a map of articles in wikipedia that have been geo coded 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 569.32 574.75 <NA> and you 'll notice that there 's a very heavy bias towards north america and western europe even within
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 575.4 583.78 <NA> <unk> where we 're creating their own content online there 's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the wikipedia authors are based rather than to the rest of the world 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 583.56 593.98 <NA> in the u k you can get up you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session you could read a newspaper from india or from australia from canada <unk> god forbid from the u s you probably <unk>
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 593.93 599.96 <NA> won 't <unk> if you look at online media consumption in this case in the top ten users of the internet more
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 600.85 610.73 <NA> <unk> percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites it 's one of these rare cases where the u s is actually slightly better than [ the u k ] because we actually like reading your media rather than vice versa 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 610.33 617.12 <NA> so all of this starts leading me to think that we 're in a state that i refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 616.81 629.97 <NA> we look at the internet <unk> we think we 're getting this wide view of the globe we occasionally stumble onto a page in chinese and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world and we forget
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 629.93 633.6 <NA> <unk> that most of the time we 're checking boston red sox scores
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 633.23 642.94 <NA> <unk> so this is a real problem not just because the red sox are having a bad year but it 's a real problem because as we 're discussing here at ted 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 642.94 646.75 <NA> the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 646.59 654.82 <NA> are global in scale and scope they require global conversations to get to global solutions this is a problem we have to
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 655.4 657.32 <NA> so here 's the good news 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 657.14 661.25 <NA> for six years i 've been hanging out with these guys this is a group called global voices 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 661.25 670.3 <NA> this is a team of bloggers from around the world our mission was to fix the world 's media we started in two thousand and four you might have noticed we haven 't done all that well so far
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 669.9 678.14 <NA> <unk> nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem but the more that i think about it the more that i think that a few things that we have learned
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 677.95 679.61 <NA> along the way are
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 680.11 685.28 <NA> <unk> lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 684.88 690.83 <NA> the first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 690.83 704.97 <NA> in this case the map of the world at night by nasa they 're dark literally because of lack of electricity <unk> and i used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you 're not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs what i 'm starting to realize is that
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 704.98 710.28 <NA> you can get media it 's just an enormous amount of work and you need an enormous amount of encouragement 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 709.79 724.93 <NA> one of those dark spots is madagascar a country which is generally better known for the dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there <unk> and so the people who founded foko club in madagascar weren 't actually concerned with
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 725 728.12 <NA> <unk> trying to change the image of their country they were doing something much simpler 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 727.94 738.1 <NA> it was a club to learn english and to learn computers and the <unk> internet but what happened was that madagascar went through a violent coup most independent media was <unk>
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 738 750.02 <NA> <unk> shut down and the high school students who were learning to blog through foko club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations the violence everything that was going on within this country 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 755.25 762.09 <NA> <unk> publishing their own thoughts publishing independent media <unk> ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country <unk> 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 762.09 766.49 <NA> now the trick with this is that i 'm guessing most people here don 't speak malagasy
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 766.12 779.94 <NA> i 'm also guessing that most of you don 't even speak chinese which is sort of sad if you think about it as it 's now the most represented language on the internet fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this <unk> if you 're using google chrome and you go to a chinese language site you notice this
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 779.9 781.93 <NA> <unk> really cute box at the top 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 781.75 791.98 <NA> which automatically detects that the page is in chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page <unk> unfortunately it 's a machine translation of the page <unk> 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 791.93 798.67 <NA> <unk> and while google is very very good with some languages it 's actually pretty dreadful with chinese and the results can be pretty funny 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 805.14 812.05 <NA> <unk> being can translate this <unk> and if you think this is absurd <unk> it 's not there 's a group right now in china called yeeyan 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 812.05 816.53 <NA> and yeeyan is a group of one hundred and fifty thousand volunteers
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 816.35 829.94 <NA> who get online every day <unk> they look for the most interesting content in the english language they translate roughly one hundred articles a day from major newspapers major websites they put it online for free <unk> it 's the project of a guy named zhang lei
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 830.13 843.65 <NA> who was living in the united states during the lhasa riots and who couldn 't believe how biased american media coverage was and he said if there 's one thing i can do i can start translating so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 843.65 849.93 <NA> and my question to you is if yeeyan can line up one hundred and fifty thousand people to translate the english internet into chinese
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 850.43 852.33 <NA> <unk> where 's the english language yeeyan 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 852.33 861.36 <NA> who 's going after chinese which now has four hundred million internet users out there my guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say <unk> 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 860.9 866.22 <NA> so even if we can find a way to translate from chinese <unk> there 's no guarantee that we 're going to find it 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 866.22 876.19 <NA> when we look for information online we basically have two strategies <unk> we use a lot of search and search is terrific if you know what you 're looking for 
EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 875.96 879.97 <NA> but if what you 're looking for is serendipity if you want to stumble onto something that

EthanZuckerman_2010G 1 EthanZuckerman_2010G 893.31 900.35 <NA> you end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you who have similar interests <unk> and it 's very very hard
