AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 13.75 21.99 <NA> <unk> like to share some works in progress <unk> since we are still realizing these works we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery still <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 21.99 27.77 <NA> so i 'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we 're looking for through each of the works 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 27.34 29.82 <NA> so the first work is called the imperial
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 31.52 38.46 <NA> <unk> sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 38.46 45.31 <NA> within seconds as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer they appear to panic and sort of
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 45.1 54.94 <NA> get into a strict symmetry so this is the sketch of the two states one is total chaos the other is absolute order <unk> and we were interested
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 54.9 59.72 <NA> <unk> in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 59.48 66.43 <NA> this also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions one is the altar tablets of the <unk> 15th century <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 66.43 71.11 <NA> and the other is about one hundred years ago <unk> malevich 's abstract compositions <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 71.13 78.8 <NA> so i 'm just going to take you to a video to give you a sense of scale the largest panel is about two meters high that 's about this much and the smallest one is
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 79.93 83.99 <NA> <unk> so a viewer enters the space <unk> and they snap to attention 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 83.56 87.63 <NA> and after a while if the viewer continues to remain in the space 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 87.63 93.92 <NA> the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 94 100.4 <NA> until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement when they will again snap to attention 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 101.71 104.85 <NA> so here it appears as if it 's the viewer that 's
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 105.02 110.1 <NA> <unk> of instigating the sense of order among the panels but it could also be the other way around that
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 109.61 118.2 <NA> the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 119.18 123.63 <NA> so this brings me to a quieter small work called handheld 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 123.17 129.97 <NA> the viewer sees a piece of paper that 's mounted on the far end of the wall <unk> but when you go closer you see that
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 131.94 136.03 <NA> <unk> piece of paper that 's held on either side by two small hands
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 135.54 141.4 <NA> that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 141.3 147.17 <NA> the viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 147.17 152.59 <NA> as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 152.25 154.88 <NA> <unk> and somehow are not managing to
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 155.14 159.75 <NA> so this instability in the movement very closely resembles
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 159.57 163.53 <NA> the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 163.32 169.92 <NA> so here i 'm going to show you two tandem clips one is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 169.92 173.48 <NA> and you immediately see how the unsteady nature of
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 173.29 174.69 <NA> the video
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 174.53 179.94 <NA> suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view so we 've just removed the camera
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 179.9 187.32 <NA> <unk> and transferred that movement onto the panel <unk> so here 's a video you have to imagine the other hand it 's not there yet <unk> but
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 186.83 196.53 <NA> to us we 're sort of trying to evoke a self effacing gesture <unk> as if there 's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 196.19 202.33 <NA> that sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 202.15 204.91 <NA> piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 207.54 213.07 <NA> the next work is decoy <unk> this is a cardboard model <unk> so the object is about as tall as i am 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 213.07 217.55 <NA> it has a rounded body two arms and a very tall head like antenna <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 217.37 221.39 <NA> and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 221.2 224.96 <NA> so when a viewer passes by it sort of tilts from side
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 225.94 230.33 <NA> <unk> and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 230.83 241.19 <NA> <unk> so here is the first test scenario you see the two movements integrated and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 242.38 249.23 <NA> but the idea is that once it 's got the person 's attention it 's no longer interested and it looks for the next person whose attention to get 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 252.13 254.97 <NA> so this is the final fabricated body of
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 254.96 257.01 <NA> <unk> the decoy <unk> it appears to be <unk>
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 258.01 261.91 <NA> like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 261.91 273.13 <NA> because we are always working from a very personal space we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance at least <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 272.89 279.97 <NA> and so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention <unk> but it could also
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 280.05 282.7 <NA> <unk> be a figure that needs a lot of help 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 283.68 288.4 <NA> the next work is an object that 's also a kind of sound instrument 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 287.94 294.36 <NA> in the shape of an amphitheater that 's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 294.36 299.75 <NA> so from where i 'm standing each of you appears to be this big and the audience sort of takes the entire
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 299.59 303.71 <NA> field of my vision <unk> seated in this audience are nine hundred and
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 305.19 309.39 <NA> they 're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 309.18 314.63 <NA> this means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap how hard for how long 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 314.63 321.14 <NA> how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others <unk> and if they want to contribute to innovation
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 321.82 325.08 <NA> <unk> so when the viewer steps in front of the audience
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 325.28 332.35 <NA> <unk> there will be a response it could be a few claps or a strong applause <unk> and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 332.35 340.33 <NA> and again the audience will respond it could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience or it could be a very loud
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 340.11 348.9 <NA> ovation <unk> so to us i think we 're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 348.47 349.99 <NA> that 's also got
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 351.48 353.89 <NA> <unk> quality to it an instrument <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 353.43 360.8 <NA> so the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied nuanced musical or sound patterns 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 360.8 370.03 <NA> but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response <unk> so there 's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 370.05 379.61 <NA> it also has an alluring and trap like quality to it <unk> so here if you see we 're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 379.99 383.45 <NA> so here 's a small visual animation 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 383.71 390.86 <NA> as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 390.86 393.56 <NA> <unk> and here is a prototype <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 393.31 397.67 <NA> so we can 't wait to be engulfed by nine hundred and ninety six of them okay
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 398.68 399.81 <NA> this is the
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 401.72 402.94 <NA> <unk> it comes out of
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 402.76 406.21 <NA> the idea of a window this is an actual window in our studio <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 406.21 415.84 <NA> and as you can see it 's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections <unk> so we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 415.51 425.05 <NA> that 's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides this grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures they 're also made up of three different sizes 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 425.05 429.34 <NA> as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 430.29 435.62 <NA> <unk> each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 435.44 444.49 <NA> adjacent tracks <unk> so in contrast to this very tight grid we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick like quality
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 444 449.11 <NA> as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 448.83 452.96 <NA> so we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 452.79 454.94 <NA> like they 're oblivious and carefree
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 454.96 462.2 <NA> <unk> and happy go lucky and content <unk> until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 462.1 464.48 <NA> behind the fastest wall <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 464.44 468.62 <NA> so to us this work also presents its own contradiction 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 468.4 475.32 <NA> these figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid which is like a prison but also a fortress <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 475.32 479.37 <NA> because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 479.87 482.07 <NA> <unk> oblivious of the external world 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 482.15 489.44 <NA> so all these real life qualities that i talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 489.45 494.55 <NA> and we were very lucky to collaborate with eth zurich to develop the first prototype <unk> 
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 494.09 500.02 <NA> so you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the
AparnaRao_2013U 1 AparnaRao_2013U 503.25 510.2 <NA> <unk> really quite small you can see it can fit into the palm of my hand <unk> so imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio and here it
