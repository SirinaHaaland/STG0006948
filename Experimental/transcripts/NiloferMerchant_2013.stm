NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 31.49 38.36 <NA> nowadays people are sitting nine point three hours a day which is more than we 're sleeping at seven point seven hours 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 38.37 43.39 <NA> sitting is so incredibly prevalent we don 't even question how much we 're doing it and because
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 43 47.97 <NA> everyone else is doing it it doesn 't even occur to us that it 's not okay 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 47.66 52.95 <NA> in that way sitting has become the smoking of our generation 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 53.84 54.97 <NA> of course there 's
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 54.93 61.43 <NA> <unk> health consequences to this <unk> scary ones <unk> besides the waist things like

NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 81.25 84.95 <NA> what did get me moving was a social interaction 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 84.55 94.07 <NA> someone invited me to a meeting <unk> but couldn 't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting and said i have to walk my dogs tomorrow could you come then it seemed
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 94.27 100.17 <NA> kind of odd to do <unk> and actually that first meeting i remember thinking i have to be the one to ask the next question
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 100.49 102.37 <NA> <unk> i knew i was going to huff
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 102.16 105.27 <NA> and puff during this conversation 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 104.9 108.19 <NA> and yet i 've taken that idea and made it my own <unk> 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 108.19 115.23 <NA> so instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent lit conference room meetings i ask people to go on a walking meeting 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 114.98 118.95 <NA> to the tune of twenty to thirty miles a week 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 119.15 121.14 <NA> it 's changed my life 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 121.58 129.7 <NA> but before that <unk> what actually happened was i used to think about it as you could take care of your health or you could take care of obligations
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 129.87 133.57 <NA> and one always came at the cost of the other <unk> 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 133.32 145.1 <NA> so now <unk> several hundred of these walking meetings later <unk> i 've learned a few things first there 's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out of the box thinking <unk> 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 145.1 149.42 <NA> whether it 's nature or the exercise itself it certainly works 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 149.21 154.94 <NA> and second and probably the more reflective one is just about how much each of us can
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 154.87 157.08 <NA> <unk> hold problems in opposition
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 156.84 159.21 <NA> when they 're really not that way 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 159.21 167.6 <NA> and if we 're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently whether it 's in governance or business or environmental issues <unk> job creation 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 167.26 174.96 <NA> maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true <unk> because it was when that happened with this
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 176.09 185.22 <NA> <unk> that things became doable and sustainable and viable so i started this talk talking about the tush so i 'll end with the bottom line which is 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 185.45 187.35 <NA> walk and talk <unk> 
NiloferMerchant_2013 1 NiloferMerchant_2013 187.04 196.96 <NA> walk the talk you 'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking <unk> and in the way that you do you 'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas
