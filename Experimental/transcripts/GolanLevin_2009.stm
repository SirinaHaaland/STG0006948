GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 23.04 24.96 <NA> people don 't seem to understand me and
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 31.85 37.23 <NA> <unk> we can 't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art and they still haven 't 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 37.23 44.11 <NA> and lest you think that you all as the digerati are more enlightened i went to the apple
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 43.87 49.96 <NA> iphone app store the other day <unk> where 's art <unk> i got productivity i got sports and somehow the
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 50.61 53.08 <NA> <unk> that one would want to make art for the iphone 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 53.08 66.64 <NA> which my friends and i are doing now is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for so from both directions there is kind of i think a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day or her own day <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 66.24 75.02 <NA> which i think artists are obliged to do is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have in my own case i 'm an artist and i 'm really
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 76.39 78.66 <NA> <unk> expanding the vocabulary of human action and
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 78.45 87.98 <NA> basically empowering people through interactivity i want people to discover themselves as actors as creative actors by having interactive experiences
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 87.73 98.18 <NA> a lot of my work is about trying to get away from this this a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine and when i say desktop i don 't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface <unk>
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 98.08 104.97 <NA> <unk> of the desk if you look carefully you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left where the virtual world has literally
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 105.07 107.7 <NA> punched through to the physical <unk> so
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 108.2 116.4 <NA> this is as joy mountford once said the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through and
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 117.41 129.97 <NA> the thing i 'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of of interactive experiences how can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of of exploring aesthetic experiences <unk> not necessarily utilitarian
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 129.93 135.53 <NA> <unk> ones so i write software and that 's how i do it and a lot of my experiences
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 135.29 145.97 <NA> resemble mirrors in some way <unk> because this is in some sense the first way that people discover their own potential as actors and discover their own agency by saying who is that person in the mirror oh it 's actually me 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 145.97 148.49 <NA> and so to give an example 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 148.3 154.97 <NA> this is a project from last year which is called the interstitial fragment processor <unk> and it allows people to explore the negative shapes
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 154.96 159.35 <NA> <unk> that they create when they 're just going about their everyday business <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 172.54 176.78 <NA> <unk> so as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth or with each other 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 179.9 189.69 <NA> <unk> air basically taking what 's often this kind of <unk> unseen space or this this undetected space <unk> and making it something real that people then can appreciate and become creative with <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 189.32 191.85 <NA> so again people discover
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 191.54 199.02 <NA> their creative agency in this way <unk> and their own personalities come out in totally unique ways <unk> so
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 199.08 200.08 <NA> in addition
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 201.12 207.19 <NA> <unk> something that i 've explored now for a while has been the use of the voice <unk> which is an immensely expressive
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 206.79 210.74 <NA> system for us vocalizing song is one of our oldest
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 210.53 212.47 <NA> ways of of making ourselves
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 212.47 225.14 <NA> heard and understood <unk> and i came across this fantastic research by wolfgang khler the so called father of gestalt psychology from one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes <unk> and he said one of them is called
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 228.58 232.88 <NA> <unk> anyone want to hazard a guess <unk> maluma is on
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 232.71 243.14 <NA> top <unk> yeah so as he says here most people answer without any hesitation so what we 're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia <unk> which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have <unk>
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 243.09 254.85 <NA> and so whereas dr oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia where they hear colors or taste shapes and things like this phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent it 's about mappings
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 255.02 265.26 <NA> <unk> different perceptual domains like hardness sharpness brightness and darkness <unk> and the phonemes that we 're able to speak with so seventy years on there 's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed <unk>
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 265.16 279.97 <NA> <unk> out the extent to which you know l m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this and p t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically a relative mapping between
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 279.93 281.93 <NA> <unk> curvature and and shape <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 281.93 291.23 <NA> so it occurred to me <unk> what happens if we could run these backwards and thus was born the project called remark <unk> which is a collaboration with zachary lieberman and the ars electronica futurelab <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 291.02 302.75 <NA> and this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows <unk> so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light <unk> and as you do you see the shadows of your own speech and they sort of fly away out of your head
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 304.84 308.66 <NA> <unk> speech recognition system is able to recognize what you 're saying 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 308.26 316.08 <NA> then it spells it out and if it isn 't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made <unk> so let 's bring up a video of that
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 339.23 344.92 <NA> <unk> okay
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 367.14 374.84 <NA> <unk> this project here i was working with the great abstract vocalist jaap blonk <unk> and he is a world expert in performing the ursonate which is
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 378.67 388.19 <NA> <unk> which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense <unk> and <unk> it 's almost impossible to perform but jaap is one of the world experts in performing it and in this
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 387.91 400.08 <NA> project we 've developed a form of intelligent real time subtitles so these are our live subtitles that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of the ursonate fortunately jaap does
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 400.28 406.17 <NA> <unk> very well and it is delivering that text at the same time as jaap is
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 413.86 419.53 <NA> all the text you 're going to see is real time generated by the computer visualizing what he 's doing with his voice
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 490.49 493.45 <NA> <unk> here you can see the set up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 520.89 529.91 <NA> <unk> the full videos are online if you are interested i got a split reaction to that during the live performance because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron <unk> because usually
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 529.93 533.25 <NA> <unk> someone making them afterwards and then a bunch of people who were
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 534.37 537.44 <NA> <unk> what 's the big deal i see subtitles all the time on television you know 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 537.22 540.36 <NA> they don 't imagine the person in the booth typing it all <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 540.18 543.69 <NA> so in addition to the full body <unk> and in addition to the voice <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 543.69 551.07 <NA> another thing that i 've been really interested in most recently is the use of the the eyes or the gaze in terms of how people relate to each other 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 550.86 554.91 <NA> it 's a really profound amount of nonverbal information that 's communicated with the eyes
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 554.92 569.88 <NA> 's one of the most interesting technical challenges that 's very currently active in the computer sciences being able to have a camera that can understand from a fairly big distance away how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you 're interested in and where your attention is directed <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 569.88 570.97 <NA> so
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 570.78 571.93 <NA> there is a lot of
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 571.72 574.9 <NA> emotional communication that happens there and so i 've been
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 576.42 584.08 <NA> <unk> with a variety of different projects to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes and basically to ask the questions what if
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 583.77 587.26 <NA> art was aware that we were looking at it 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 587.46 599.93 <NA> how could it respond in a way to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we 're looking at it and what could it do if it could look back at us <unk> and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects <unk> in the first one which i 'm going to show you
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 600.88 605.72 <NA> <unk> it 's a piece of interactive software in which if we read this little circle 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 605.44 615.57 <NA> the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer the idea is that it 's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 615.34 624.51 <NA> by different people in an installation <unk> so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo so let 's run this and see if it works
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 627.56 638.7 <NA> <unk> there is lots of nice bright video there is just a little test screen that shows that it 's working and what i 'm just going to do is i 'm going to hide that and you can see here that what it 's doing is it 's recording my eyes every time i blink <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 644.03 647.25 <NA> hello <unk> and i can hello 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 648.08 654.61 <NA> okay and no matter where i am what 's really going on here is that it 's an eye tracking system that tries to locate my eyes and if i get really far away
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 655.55 665.92 <NA> to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way <unk> but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this this laptop then you 'll see these nice crisp eyes you <unk>
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 665.82 678.08 <NA> <unk> can think of it as a way of sort of typing with your eyes and what you 're typing are recordings of your eyes as you 're looking at other peoples ' eyes <unk> so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 679.78 682.9 <NA> <unk> where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 682.68 688.01 <NA> staring at as you see who 's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them <unk> 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 687.61 696.05 <NA> so i 'll just add a couple more blink <unk> blink <unk> and you can see just once again how it 's sort of finding my eyes and and doing its best to
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 695.59 699.96 <NA> estimate when it 's blinking alright let 's leave that so that 's this
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 706.43 711.22 <NA> <unk> last couple pieces i 'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics for me new for me it 's called
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 712.42 716.37 <NA> and i 'm going to show a video of the older version of it which is just a minute long 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 728.52 732.58 <NA> <unk> in response to one 's own blinks so it blinks one second after you do
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 732.93 740.33 <NA> <unk> this is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials just
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 739.97 748.42 <NA> one eye looking at you and eliminating everything else about a face but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of as an element
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 748.17 752.6 <NA> <unk> and at the same time it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 754.81 759.05 <NA> <unk> away if you look at it too long because it gets shy or things like that 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 760.3 767.3 <NA> okay <unk> so the last project i 'm going to show is this new one called snout 
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 768.61 777.78 <NA> it 's an eight foot snout with a googly eye and inside it 's got an 800 pound robot arm that i borrowed

GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 783.53 790.5 <NA> it helps to have good friends i 'm at carnegie mellon we 've got a great robotics institute there i 'd like to show you thing called snout which is
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 790.07 796.18 <NA> the the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it 's continually surprised to see you
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 805.59 814.13 <NA> <unk> its other name is doubletaker taker of doubles it 's always kind of doing a double take what and the idea is basically can it look at you and and make you feel as if like

GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 862.4 866.97 <NA> <unk> got a computer vision system and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 879.3 886.51 <NA> <unk> those are its targets <unk> up there is the skeleton which is actually what it 's trying to do
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 893.04 899.99 <NA> it 's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature <unk> hollywood does this all the time of course <unk> but also have the
GolanLevin_2009 1 GolanLevin_2009 900 907.58 <NA> body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it this language is communicating that it is surprised to see you and it 's interested in looking at you
