SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 235.67 242.75 <NA> i 'd always stutter on my name and there was usually someone who 'd go have you forgotten your name and then everybody would laugh

SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 249.13 254.94 <NA> i spent my childhood feeling that if i spoke <unk> it would become obvious
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 254.99 263.13 <NA> <unk> that that there was something wrong with me that i was not normal so i mostly stayed quiet <unk> 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 263.66 269.88 <NA> and so you see eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work was a huge step for me 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 269.48 275.08 <NA> every time i record audio i fumble my way through saying each sentence many many times

SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 282.51 286.49 <NA> audio editing is like photoshop for your voice i can
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 286.49 291.85 <NA> slow it down speed it up make it deeper add an echo <unk> and if i stutter along the way <unk>

SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 296.28 303.58 <NA> ss using my highly edited voice in my work was a way for me to finally sound normal to myself <unk> 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 303.75 304.91 <NA> but after the
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 304.84 312.44 <NA> <unk> comments on the video <unk> it no longer made me feel normal <unk> and so i stopped using my voice in my work
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 313.48 317.99 <NA> since then i 've thought a lot about what it means to be normal <unk> 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 318.67 325.13 <NA> and i 've come to understand that normal has a lot to do with expectations <unk> 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 324.76 329.97 <NA> let me give you an example <unk> i came across this story about the ancient greek writer homer
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 330.1 334.29 <NA> now homer mentions very few colors in his writing 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 334.13 338.58 <NA> and even when he does he seems to get them quite a bit wrong 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 338.39 346.08 <NA> for example the sea is described as wine red people 's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple but it 's
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 346.31 355 <NA> not just homer if you look at all of the ancient literature ancient chinese icelandic greek indian and even the original hebrew bible
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 355.19 358.6 <NA> they all mention very few colors 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 358.23 371.38 <NA> and the most popular theory for why that might be the case is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make that color so basically if you can make a color only then can you see it 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 371.25 379.94 <NA> a color like red <unk> which was fairly easy for many cultures to make they began to see that color fairly early on but a color like blue which was much
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 379.87 384.57 <NA> <unk> harder to make many cultures didn 't begin to learn how to make that color until much later they didn
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 384.39 391.04 <NA> 't begin to see it until much later as well so until then even though a color might be all around them 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 391.04 397.58 <NA> they simply did not have the ability to see it it was invisible it was not a part of their normal 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 398.08 404.85 <NA> and that story has helped put my own experience into context so when i first read the comments on the video
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 405.05 413.58 <NA> <unk> initial reaction was to take it all very personally but the people commenting did not know how self conscious i am about my voice
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 413.78 418.6 <NA> they were mostly reacting to my accent that it is not normal
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 418.43 424.99 <NA> for a narrator to have an accent <unk> but what is normal anyway <unk> we know that reviewers will find
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 425 428.2 <NA> <unk> more spelling errors in your writing if they think you 're black
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 428.61 433.6 <NA> we know that professors are less likely to help female or minority students <unk> 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 433.86 440.47 <NA> and we know that resumes with white sounding names get more callbacks than resumes with black sounding names 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 440.61 442.45 <NA> why is that 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 442.5 451.97 <NA> because of our expectations of what is normal <unk> we think it is normal when a black student has spelling errors <unk> we think it is normal
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 451.78 454.94 <NA> when a female or minority student does not succeed
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 455.47 460.94 <NA> and we think it is normal that a white employee is a better hire than a black employee <unk> 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 460.9 470 <NA> but studies also show that discrimination of this kind in most cases is simply favoritism and it results more from wanting to help people that you can relate to
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 470.02 479.31 <NA> than the desire to harm people that you can 't relate to and not relating to people starts at a very early age let me give you an example
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 479.9 485.53 <NA> <unk> one library that keeps track of characters in the children 's book collection
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 485.29 498 <NA> every year found that in two thousand and fourteen only about eleven percent of the books had a character of color and just the year before that number was about eight percent <unk> 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 497.54 502.92 <NA> even though half of american children today come from a minority background half so
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 502.82 504.49 <NA> there are two big issues here
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 504.87 512.84 <NA> <unk> number one children are told that they can be anything they can do anything and yet most stories that children of color consume are about people who are not like them
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 512.84 519.07 <NA> number two is that majority groups don 't get to realize the great extent to which they are similar to minorities
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 518.58 523.9 <NA> our everyday experiences <unk> our hopes our dreams our fears
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 523.53 524.96 <NA> and our mutual love
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 529.84 536.12 <NA> <unk> just like the color blue for ancient greeks minorities are not a part of what we consider normal <unk> 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 536.92 544.7 <NA> because normal is simply a construction of what we 've been exposed to and how visible it is around us 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 545.11 548.09 <NA> and this is where things get a bit difficult 
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 548.23 554.94 <NA> i can accept the preexisting notion of normal that normal is good and anything outside of that very
SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 554.87 562.08 <NA> <unk> narrow definition of normal is bad or i can challenge that preexisting notion of normal

SafwatSaleem_2016U 1 SafwatSaleem_2016U 565.85 573.07 <NA> and with my accent and by standing here onstage even though i 'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom
