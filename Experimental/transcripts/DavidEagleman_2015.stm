DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 523.26 525.02 <NA> so a scientist named paul

DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 555.67 567.54 <NA> modern incarnations of this the sonic glasses take a video feed right in front of you and turn that into a sonic landscape <unk> so as things move around and get closer and farther it sounds like bzz bzz bzz

DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 800.55 808.16 <NA> <unk> is that after wearing this for about three months he will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing

DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 818.16 828.38 <NA> now this technology has the potential to be a game changer because the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant and that requires an invasive surgery

DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 876.69 886.81 <NA> <unk> two buttons appear <unk> and he has to make a choice he doesn 't know what 's going on he makes a choice and he gets feedback after one second now here 's the thing the subject has no idea what all the <unk>
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 886.71 896.39 <NA> <unk> patterns mean but we 're seeing if he gets better at figuring out which button to press he doesn 't know that what we 're feeding is real time data from the stock market <unk> 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 901.39 907.23 <NA> <unk> and the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not and what we 're seeing is can we expand the human <unk>
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 907.23 916.64 <NA> <unk> umvelt so that he comes to have after several weeks a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet

DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 922.03 929.73 <NA> here 's another thing we 're doing <unk> during the talks this morning <unk> we 've been automatically scraping twitter for the
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 929.98 938.67 <NA> ted2015 hashtag <unk> and we 've been doing an automated sentiment analysis which means are people using positive words or negative words or neutral

DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 941.31 950.79 <NA> i have been feeling this and so i am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 950.72 954.97 <NA> in real time <unk> and that 's a new kind of human experience
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 954.9 960.04 <NA> <unk> because now i can know how everyone 's doing and how much you 're loving this it
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 966.09 971.35 <NA> 's a bigger experience than a human can normally have 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 971.1 979.94 <NA> we 're also expanding the umvelt of pilots <unk> so in this case the vest is streaming nine different measures from this quadcopter
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 979.87 990.68 <NA> <unk> so pitch and yaw and roll and orientation and heading <unk> and that improves this pilot 's ability to fly it it 's essentially like he 's extending his skin <unk>
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 990.63 1000.35 <NA> up there far away <unk> and that 's just the beginning what we 're envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1004.96 1013.79 <NA> <unk> in a world of information now and there is a difference between accessing big data and experiencing it 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1013.57 1022.08 <NA> so i think there 's really no end to the possibilities on the horizon for human expansion just imagine
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1021.87 1025.08 <NA> an astronaut being able to feel
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1025.25 1028.44 <NA> <unk> overall health of the international space station or
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1028.44 1038.22 <NA> for that matter having you feel the invisible states of your own health like your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome <unk> or having <unk>
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1039.29 1042.9 <NA> <unk> vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1043.04 1049.81 <NA> so the key is this <unk> as we move into the future we 're going to increasingly be able to choose our own
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1051.3 1057.07 <NA> <unk> we no longer have to wait for mother nature 's sensory gifts on her timescales <unk> 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1056.61 1065.17 <NA> but instead like any good parent <unk> she 's given us the tools that we need to go out and define our own trajectory <unk> 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1064.89 1072.95 <NA> so the question now is how do you want to go out and experience your universe <unk> thank you
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1095.14 1096.84 <NA> <unk> first time i felt applause on the vest
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1104.93 1107.58 <NA> <unk> this could be the first experiment that
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1107.33 1110.25 <NA> secures its funding forevermore right 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1110.69 1114.4 <NA> if successful de well that 's right i wouldn 't have to write to nih anymore ca well
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1114.4 1125.02 <NA> look just to be skeptical for a minute <unk> i mean this is amazing but isn 't most of the evidence so far that that sensory substitution works not necessarily that sensory addition works i mean 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1130.98 1135.91 <NA> <unk> the visual cortex is still there ready to process <unk> and that that is needed as part of it de that
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1135.45 1147.14 <NA> 's a great question we actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in the general story though is that it 's extraordinarily flexible so when a person goes blind 
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1147.14 1150.14 <NA> what we used to call their visual cortex gets taken
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1150.07 1160.28 <NA> <unk> over by other things by touch <unk> by hearing by vocabulary <unk> so what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one trick pony it just runs certain kinds of computations <unk>
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1160.18 1167.52 <NA> <unk> on things <unk> and when we look around at things like braille for example people are getting information through bumps on their fingers so
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1176.99 1186.21 <NA> <unk> there are so many possible applications for this are you ready for this what are you most excited about the direction it might go de i mean i think there 's a lot of applications here in terms of
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1186.44 1199.84 <NA> beyond sensory substitution <unk> the things i started mentioning about astronauts on the space station they spend a lot of their time monitoring things and they could instead just get what 's going on because what this is really good for is multidimensional
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1200.82 1210.94 <NA> <unk> the key is this our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges but they 're really bad at what our world has become which is screens with lots and lots of data we have to crawl <unk>
DavidEagleman_2015 1 DavidEagleman_2015 1210.84 1224.87 <NA> <unk> that with our attentional systems <unk> so this is a way of just feeling the state of something just like the way you know the state of your body as you 're standing around so i think heavy machinery safety feeling the state of a factory of your equipment that 's one place it 'll go right away
