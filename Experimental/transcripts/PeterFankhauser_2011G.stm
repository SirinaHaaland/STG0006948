PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 12.88 22.07 <NA> <unk> let me introduce to you rezero this little fellow was developed by a group of ten undergraduate students at the autonomous systems laboratory at <unk>
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 23.8 25.14 <NA> <unk> robot belongs to a family
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 25.04 27.27 <NA> <unk> of robots called ballbots
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 26.96 31.65 <NA> instead of wheels a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 31.34 40.41 <NA> the main characteristics of such a system is that there 's one sole contact point to the ground <unk> this means that the robot is inherently unstable it
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 40.16 43.02 <NA> 's like when i am trying to stand on one foot 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 43.76 49.96 <NA> you might ask yourself what 's the usefulness of a robot that 's unstable <unk> now we 'll explain that in a second 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 50 58.96 <NA> <unk> let me first explain how rezero actually keeps his balance rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 59.43 64.66 <NA> he then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 64.38 71.74 <NA> this happens one hundred and sixty times per second and if anything fails in this process rezero would immediately fall to the ground 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 71.61 75.05 <NA> now to move and to balance rezero needs to turn the ball
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 75.37 83.93 <NA> <unk> the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 85.66 90.47 <NA> due to his instability rezero is always in motion now here 's the trick <unk> 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 90.47 95.81 <NA> it 's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [ dynamically ] 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 95.92 100.17 <NA> let 's play a little you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 105.26 107.16 <NA> <unk> 's trying to maintain his position 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 109.4 116.61 <NA> for the next demo i 'd like you to introduce to my colleagues michael on the computer and thomas who 's helping me onstage 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 118.88 123.06 <NA> in the next mode <unk> rezero is passive and we can move him around 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 124.28 128.05 <NA> with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 133.08 135.1 <NA> can also make him spin
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 146.37 150.34 <NA> in the next mode <unk> we can get rezero to follow a person <unk> 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 152.19 154.88 <NA> he 's now keeping a constant distance to thomas
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 159.46 163.37 <NA> this works with a laser sensor that 's mounted on top of rezero 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 167.62 171.08 <NA> with the same method we can also get him to circle a person <unk>
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 173.68 175.05 <NA> we call this the
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 194.27 196.44 <NA> <unk> what 's the use of this technology
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 197.93 204.01 <NA> <unk> for now it 's an experiment <unk> but let me show you some possible future applications
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 205.35 212.2 <NA> <unk> rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 211.77 216.52 <NA> in a hospital this device could be used to carry around medical equipment 
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 216.09 224.39 <NA> due to the ballbot system it has a very small footprint and it 's also easy to move around and of course who wouldn 't like to take a ride on one of these
PeterFankhauser_2011G 1 PeterFankhauser_2011G 225.97 231.12 <NA> <unk> these are more practical applications <unk> but there 's also a certain beauty within this technology
