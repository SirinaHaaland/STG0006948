ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 27.86 35.04 <NA> <unk> came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon neutral i was so fascinated
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 34.84 40.05 <NA> that i decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer <unk> 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 40.1 47.97 <NA> soon <unk> i started making a forest in the backyard of my own house <unk> and this is how it looks after three years 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 48.29 53.98 <NA> these forests compared to a conventional plantation <unk> grow ten times faster
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 55.01 60.31 <NA> thirty times more dense and one hundred times more biodiverse <unk> 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 60.42 63.89 <NA> within two years of having this forest in our backyard 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 63.89 71.6 <NA> i could observe that the groundwater didn 't dry during summers the number of bird species i spotted in this area doubled <unk> 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 71.37 77.54 <NA> quality of air became better and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 77.38 79.19 <NA> right in the backyard of our house
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 80.05 87.11 <NA> <unk> i wanted to make more of these forests i was so moved by these results that i wanted to make these forests with the same acumen
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 86.91 91.83 <NA> with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 91.83 98.48 <NA> so i founded a company which is an end to end service provider to create these native natural forests <unk> 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 98.5 104.97 <NA> but to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry we had to standardize the process of
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 105.01 111.66 <NA> forest making so we benchmarked the toyota production system known for its quality and efficiency
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 111.38 119.82 <NA> for the process of forest making for an example <unk> the core of tps toyota production system lies in heijunka 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 119.39 125.02 <NA> which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 125.91 132.04 <NA> <unk> replaced these cars with trees <unk> using which now we can make <unk> multi layered forests 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 131.58 138.31 <NA> these forests utilize one hundred percent vertical space <unk> they are so dense that one can 't even walk into them <unk> 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 138.99 140.8 <NA> for an example we can make a <unk>
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 141.87 149.87 <NA> <unk> forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars in order to reduce cost and our own carbon
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 151.24 155.81 <NA> <unk> we started utilizing local biomass as soil amender and fertilizers 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 155.8 161.42 <NA> for example coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw <unk>

ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 165.69 169.73 <NA> is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted <unk> 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 169.73 179.43 <NA> once planted we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn 't get evaporated back into the atmosphere
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 179.87 186.87 <NA> <unk> and using these simple improvisations today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iphone <unk> 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 187.16 195.78 <NA> today we are making forests in houses in schools <unk> even in factories with the corporates but that 's not enough 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 195.53 200.14 <NA> there is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands

ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 206.63 217.12 <NA> where we are going to share our methodology on an open source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 216.78 223.18 <NA> using our methodology at the click of a button <unk> they can get to know all the native species of their place 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 223.62 224.99 <NA> by installing
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 237.67 239.94 <NA> <unk> we can monitor the growth of this forest
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 239.76 242.57 <NA> without being on site 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 243.25 250.01 <NA> this methodology i believe has a potential by sharing we can actually bring back our native forests 
ShubhenduSharma_2014U 1 ShubhenduSharma_2014U 250.01 257.73 <NA> now when you go back home <unk> if you see a barren piece of land do remember that it can be a potential forest thank you very much
