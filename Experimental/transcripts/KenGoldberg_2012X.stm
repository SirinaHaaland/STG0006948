KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 73.38 74.84 <NA> so i couldn 't wait to get
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 100.15 104.97 <NA> <unk> they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 105.22 111 <NA> <unk> and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 111.29 118.65 <NA> but my dad didn 't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and i worked on it for several years <unk> but it was <unk>

KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 288.03 296.95 <NA> by more people than any other robot in history now one day <unk> i got a call out of the blue
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 296.85 303.26 <NA> from a student <unk> who asked a very simple but profound question
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 305.14 307.43 <NA> is the robot real 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 308.11 314.78 <NA> now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it <unk> but i knew what he meant <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 314.32 324.99 <NA> because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 327.05 331.89 <NA> <unk> and the more i thought about it i couldn 't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 332.09 336.18 <NA> this was right about the time that i was offered a position here at berkeley <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 336.35 343.77 <NA> and when i got here <unk> i looked up hubert dreyfus who 's a <unk> world renowned professor of philosophy <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 344.06 351.42 <NA> and i talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 350.93 354.88 <NA> it goes back to the skeptics and up through descartes
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 354.96 361.99 <NA> it 's the issue of epistemology <unk> the study of how do we know that something is true 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 362.07 367.9 <NA> so he and i started working together <unk> and we coined a new term telepistemology 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 368.22 374.5 <NA> the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers

KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 381.61 387.17 <NA> so thanks to this student <unk> who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 387.17 391.34 <NA> this project taught me an important lesson about life <unk>

KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 395.26 403.68 <NA> now the second project i 'll tell you about grew out of the telegarden <unk> as it was operating my students and i were very interested in how people were
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 404.99 410.37 <NA> <unk> other and what they were doing with the garden <unk> so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 409.91 415.86 <NA> and go out into some other interesting environment <unk> like for example what if it could go to a dinner party
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 415.58 425.41 <NA> at the white house so <unk> because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 426.9 431.05 <NA> <unk> we decided that rather than have a robot replace the human
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 430.65 437.47 <NA> to go to the party <unk> we 'd have a human replace the robot we called it the tele actor 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 437.49 442.96 <NA> we got a human <unk> someone who 's very outgoing and gregarious
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 442.74 444.1 <NA> and
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 443.76 446.26 <NA> she was outfitted with a helmet
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 446.26 454.97 <NA> with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection <unk> and the idea was that she could go
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 455.08 463.74 <NA> <unk> into a remote and interesting environment <unk> and then over the internet people could experience what she was experiencing <unk> so they could
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 463.74 471.62 <NA> see what she was seeing <unk> but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 471.31 478.89 <NA> and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 480.53 485 <NA> so we got a chance to take the tele actor to the webby awards
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 485.01 490.59 <NA> in san francisco <unk> and that year sam donaldson was the host

KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 501.51 508.43 <NA> <unk> is going to be joining you onstage this is a new experimental project <unk> and people are watching her on their screens <unk>
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 509.66 510.95 <NA> there 's cameras involved and

KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 530.22 535.22 <NA> she walked right up to him <unk> and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 536.08 539.1 <NA> laughter we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 539.1 546.56 <NA> and he was great he just gave her a big hug in return and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up <unk> i asked <unk>
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 547.62 553.17 <NA> how did the tele directors decide that they would give a kiss to sam donaldson
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 555.11 556.8 <NA> <unk> and she said they hadn 't she
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 556.76 558.06 <NA> said <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 558.06 566.16 <NA> when she was just about to walk onstage the tele directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 569.99 573.51 <NA> laughter so the success of the tele actor that night
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 573.51 579.94 <NA> was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 580.04 588.34 <NA> <unk> and so that project taught me another lesson about life <unk> which is that when in doubt <unk> improvise 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 590.16 597.73 <NA> now the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 598.74 604.97 <NA> he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there 's a related treatment called

KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 613.15 617.58 <NA> and the way it 's done <unk> as you can see here is that surgeons
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 617.35 624.81 <NA> insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all these needles are inserted in
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 626.9 634 <NA> <unk> it 's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 635.74 636.9 <NA> the needles
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 636.77 642.48 <NA> damage these organs cause damage <unk> which leads to trauma and side effects <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 642.05 647.65 <NA> so my students and i wondered what if we could modify
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 647.41 649.96 <NA> the system <unk> so that the needles could come in
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 652.62 667.12 <NA> <unk> so we simulated this we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the radiation <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 666.78 675.32 <NA> so now we 're working with doctors at ucsf and engineers at johns hopkins and we 're building a robot
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 675.79 684.33 <NA> <unk> that has a number of it 's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 684.33 688.2 <NA> and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 687.98 690.92 <NA> and still reach the targets they 're aiming for 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 691.54 699.44 <NA> so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel <unk> this project also taught me an important lesson <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 699.58 702.81 <NA> when in doubt <unk> when your path is blocked
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 705.26 711.28 <NA> and the last project also has to do with medical robotics <unk> and this is
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 711.1 717.63 <NA> something that 's grown out of a system called the da vinci surgical robot <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 717.35 723.78 <NA> and this is a commercially available device it 's being used in over two thousand hospitals around the world
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 723.53 725.05 <NA> <unk> the idea is it allows
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 732.69 738.52 <NA> <unk> many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 738.03 745.21 <NA> and currently all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 744.84 751.7 <NA> so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time <unk> and we 've been wondering what if we could program the robot
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 751.52 754.97 <NA> to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 755.08 764.36 <NA> <unk> to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 764.44 768.38 <NA> it 's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 768.4 775.94 <NA> but it turns out my colleague pieter abbeel <unk> who 's here at berkeley <unk> has developed a new set of techniques
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 775.51 779.91 <NA> for teaching robots from example <unk> so he 's gotten
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 779.81 787.47 <NA> <unk> robots to fly helicopters do incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 787.61 794.8 <NA> so we got one of these robots we started working with pieter and his students and we asked a surgeon
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 794.63 797.26 <NA> to perform a task
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 798.61 804.7 <NA> with the robot so what we 're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 805.19 809.77 <NA> so here 's an example i 'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 809.7 821.05 <NA> so here 's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robot 's path looks like those three examples <unk> now <unk> those are much better than what a novice like me could do <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 820.56 825.05 <NA> but they 're still jerky and imprecise <unk> so we record all these
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 827.71 829.82 <NA> <unk> go through a sequence of steps <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 829.69 838.64 <NA> first <unk> we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition <unk> and this allows us to temporally align all of the examples <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 838.39 842.66 <NA> and then we apply kalman filtering a technique from
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 842.2 851.04 <NA> control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 854.87 865.3 <NA> <unk> human demonstrations they 're all noisy and imperfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 865.3 867.51 <NA> we observe what happens 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 867.08 872.04 <NA> then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 872.66 874.42 <NA> then what we do
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 874.26 879.94 <NA> is we increase the velocity a little bit <unk> we observe the results adjust the controls again
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 879.72 880.9 <NA> <unk> again <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 880.83 890.65 <NA> and observe what happens and we go through this several rounds <unk> and here 's the result that 's the inferred task trajectory and here 's the robot moving at the
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 890.16 896.26 <NA> speed of the human here 's four times the speed of the human here 's seven times <unk> 
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 896.49 900.65 <NA> and here 's the robot operating at ten times
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 900.47 904.97 <NA> the speed of the human so we 're able to get a robot to perform a delicate
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 904.93 913.5 <NA> <unk> task like a surgical subtask at ten times the speed of a human <unk> so this project
KenGoldberg_2012X 1 KenGoldberg_2012X 913.29 920.45 <NA> also because of its involved practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson <unk>
