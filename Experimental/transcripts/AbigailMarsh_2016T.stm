AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 219.69 228.95 <NA> one answer is compassion obviously which is a key driver of altruism <unk> but then the question becomes why do some people seem to have more of it than others
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 230.14 236.75 <NA> <unk> and the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 236.65 241.58 <NA> but to figure out how i actually started from the opposite end 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 241.69 243.74 <NA> with psychopaths 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 244.21 252.92 <NA> a common approach to understanding basic aspects of human nature like the desire to help other people is to study people in whom that desire is missing <unk>

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 293.13 297.97 <NA> and in particular they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 298.2 304.97 <NA> and fearful expressions convey urgent need and emotional distress <unk> and they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 304.99 311.75 <NA> <unk> people who see them so it makes sense that people who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 312.04 317.6 <NA> the part of the brain that 's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 317.26 325.1 <NA> there are very rare cases of people who lack amygdalas completely <unk> and they 're profoundly impaired in recognizing fearful expressions <unk>

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 340.76 348.03 <NA> finally <unk> psychopaths ' amygdalas are smaller than average by about eighteen or twenty percent <unk> so
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 347.87 350.17 <NA> all of these findings are reliable
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 350.79 359.44 <NA> <unk> and they 're very interesting <unk> but remember that my main interest is not understanding why people don 't care about others it 's understanding why they do 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 359.43 366.77 <NA> so the real question is could extraordinary altruism <unk> which is the opposite of psychopathy
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 366.59 374.66 <NA> in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy a sort of
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 377.86 380.84 <NA> <unk> better able to recognize other people 's fear <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 380.56 385.73 <NA> an amygdala that 's more reactive to this expression and maybe larger than average as well 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 385.45 389.24 <NA> as my research has now shown all three things are true <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 389.24 397.91 <NA> and we discovered this by testing a population of truly extraordinary altruists these are people who have given one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 398.05 400.2 <NA> so these are people who have volunteered
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 400 404.14 <NA> <unk> to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 403.96 412.23 <NA> and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they 've never met and may never meet why would anybody do this is a very common question <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 412.07 418.5 <NA> and the answer may be that the brains of these extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 418.58 425.35 <NA> they are better at recognizing other people 's fear <unk> they 're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 425.52 434.82 <NA> <unk> this may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions <unk> and remember this is the same part of the brain that we found was underreactive in people who are psychopathic <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 434.82 439.51 <NA> and finally their <unk> amygdalas are larger than average as well by about eight percent <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 439.44 445.28 <NA> so together what these data suggest is the existence of something like a caring continuum in the world
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 445.04 453.08 <NA> that 's anchored at the one end by people who are highly psychopathic <unk> and at the other by people who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 454.96 458.52 <NA> <unk> should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 458.28 462.35 <NA> is not just that they 're more compassionate than average they are 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 462.04 471.14 <NA> but what 's even more unusual about them is that they 're compassionate and altruistic not just towards people who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 470.83 476.09 <NA> <unk> right because to have compassion for people that you love and identify with is not

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 480.23 487.41 <NA> <unk> extends way beyond that circle even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances to people who are outside their social circle altogether <unk>

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 491.54 499.9 <NA> and i 've had the opportunity now to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate such a wide circle of compassion
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 499.67 504.85 <NA> that they were willing to give a complete stranger their kidney <unk> and i found it 's a really difficult
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 504.78 508 <NA> <unk> question for them to answer <unk> i say 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 508.05 512.8 <NA> how is it that you 're willing to do this thing when so many other people don 't you
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 512.34 520 <NA> 're one of fewer than two thousand americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger what is it that makes you so special 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 519.96 522.07 <NA> and what do they say 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 522.9 525.17 <NA> they say nothing
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 526.18 530.24 <NA> <unk> there 's nothing special about me <unk> i 'm just the same as everybody else 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 530.74 538.76 <NA> and i think that 's actually a really telling answer <unk> because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don 't look like this 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 538.81 542.87 <NA> they look more like this they have no center 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 542.86 550.02 <NA> these altruists literally don 't think of themselves as being at the center of anything as being better or more inherently important
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 550 558.3 <NA> <unk> than anybody else when i asked one altruist why donating her kidney made sense to her she said because it 's not about me 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 558.59 560.58 <NA> another said 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 560.36 569.19 <NA> i 'm not different <unk> i 'm not unique <unk> your study here is going to find out that i 'm just the same as you i think the best description for this amazing lack of <unk>
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 570.28 579.04 <NA> is humility <unk> which is that quality that in the words of st augustine makes men as angels <unk> and why is that
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 579.96 589.36 <NA> <unk> because if there 's no center of your circle there can be no inner rings or outer rings nobody who is more or less worthy of your care and compassion than anybody else <unk>

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 594.96 600.08 <NA> but i also think that this is a view of the world that 's attainable by many and maybe even most people
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 600.97 607.4 <NA> <unk> and i think this because at the societal level <unk> expansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 607.45 615.98 <NA> the psychologist steven pinker and others have shown that all around the world people are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever widening circles of others <unk>

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 636.26 645.72 <NA> is it possible that a hundred years from now people will think that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood and bone marrow is today <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 645.5 647.13 <NA> maybe 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 647.33 650.26 <NA> so what 's at the root of all these amazing changes
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 650.67 652.36 <NA> <unk> in part it seems to be
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 652.16 656.17 <NA> increases in wealth and standards of living <unk> 
AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 656.16 661.99 <NA> as societies become wealthier and better off people seem to turn their focus of attention outward

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 672.42 679.88 <NA> all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result <unk> which is that even as the world is becoming a better

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 696.59 699.21 <NA> and so we now care a lot more

AbigailMarsh_2016T 1 AbigailMarsh_2016T 705.64 712.71 <NA> that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence maybe even more so
