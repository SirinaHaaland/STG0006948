JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 32.69 42.9 <NA> you might be interested to know that the <unk> crispr technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 42.83 49.87 <NA> bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 49.63 54.61 <NA> a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb before it gets destroyed
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 55.23 64.66 <NA> <unk> so many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called crispr that allows them to detect viral dna and destroy it 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 64.56 69.1 <NA> part of the crispr system is a protein called cas9

JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 97.03 104.88 <NA> that would offer opportunities to do things that really haven 't been possible in the past the crispr technology has already been
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 104.81 106.77 <NA> <unk> used to change the dna

JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 154.98 162.56 <NA> ethical and societal implications of a technology like this what i want to do now is tell you
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 162.13 166.11 <NA> what the <unk> crispr technology is what it can do 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 166.11 173.12 <NA> where we are today and why i think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 174.55 179.85 <NA> when viruses infect a cell they inject their dna and in a

JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 205.34 208.3 <NA> you can see why we use the acronym <unk> crispr 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 208.38 218.02 <NA> it 's a mechanism that allows cells to record over time the viruses they they have been exposed to and importantly those bits of dna <unk>
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 217.92 227.2 <NA> <unk> are passed on to the cells <unk> ' progeny so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation but over many generations of cells 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 229.66 239.66 <NA> <unk> record of infection and as my colleague blake wiedenheft likes to say the crispr locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells <unk> 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 240.04 250.17 <NA> once those bits of dna have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called rna which is orange
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 257.06 265.26 <NA> <unk> a chemical cousin of dna and it allows interaction with dna molecules that have a matching sequence 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 264.77 274.69 <NA> so those little bits of rna from the crispr locus associate they bind to protein called cas9 which is white in the picture <unk> 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 274.69 279.97 <NA> and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell it searches through

JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 314.61 318.77 <NA> and importantly <unk> this complex is programmable 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 318.77 327.44 <NA> so it can be programmed to recognize particular dna sequences <unk> and make a break in the dna at that site 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 327.4 329.64 <NA> as i 'm going to tell you now we
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 329.6 334.09 <NA> <unk> recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 334.09 341.4 <NA> to allow cells to make a very precise change to the dna at the site where this break was introduced 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 341.03 348.12 <NA> that 's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word processing program to fix a typo in a document 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 349.01 354.28 <NA> the reason we envisioned using the crispr system for genome engineering
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 353.97 354.97 <NA> is because
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 354.93 359.41 <NA> <unk> cells have the ability to detect broken dna and repair it 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 359.25 373.87 <NA> so when a plant or an animal cell detects a double stranded break in its dna it can fix that break either by pasting together the ends of the broken dna with a little tiny change in the sequence of that position 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 373.47 379.88 <NA> or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of dna at the site of the cut
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 380.56 383.73 <NA> so if we have a way to introduce <unk>
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 383.55 390.24 <NA> <unk> double stranded breaks into dna at precise places <unk> we can trigger cells to repair those breaks

JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 395.38 402.81 <NA> so if we were able to program the <unk> crispr technology to make a break in dna at the position
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 402.65 404.97 <NA> at or near a mutation
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 405.11 409.8 <NA> <unk> causing cystic fibrosis for example <unk> we could trigger cells to repair
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 409.8 416.23 <NA> that mutation genome engineering is actually not new it 's been in development since the
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 417.31 424.62 <NA> we 've had technologies for sequencing dna for copying dna and even for manipulating dna 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 425.37 431.53 <NA> <unk> these technologies were very promising but the problem was that they were either
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 431.04 441.43 <NA> inefficient or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories or certainly for
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 441.2 451.06 <NA> many clinical applications so the opportunity to take a technology like crispr and utilize it
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 451.06 454.76 <NA> has appeal because of its relative simplicity
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 454.99 458.84 <NA> <unk> we can think of older genome engineering technologies
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 458.38 466.31 <NA> as similar to having to rewire your computer each time you want to run a new piece of software 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 465.82 473.9 <NA> whereas the <unk> crispr technology is like software for the genome we can program it easily using these little bits of rna 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 476.39 479.63 <NA> <unk> break is made in dna we can induce repair 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 479.63 489.84 <NA> and thereby potentially achieve astounding things like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause huntington 's disease <unk> 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 489.38 498.06 <NA> i actually think that the first applications of the <unk> crispr technology are going to happen in the blood where it 's relatively easier to
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 497.75 499.93 <NA> deliver this tool into

JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 503.43 510.06 <NA> right now a lot of the work that 's going on applies to animal models of human disease such as mice 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 510.06 523.49 <NA> the technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to to study the way that these changes in the cell 's dna affect either a tissue or in this case an entire organism 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 523.28 529.97 <NA> now in this example the <unk> crispr technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 529.96 531.15 <NA> <unk> in the dna
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 530.97 538.45 <NA> in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice <unk> imagine that these white mice
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 538.29 545.87 <NA> differ from their pigmented litter mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome 
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 545.44 554.97 <NA> and they 're otherwise completely normal <unk> and when we sequence the dna from these animals we find that the change in the dna has occurred at exactly the place

JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 579.98 588.53 <NA> we also want to understand better how to control the way that dna is repaired after it 's cut and also to figure out how to
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 588.32 592.93 <NA> control and limit any kind of off target or unintended
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 592.93 599.93 <NA> effects of using the technology <unk> i think that we will see clinical application

JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 672.62 679.97 <NA> a tool to make such changes once that knowledge becomes available this raises a number of ethical
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 680.02 683.39 <NA> <unk> questions that we have to to carefully consider and
JenniferDoudna_2015G 1 JenniferDoudna_2015G 683.22 697.73 <NA> this is why i and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the crispr technology in human embryos to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of of doing so
