SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 19.3 27.81 <NA> <unk> still some confusion about that question as this is a fairly new field of research for example <unk> i was talking to one of my
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 30.19 31.86 <NA> <unk> and he was telling me 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 31.49 40.92 <NA> sandrine this is puzzling some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 41.03 49.72 <NA> and i responded to him well from my point of view that makes sense the drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 49.56 54.7 <NA> also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 55.29 63.85 <NA> and then robert looked at me like i was crazy and said but sandrine these are adult patients adults do not grow new nerve cells 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 64.05 71.87 <NA> and much to his surprise i said well actually we do and this is a phenomenon that we call
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 79.75 81.06 <NA> <unk> medical school
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 80.85 87.77 <NA> he was not taught what we know now that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 88.66 90.89 <NA> so robert you
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 91.03 100.08 <NA> know being the good doctor that he is wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better and i took
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 101.12 106.23 <NA> <unk> of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 105.77 113.25 <NA> and this is the hippocampus <unk> so this is this gray structure in the center of the brain 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 113.09 121.17 <NA> and what we 've known already for very long is that this is important for learning memory mood and emotion <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 120.8 124.36 <NA> however what we have learned more recently
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 124.13 129.79 <NA> is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 129.72 138.61 <NA> <unk> neurons can be generated <unk> and if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in what you actually see here in blue
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 138.38 143.47 <NA> is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 144.15 149.75 <NA> so when it comes to the human brain my colleague jonas frisn from the
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 152.26 158.87 <NA> <unk> that we produce seven hundred new neurons per day in the hippocampus <unk>
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 158.68 166.67 <NA> you might think this is not much compared to the billions of neurons we have but by the time we turn fifty we
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 166.21 171.39 <NA> will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 171.21 179.97 <NA> with adult born neurons so why are these new neurons important and what are their functions
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 180.22 189.66 <NA> <unk> first we know that they 're important for learning and memory and in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 189.49 195.36 <NA> to produce new neurons in the hippocampus then we block certain memory abilities <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 194.99 200.61 <NA> and this is especially new and true for spatial
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 201.02 204.94 <NA> recognition so like how you navigate your way in the
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 204.87 205.87 <NA> <unk> city 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 205.74 213.49 <NA> we are still learning a lot <unk> and neurons are not only important for memory capacity but also for the quality of the memory 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 213.49 226.46 <NA> and they will have been helpful to add time to our memory and they will help differentiate very similar memories like how do you find your bike that you park at the station
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 226.29 229.97 <NA> every day in the same area <unk> but in a slightly different position
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 231.58 239.81 <NA> and more interesting to my colleague robert is the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 239.47 244.59 <NA> so in an animal model of depression we have seen that we have a lower level
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 244.23 246.44 <NA> of neurogenesis 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 245.98 254.52 <NA> and if we give antidepressants then we increase the production of these newborn neurons <unk> and we decrease the symptoms of depression
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 255.38 265.35 <NA> <unk> establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression <unk> but moreover if you just block neurogenesis <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 265.01 268.77 <NA> then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 269.21 277.65 <NA> so by then robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 277.65 279.85 <NA> because the cancer drug had stopped
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 279.99 284.43 <NA> <unk> newborn neurons from being generated <unk> and it will take time to generate
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 284.27 288.43 <NA> new neurons that reach normal functions <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 289.23 290.58 <NA> so 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 290.59 300.89 <NA> collectively now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 300.7 304.82 <NA> or mood or even prevent the decline associated with aging
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 305.08 307.52 <NA> <unk> or associated with stress <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 307.72 312.77 <NA> so the next question is can we control neurogenesis 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 312.55 317.81 <NA> the answer is yes <unk> and we are now going to do a little quiz <unk>
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 317.65 324.69 <NA> i 'm going to give you a set of behaviors and activities <unk> and you tell me if you think they will increase
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 338.42 342.39 <NA> <unk> increase the production of these new neurons <unk> how about stress 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 342.98 349.87 <NA> yes <unk> stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus <unk> how about sleep deprivation <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 359.25 367.48 <NA> <unk> you are right it will increase the production of new neurons <unk> however it 's all about balance here we don 't want to fall in a situation 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 368.52 371.75 <NA> about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 379.81 388.55 <NA> <unk> neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older <unk> but it is still occurring <unk> and then finally how about running
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 388.72 393.2 <NA> <unk> i will let you judge that one by yourself <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 393.01 403.83 <NA> so this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors rusty gage from the salk institute showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 403.83 404.94 <NA> and here you see a
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 404.84 407.32 <NA> <unk> section of the hippocampus
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 407.08 414.9 <NA> of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage <unk> and the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons to be 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 414.74 425.08 <NA> and now you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage so you see the massive increase of the black
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 431.46 433.06 <NA> <unk> but that 's not all 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 433.11 442.15 <NA> what you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus <unk> so here we have a sample of diet
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 441.72 448.24 <NA> of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy <unk> and i 'm just going to point a few out
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 447.78 453.71 <NA> to you calorie restriction of twenty to thirty percent will increase neurogenesis
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 454.75 459.6 <NA> <unk> fasting spacing the time between your meals will increase neurogenesis <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 459.6 466.25 <NA> intake of flavonoids <unk> which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries <unk> will increase neurogenesis
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 465.79 472.91 <NA> omega 3 fatty acids <unk> present in fatty fish like salmon <unk> will increase the production of these new neurons <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 472.96 479.97 <NA> conversely a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 480.77 485.76 <NA> ethanol intake of alcohol will decrease neurogenesis <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 485.42 487.03 <NA> however 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 487.03 495.72 <NA> not everything is lost resveratrol <unk> which is contained in red wine has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 495.26 499.54 <NA> so next time you are at a dinner party you might want to reach for this possibly
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 505.01 514.94 <NA> let me point out the last one a quirky one so japanese groups are fascinated with food textures and they have shown that actually soft diet
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 514.7 522.13 <NA> impairs neurogenesis <unk> as opposed to food that requires mastication chewing or crunchy food <unk> 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 522.3 529.1 <NA> so all of this data <unk> where we need to look at the cellular level has been generated using animal
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 529.93 536.26 <NA> but this diet has also been given to human participants and what we could see
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 536.04 549.14 <NA> is that the diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis <unk> such as calorie restriction will improve memory capacity
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 551.84 560.1 <NA> <unk> exacerbate symptoms of depression as opposed to omega 3 fatty acids which increase neurogenesis and also help
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 559.94 562.83 <NA> to decrease the symptoms of depression
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 563 576.75 <NA> <unk> so we think that the effect of diet on mental health on memory and mood is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 576.74 579.76 <NA> and it 's not only what you eat <unk> but it 's also the
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 580.17 584.29 <NA> <unk> of the food when you eat it and how much of it you eat 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 585.33 597.7 <NA> on our side neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis we need to understand better the function of these new neurons <unk> and how we can control their survival and their production 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 597.7 603.04 <NA> we also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of robert 's patients 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 602.79 604.97 <NA> and on your side i leave
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 604.93 608.69 <NA> <unk> you in charge of your neurogenesis <unk> thank you margaret heffernan 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 614.35 619.28 <NA> fantastic research sandrine now i told you you changed my life
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 618.94 625.08 <NA> i now eat a lot of blueberries sandrine thuret very good mh i 'm really interested in the running
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 626.81 629.16 <NA> <unk> do i have to run 
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 628.85 639.3 <NA> or is it really just about aerobic exercise getting oxygen to the brain could it be any kind of vigorous exercise st so for the moment we can 't really say if it 's <unk>
SandrineThuret_2015S 1 SandrineThuret_2015S 639.25 646.02 <NA> just the running itself <unk> but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production
