FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 70.99 79.97 <NA> and just change the year seeing how it was one hundred years before one thousand years before is that possible can i reconstruct social networks
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 80.14 86.78 <NA> <unk> of the past can i make a facebook of the middle ages so can i build time machines 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 87.34 93.47 <NA> maybe we can just say no it 's not possible or maybe we can think of it from an information point of view 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 93.7 97.07 <NA> this is what i call the information mushroom 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 97.15 103.59 <NA> vertically you have the time and horizontally the amount of digital information available obviously in the last ten years we have
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 105.05 108.51 <NA> <unk> and obviously the more we go in the past <unk> the less information we have 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 108.5 117.24 <NA> if we want to build something like google maps of the past or facebook of the past we need to enlarge this space we need to make that like a rectangle how do we do that 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 116.96 122.73 <NA> one way is digitization there 's a lot of material available newspaper <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 122.6 126.63 <NA> printed books <unk> thousands of printed books <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 127.07 129.94 <NA> i can digitize all these <unk> i can extract
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 129.87 137.62 <NA> <unk> information from these of course <unk> the more you go in the past the less information you will have so it might not be enough <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 137.85 145.57 <NA> so i can do what historians do <unk> i can extrapolate this is what we call in computer science simulation

FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 175.04 181.56 <NA> <unk> to construct a time machine we need two things we need very large archives and we need excellent specialists 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 182.27 191.16 <NA> the venice time machine <unk> the project i 'm going to talk to you about is a joint project between the <unk> epfl and the university of venice ca 'foscari there 's
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 191.33 199.93 <NA> something very peculiar about venice that its administration has been very very bureaucratic they 've been keeping
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 205.56 209.12 <NA> <unk> you have eighty kilometers of archives documenting every aspect
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 208.91 217.3 <NA> of the life of venice over more than one thousand years you have every boat that goes out every boat that comes in you have every change that was made in the city 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 216.93 219.01 <NA> this is all there 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 220.23 224.14 <NA> we are setting up a 10 year digitization program
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 224.13 229.7 <NA> which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 230.04 234.35 <NA> the type of objective we want to reach is four hundred and fifty books a day
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 233.92 236.03 <NA> that can be digitized 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 236.11 242.61 <NA> of course when you digitize that 's not enough <unk> because these documents most of them are in latin in tuscan 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 242.61 249.84 <NA> in venetian dialect <unk> so you need to transcribe them to translate them in some cases to index them and this is obviously not
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 251.03 257.38 <NA> <unk> in particular traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts they do not work
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 257.14 259.68 <NA> well on the handwritten document <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 259.97 268.56 <NA> so the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain speech recognition this is a domain of something that seems impossible which can actually
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 268.52 275.11 <NA> be done <unk> simply by putting additional constraints <unk> if you have a very good model of a language which is used
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 275.1 282.01 <NA> <unk> if you have a very good model of a document how well they are structured and these are administrative documents they are well structured in many cases <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 282.01 288.76 <NA> if you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subset actually shares similar features <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 288.27 290.68 <NA> then there 's a chance of success <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 294.3 300.58 <NA> if we reach that stage then there 's something else <unk> we can extract from this document events 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 300.72 304.64 <NA> actually probably ten billion events can be extracted from this archive
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 304.93 311.3 <NA> and this giant information system can be searched in many ways you can ask questions like who lived in this palazzo in <unk>
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 312.39 315.08 <NA> how much cost a sea bream at the realto market <unk>
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 316.32 324.99 <NA> what was the salary of a glass maker in murano maybe over a decade you can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 325.79 330.3 <NA> <unk> and then what you can do is put that in space because much of this information is spatial 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 329.84 337.78 <NA> and from that you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 337.36 343.89 <NA> over a thousand years managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 343.61 347.55 <NA> you can reconstruct that journey visualize it in many different ways <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 347.84 354.91 <NA> but of course you cannot understand venice if you just look at the city you have to put it in a larger european context so the idea is also
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 354.92 358.09 <NA> to document all the things that worked at the european level 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 358.83 365.54 <NA> we can reconstruct also the journey of the venetian maritime empire how it progressively controlled the adriatic sea <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 365.54 370.87 <NA> how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time

FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 377.04 379.67 <NA> but you can even do other things
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 379.69 385.88 <NA> <unk> because in these maritime routes there are regular patterns <unk> you can go one step
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 385.45 391.22 <NA> beyond and actually create a simulation system create a mediterranean simulator
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 391.12 397.56 <NA> which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing which would enable us to
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 397.56 403.68 <NA> have questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner if i am in corfu in june
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 405.16 407.19 <NA> and want to go to constantinople 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 407.39 413.85 <NA> where can i take a boat probably we can answer this question with one or two or three days <unk> '
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 413.84 419.91 <NA> precision how much will it cost what are the chance of encountering pirates 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 420.53 425.05 <NA> of course you understand the central scientific challenge of a project like
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 427.2 434.89 <NA> <unk> quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process <unk> there are errors everywhere

FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 442.56 450.05 <NA> <unk> in translation interpretative biases <unk> and on top of that if you add algorithmic processes you 're going to have errors
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 454.15 456.98 <NA> <unk> so you have very very uncertain data <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 458.29 465.35 <NA> so how can we detect and correct these these inconsistencies how can we represent that form of uncertainty <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 465.55 467.24 <NA> it 's difficult 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 466.93 475.41 <NA> one thing you can do is document each step of the process not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta historical information 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 475.41 478.2 <NA> how is historical knowledge constructed <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 478.01 479.43 <NA> documenting each step
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 479.99 492.57 <NA> <unk> that will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of venice but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of venice maybe there 's not a single map maybe there are several maps 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 492.59 499.93 <NA> the system should allow for that because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty which is really new for this type
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 503.55 507.85 <NA> <unk> and how should we communicate this new research to a large audience <unk> 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 508.5 511.45 <NA> again venice is extraordinary for that

FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 530.89 539.57 <NA> <unk> imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the venice of a given year <unk> some experience you could share within a group 
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 539.17 549.99 <NA> on the contrary imagine actually that you start from a document a venetian manuscript and you show actually what you can construct out of it how it is decoded how the context of
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 550 554.27 <NA> document can be recreated this is an image from an exhibit which is currently
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 554.28 562.86 <NA> conducted in geneva with that type of system so to conclude <unk> we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 563.15 567.69 <NA> an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences thirty years ago

FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 571.22 579.97 <NA> a question of scale <unk> we see projects which are much beyond any single research team can
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 579.99 585.34 <NA> <unk> do <unk> and this is really new for the humanities which very often
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 585.03 587.23 <NA> take the habit of working

FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 599.88 601.82 <NA> so what we must do
FredericKaplan_2013X 1 FredericKaplan_2013X 601.65 604.7 <NA> for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new
