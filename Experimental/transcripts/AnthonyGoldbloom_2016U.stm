AnthonyGoldbloom_2016U 1 AnthonyGoldbloom_2016U 191.99 201.33 <NA> machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations and this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate

AnthonyGoldbloom_2016U 1 AnthonyGoldbloom_2016U 253.82 261.75 <NA> it will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing campaigns <unk> and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy 
AnthonyGoldbloom_2016U 1 AnthonyGoldbloom_2016U 261.47 270.75 <NA> so yahli whatever you decide to do <unk> let every day bring you a new challenge <unk> if it does then you will stay ahead of the machines
