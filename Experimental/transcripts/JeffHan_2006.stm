JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 18.19 24.99 <NA> really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person because i really really think this is going to really change the way we
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 33.35 42.04 <NA> <unk> normal touch sensors that you see like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards can only register one point of contact at a time <unk> this thing allows you to have
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 42.04 49.93 <NA> multiple points at the same time they can use both my hands <unk> i can use chording actions <unk> i can just go right up and use all ten fingers if i wanted
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 55.35 62.23 <NA> <unk> isn 't completely new <unk> people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the ' 80s however the approach i built here is actually
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 64.49 67.75 <NA> and probably most importantly <unk> very scalable so 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 67.29 76.72 <NA> the technology you know <unk> isn 't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility what 's really interesting here is what you can do with it
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 77.31 79.91 <NA> and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 80.95 85.64 <NA> see <unk> so for instance we have
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 85.21 88.82 <NA> a lava lamp application here <unk> now you can see 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 88.69 94.97 <NA> i can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together i can inject heat into the system here
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 94.75 104.13 <NA> <unk> or i can pull it apart with two of my fingers it 's completely intuitive there 's no instruction manual the interface just kind of disappears this started out as a screensaver app that one of the
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 104.99 109.62 <NA> <unk> our lab ilya rosenberg made but i think its true
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 109.42 111.45 <NA> identity comes out here <unk> 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 111.8 117.48 <NA> now what 's great about a multi touch sensor is that you know <unk> i could be doing this with as many fingers here <unk> 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 117.32 124.93 <NA> but of course multi touch also inherently means <unk> multi user chris could be interacting with another part of lava while i play around with it here you can
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 125.73 133.24 <NA> <unk> new kind of sculpting tool where i 'm kind of warming something up making it malleable and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 137.16 139.9 <NA> google should have something like this in their lobby i 'll
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 145.62 150.02 <NA> show you a little more of a concrete example here <unk> as this thing
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 152.11 158.07 <NA> <unk> is a photographer 's light box application again i can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around <unk> 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 158.07 165.47 <NA> but what 's even cooler is that if i have two fingers <unk> i can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily i
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 165.22 166.35 <NA> can
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 166.13 168.2 <NA> pan zoom and rotate it
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 167.83 176.93 <NA> effortlessly <unk> i can do that grossly with both of my hands or i can do it just with two two fingers on each of my hands together if i grab the canvas i can do the same thing
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 176.93 179.97 <NA> stretch it out i can do it simultaneously holding this down and gripping
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 179.99 187.83 <NA> <unk> another one stretching this out again the interface just disappears here there 's no manual this is exactly what you expect
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 187.83 193.77 <NA> especially if you haven 't interacted with a computer before now when you have initiatives like the $ one hundred laptop
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 193.34 200.29 <NA> i kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new generation to computing with this standard <unk> mouse and windows pointer interface
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 200.64 206.26 <NA> <unk> this is something that i think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on now 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 212.85 215.29 <NA> of course i can bring up a keyboard 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 219.54 225.02 <NA> and i can bring that around put that up there <unk> <unk> obviously this is a standard keyboard but
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 226.09 227.99 <NA> <unk> make it work well for my hands
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 227.79 241.53 <NA> that 's really important because there 's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device that leads to bad things like rsi we have so much technology nowadays that these these interfaces should start conforming to us
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 242.41 244.28 <NA> there 's so little
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 243.91 249.93 <NA> applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on this keyboard is
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 250.43 261.94 <NA> <unk> really wrong direction to go you can imagine in the future as we develop this kind of technology a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away and really intelligently anticipates which key you 're trying to stroke
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 279.87 285.04 <NA> <unk> make these little fuzz balls it 'll remember the strokes i 'm making of course i can do it with all my hands <unk> it 's <unk>
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 288.03 296.54 <NA> <unk> what 's neat about that is i showed that two finger gesture that zooms in really quickly because you don 't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool you can just
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 296.54 298.72 <NA> continuously make things
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 298.32 304.97 <NA> in real multiple scales all at the same time i can create big things out here <unk> but i can go back and really quickly go back
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 304.9 311.33 <NA> <unk> to where i started and make even smaller things here <unk> this is going to be really important
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 311.29 324.93 <NA> as we start getting to things like data visualization for instance <unk> i think we all enjoyed hans rosling 's talk and he really emphasized the fact i 've been thinking about for a long time we have all this great data but for some reason it 's just sitting there we 're not accessing it and
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 330.11 341.64 <NA> <unk> will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools but i also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces to be able to drill down into this kind of data <unk> while still thinking about the big picture here let
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 342.02 346.36 <NA> me show you another app here <unk> this is called worldwind it 's done by nasa
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 354.96 360.13 <NA> <unk> that nasa 's collected over the years <unk> as you can see i can use the same two fingered gestures to go down
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 359.85 366.55 <NA> and go in really seamlessly there 's no interface again it really allows anybody to kind of go in
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 366.33 373.03 <NA> and it just does what you 'd expect you know <unk> again there 's just no interface here the interface just disappears <unk> 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 375 379.16 <NA> i can switch to different data views that 's what 's neat about this app here <unk> 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 378.85 384.98 <NA> nasa 's really cool these <unk> hyper spectral images are false colored so you can it 's really good for determining
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 385.21 394.56 <NA> vegetative use well let 's go back to this the great thing about mapping applications it 's not really
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 404.93 415.15 <NA> <unk> not just simply relegated to a kind of 2d panning and motion <unk> this gesture is just putting two fingers down it 's defining an axis of tilt and i can tilt up and down that way 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 415.1 421.41 <NA> <unk> we just came up with that on the spot it 's probably not the right thing to do but there 's such interesting things you can do with this interface it 's
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 423.5 425.08 <NA> just so much fun playing
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 428.64 430.48 <NA> <unk> the last thing i want to show you is
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 430.02 435.35 <NA> i 'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing i 'm more
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 435.35 441.67 <NA> interested in the creative applications we can do with this now here 's a simple application here i can draw out a curve <unk> 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 442.74 445.24 <NA> and when i close it it becomes
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 445.23 454.85 <NA> a character <unk> but the neat thing about it is i can add control points <unk> and then what i can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time <unk> and you notice what it does
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 454.86 463.01 <NA> <unk> it 's kind of a puppeteering thing where i can use as many fingers as i have to draw
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 462.88 464.51 <NA> and make
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 469.81 475.08 <NA> now <unk> there 's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 480.29 492.72 <NA> <unk> technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here with multiple control points is actually state of the art it was released at siggraph last year it 's a great example of the kind of research i really love all this compute power to make things do the right things
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 492.72 496.05 <NA> intuitive things to do exactly what you expect <unk> 
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 498.71 500.05 <NA> so
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 500.25 504.13 <NA> <unk> interaction research is a very active field right now in hci i
JeffHan_2006 1 JeffHan_2006 503.88 515.53 <NA> 'm not the only one doing it a lot of other people are getting into it this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it i 'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields
