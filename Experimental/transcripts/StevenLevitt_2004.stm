StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1106.3 1110.67 <NA> when we over the data but what 's kind of interesting is that in this setting 
StevenLevitt_2004 1 StevenLevitt_2004 1110.47 1119.13 <NA> it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy in some sense because <unk> it 's unfettered capitalism
