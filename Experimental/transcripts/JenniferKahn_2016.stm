JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 12.82 17.9 <NA> <unk> so this is a talk about gene drives but i 'm going to start by telling you a brief story <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 18.1 26.55 <NA> twenty years ago a biologist named anthony james got obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos that didn 't transmit malaria
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 29.99 31.98 <NA> <unk> pretty much a complete failure 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 32.09 37.71 <NA> for one thing it turned out to be really hard to make a malaria resistant mosquito 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 37.82 46.89 <NA> james managed it finally just a few years ago <unk> by adding some genes that make it impossible for the malaria parasite to survive inside the mosquito <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 47.03 49.8 <NA> but that just created another problem 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 50 57.1 <NA> <unk> now that you 've got a malaria resistant mosquito how do you get it to replace all the malaria carrying mosquitos 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 57.6 68.2 <NA> there are a couple options <unk> but plan a was basically to breed up a bunch of the new genetically engineered mosquitos release them into the wild and hope that they pass on their genes 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 68.13 74.92 <NA> the problem was that you 'd have to release literally ten times the number of native mosquitos to work <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 74.61 78.47 <NA> so in a village with ten thousand mosquitos you release an extra
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 78.25 79.25 <NA> one hundred thousand
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 80.23 84.44 <NA> <unk> as you might guess this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 86.44 92.9 <NA> then last january <unk> anthony james got an email from a biologist named ethan bier 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 92.89 101.73 <NA> bier said that he and his grad student valentino gantz had stumbled on a tool that could not only guarantee that a particular genetic trait would be inherited <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 101.73 104.33 <NA> but that it would spread incredibly quickly 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 104.96 109.53 <NA> <unk> were right it would basically solve the problem that he and james had been working on for twenty years <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 109.97 118.89 <NA> as a test <unk> they engineered two mosquitos to carry the anti malaria gene and also this new tool a gene drive which i 'll explain in a minute <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 118.97 124.93 <NA> finally they set it up so that any mosquitos that had inherited the anti malaria gene wouldn 't have the usual white
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 125.49 132.49 <NA> <unk> but would instead have red eyes <unk> that was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 133.68 140.89 <NA> so they took their two anti malarial red eyed mosquitos and put them in a box with thirty ordinary white eyed ones <unk> and let them breed 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 140.88 145.72 <NA> in two generations <unk> those had produced three thousand eight hundred grandchildren 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 145.74 150.08 <NA> that is not the surprising part <unk> this is the surprising part
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 159.58 165.23 <NA> <unk> when james opened the box all three thousand eight hundred mosquitos had red eyes <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 164.8 171.26 <NA> when i asked ethan bier about this moment he became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 171.37 174.9 <NA> that 's because getting only red eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 180.26 185.46 <NA> <unk> genetics says when a male and a female mate their baby inherits half of its dna from each parent <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 185.03 193.32 <NA> so if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is ab where b is the anti malarial gene the babies should come out in four permutations <unk>
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 195.37 200.11 <NA> ba <unk> instead with the new gene drive <unk> they all came out
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 202.8 205.84 <NA> <unk> that shouldn 't even be possible so what happened 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 206.19 211.96 <NA> the first thing that happened was the arrival of a gene editing tool known as <unk> crispr in two thousand and twelve <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 212.19 221.08 <NA> many of you have probably heard about crispr so i 'll just say briefly that crispr is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely easily and quickly <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 221.04 229.73 <NA> it does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria basically there 's a protein that acts like a scissors and cuts the dna <unk> and there 's an rna molecule that
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 230.11 232.61 <NA> <unk> the scissors to any point on the genome you want 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 232.51 241.4 <NA> the result is basically a word processor for genes you can take an entire gene out put one in or even edit just a single letter within a gene 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 241.18 244.1 <NA> and you can do it in nearly any species <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 244.84 252.96 <NA> ok <unk> remember how i said that gene drives originally had two problems <unk> the first was that it was hard to engineer a mosquito
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 252.79 254.97 <NA> to be malaria resistant that 's basically
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 254.96 263.91 <NA> <unk> gone now thanks to crispr but the other problem was logistical how do you get your trait to spread this is where it gets clever 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 264.44 268.35 <NA> a couple years ago a biologist at harvard named kevin <unk>
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 267.86 276.9 <NA> <unk> esvelt wondered what would happen if you made it so that crispr inserted not only your new gene but also the machinery that does the cutting and pasting <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 276.74 279.97 <NA> in other words what if crispr also copied and pasted
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 280.01 285.67 <NA> itself you 'd end up with a perpetual motion machine for gene editing <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 285.99 291.92 <NA> and that 's exactly what happened <unk> this crispr gene drive that esvelt created
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 291.59 295.33 <NA> not only guarantees that a trait will get passed on 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 295.02 304.97 <NA> but if it 's used in the germline cells <unk> it will automatically copy and paste your new gene into both chromosomes of every single individual it 's like a global search and
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 304.93 309.83 <NA> <unk> replace or in science terms it makes a heterozygous trait homozygous <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 310.63 312.03 <NA> so 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 312.03 319.55 <NA> what does this mean for one thing it means we have a very powerful but also somewhat alarming new tool 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 320.08 325.19 <NA> up until now the fact that gene drives didn 't work very well was actually kind of a relief 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 324.94 329.97 <NA> normally when we mess around with an organism 's genes we make that thing less evolutionarily fit
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 330.07 338.01 <NA> <unk> so biologists can make all the mutant fruit flies they want without worrying about it if some escape <unk> natural selection just takes care of them 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 338.24 344.1 <NA> what 's remarkable and powerful and frightening about gene drives is that that will no longer be true <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 344.63 350.11 <NA> assuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap like a mosquito that can 't fly
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 351.48 357.7 <NA> <unk> gene drive will spread the change relentlessly until it is in every single individual in the population 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 358.59 363.97 <NA> now it isn 't easy to make a gene drive that works that well but james and <unk> esvelt think that we can 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 364.8 369.13 <NA> the good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 368.67 375.23 <NA> if you put an anti malarial gene drive in just one percent of anopheles mosquitoes the species that transmits malaria <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 375.23 379.34 <NA> researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 380.14 383 <NA> <unk> so in a year you could virtually eliminate malaria <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 382.99 389.81 <NA> in practice we 're still a few years out from being able to do that but still a one thousand children a day die of malaria <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 389.59 392.33 <NA> in a year that number could be almost zero 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 392.5 396.29 <NA> the same goes for dengue fever <unk> chikungunya <unk> yellow fever <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 396.73 400.02 <NA> and it gets better say you want to get rid of
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 401.66 409.11 <NA> <unk> get asian carp out of the great lakes all you have to do is release a gene drive that makes the fish produce only male offspring 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 408.86 413.34 <NA> in a few generations there 'll be no females left no more carp 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 413.12 417.96 <NA> in theory this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the brink 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 418.91 427.12 <NA> ok <unk> that 's the good news this is the bad news gene drives are so effective
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 426.96 429.97 <NA> that even an accidental release could change an entire

JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 432.69 443.92 <NA> anthony james took good precautions he bred his mosquitos in a bio containment lab and he also used a species that 's not native to the us so that even if some did escape <unk> they 'd just die off there 'd be nothing for them to mate with 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 443.94 449.99 <NA> but it 's also true that if a dozen asian carp with the all male gene drive accidentally got carried
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 450 456.59 <NA> from the great lakes back to asia they could potentially wipe out the native asian carp population <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 457.42 463.52 <NA> and that 's not so unlikely given how connected our world is in fact it 's why we have an invasive species problem <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 463.45 467.96 <NA> and that 's fish things like mosquitos and fruit flies 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 467.5 472.22 <NA> there 's literally no way to contain them they cross borders and oceans all the time <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 473.26 479.97 <NA> ok <unk> the other piece of bad news is that a gene drive might not stay confined to what we call the target species
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 480.16 485.76 <NA> that 's because of gene flow which is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species sometimes interbreed 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 485.36 491.31 <NA> if that happens it 's possible a gene drive could cross over like asian carp could infect some other kind of carp <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 491.12 499.99 <NA> that 's not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait like eye color <unk> in fact there 's a decent chance that we 'll see a wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 501.48 505.54 <NA> <unk> could be a disaster if your drive is deigned to eliminate the species entirely <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 505.83 513.34 <NA> the last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this to genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 513.12 516.61 <NA> is something that basically any lab in the world can do 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 516.48 518.74 <NA> an undergraduate can do it 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 518.7 522.76 <NA> a talented high schooler with some equipment can do it 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 530.8 536 <NA> <unk> nearly every scientist i talk to seemed to think that gene drives were not actually that frightening or dangerous <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 535.75 540.56 <NA> partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 541.45 550.11 <NA> so far that 's been true <unk> but gene drives also have some actual limitations so for one thing they work only in sexually reproducing species
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 551.57 553.92 <NA> <unk> be used to engineer viruses or bacteria 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 553.7 566.01 <NA> also the trait spreads only with each successive generation <unk> so changing or eliminating a population is practical only if that species has a fast reproductive cycle like insects or maybe small vertebrates like mice or fish <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 565.94 570.99 <NA> in elephants or people it would take centuries for a trait to spread widely enough to matter 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 571.58 579.88 <NA> also even with crispr it 's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating trait say you wanted to make a fruit fly that feeds
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 579.84 584.74 <NA> <unk> on ordinary fruit instead of rotting fruit with the aim of sabotaging american agriculture 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 584.61 592.36 <NA> first you 'd have to figure out which genes control what the fly wants to eat <unk> which is already a very long and complicated project <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 591.96 599.75 <NA> then you 'd have to alter those genes to change the fly 's behavior to whatever you 'd want it to be which is an even longer and more complicated project <unk>
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 600.49 603.83 <NA> <unk> might not even work because the genes that control behavior are complex <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 603.52 612.92 <NA> so if you 're a terrorist and have to choose between starting a grueling basic research program that will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out or just blowing stuff up 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 612.55 614.57 <NA> you 'll probably choose the later 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 615.01 620.78 <NA> this is especially true because at least in theory it should be pretty easy to build what 's called a reversal drive 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 620.59 629.49 <NA> that 's one that basically overwrites the change made by the first gene drive <unk> so if you don 't like the effects of a change you can just release a second drive that will cancel it out
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 629.99 631.17 <NA> <unk> least in theory <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 632.87 635.61 <NA> ok <unk> so where does this leave us

JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 655.08 664.12 <NA> at the same time some other very smart people are working hard to create safeguards like gene drives that self regulate or peter out after a few generations <unk>

JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 665.82 669.49 <NA> but this technology still requires a conversation <unk> 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 669.6 673.9 <NA> and given the nature of gene drives that conversation has to be global 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 673.62 679.97 <NA> what if kenya wants to use a drive but tanzania doesn 't who decides whether to release a gene drive that can fly

JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 682.39 690.25 <NA> i don 't have the answer to that question all we can do going forward i think is talk honestly about the risks and benefits

JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 693.28 700.19 <NA> by that i mean not just the choice to use a gene drive but also the choice not to use one 
JenniferKahn_2016 1 JenniferKahn_2016 700.63 704.94 <NA> humans have a tendency to assume that the safest option is to preserve the
