NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 384.49 394.49 <NA> so in the wise fifteen years ago we started out and said well wow there 's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that and our colleagues
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 394 399.9 <NA> in washington d c had recently published that when women
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 400.1 409.11 <NA> <unk> heart attacks and die compared to men who have heart attacks and die and again this is millions of people happening every day
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 409.01 416.13 <NA> women in their fatty plaque and this is their coronary artery so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 416.13 419.7 <NA> women erode men explode you
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 420.8 424.62 <NA> 're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 426.86 429.91 <NA> so i 'll describe the male pattern heart attack first
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 429.98 435.58 <NA> hollywood heart attack ughhhh horrible chest pain ekg goes pbbrrhh 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 435.39 444.73 <NA> so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg there 's a big clot in the middle of the artery <unk> and they go up to the cath lab and boom boom boom
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 444.72 454.67 <NA> get rid of the clot that 's a man heart attack some women have those heart attacks <unk> but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack where it erodes <unk> doesn 't completely fill with clot

NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 468.61 476.27 <NA> so we picked up on that and we said you know we now have the ability to look inside human beings
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 475.9 479.97 <NA> with these special catheters called ivus intravascular ultrasound
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 480.13 481.38 <NA> and we said we
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 481.67 490.95 <NA> 're going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different and deposited differently than men 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 490.49 499.75 <NA> and because of the the common knowledge of how women and men get fat when we watch people become
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 501.27 502.81 <NA> <unk> men get fat 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 503.4 511.93 <NA> right here <unk> it 's just a focal right there where do women get fat all over <unk> 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 512.34 521.27 <NA> cellulite here cellulite here <unk> so we said look women look like they 're pretty good about putting kind of the garbage away smoothly putting it away 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 521.27 524.81 <NA> men just have to dump it in a single area so we
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 526.99 529.79 <NA> <unk> so the yellow is the fatty plaque 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 529.36 536.43 <NA> and panel a is a man and you can see it 's lumpy bumpy he 's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 536.43 541.79 <NA> panel b is the woman very smooth she 's just laid it down nice and tidy laughter
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 542.56 552.06 <NA> and if you did that angiogram which is the red you can see the man 's disease so fifty years of honing and crafting these
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 555.07 561.36 <NA> disease <unk> kind of hard to see that female pattern disease so that was a discovery now
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 561.53 570.74 <NA> what are the implications of that well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem <unk> so we are working now on
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 570.74 575.11 <NA> a non invasive again these are all invasive studies ideally you would love
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 577.65 584.02 <NA> <unk> fifty years of good non invasive stress testing we 're pretty good at recognizing male pattern disease with stress tests <unk> 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 583.65 591.43 <NA> so this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging we 're doing this at the cedars sinai heart institute in the women 's heart center
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 591.21 592.76 <NA> <unk> we
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 592.31 602.2 <NA> selected this for the research this is not in your community hospital but we would hope to translate this and we 're about two and a half years into a five year study 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 601.77 604.97 <NA> this was the only modality that can see the
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 604.96 610.94 <NA> <unk> inner lining of the heart and if you look carefully you can see that there 's a black blush right there <unk> 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 610.54 615.08 <NA> and that is microvascular obstruction the syndrome the <unk>
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 616.11 620.48 <NA> now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction or obstruction 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 620.44 626.7 <NA> the second reason we really liked mri is that there 's no radiation so unlike the cat scans
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 629.8 639.97 <NA> whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation we say do we really need that test

NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 651.71 654.97 <NA> what are the downstream consequences then
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 656.61 658.09 <NA> <unk> heart disease
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 657.63 660.01 <NA> is not recognized

NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 681.55 684.56 <NA> <unk> so she looks like barbara in the movie

NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 710.06 723.33 <NA> there 's been wonderful news also about studying women <unk> finally in heart disease <unk> and one of the the cutting edge areas that we 're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy <unk> 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 722.93 729.94 <NA> if you ask what is the big difference between women and men physiologically why are there women

NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 732.84 741.82 <NA> bring new life into the world that 's all stem cells <unk> so we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better

NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 756.76 767.69 <NA> and if you had an injured organ if you had a heart attack and we wanted to repair that injured area do you want those robust plentiful stem cells on the top <unk> 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 767.8 769.64 <NA> or do you want
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 769.18 772.91 <NA> these guys that look like they 're out to lunch 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 774.19 779.97 <NA> and some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 780.2 785.85 <NA> <unk> stem cells and this is in animals and increasingly we 're showing this in humans
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 785.45 791.06 <NA> that female stem cells when put even into a male body <unk> do better
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 790.87 794.25 <NA> than male stem cells going into a male body 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 793.76 804.55 <NA> one of the things that we say about all of this female physiology because again as much as we 're talking about women and heart disease women do on average have better longevity than men
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 805.08 816.25 <NA> <unk> is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and and women <unk> so this is not a zero sum game in anyway okay
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 816.27 821.17 <NA> so here 's where we started <unk> and remember paths crossed in <unk>
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 822.32 829.04 <NA> and eighty four and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease what has happened in the last fifteen years with this work
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 829.93 831.77 <NA> <unk> we are bending the curve <unk>

NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 833.32 837.81 <NA> so just like the breast cancer story doing research 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 837.6 842.06 <NA> getting awareness going it works you just have to get it going 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 842.06 850.62 <NA> now are we happy with this we still have two to three more women dying for every man and i would propose with
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 850.38 852.42 <NA> the better longevity that women have
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 854.99 857.65 <NA> <unk> theoretically do better if we could just get treated <unk> 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 857.41 869.76 <NA> so this is where we are but we have a long row to hoe we 've worked on this for fifteen years and i 've told you we 've been working on male pattern heart disease for fifty years 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 869.75 874.96 <NA> so we 're thirty five years behind and we 'd like to think it 's not going to take thirty five years and
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 875.55 880.9 <NA> <unk> it probably won 't but we cannot stop now too many lives are at stake <unk> 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 880.98 888.4 <NA> so what do we need to do you now hopefully have a more personal relationship with your heart 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 888.39 896.18 <NA> women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 896.18 904.97 <NA> the women are very good about getting mammograms now and women do fundraising women participate they have put their money where their mouth
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 905.08 913.25 <NA> <unk> is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns this is what we need to do with heart disease now <unk> and it 's political 
NoelMerz_2011X 1 NoelMerz_2011X 912.94 920.6 <NA> women 's health from a federal funding standpoint <unk> sometimes it 's popular <unk> sometimes it 's not so popular <unk>
