DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 17.2 29.94 <NA> i 've been working with plastic bags which i cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last twenty years <unk> i turn them into two and three dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 30.38 39.6 <NA> upon working with the plastic after about the first eight years some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 39.53 44.28 <NA> and i thought great it 's ephemeral just like us 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 44.6 50.05 <NA> upon educating myself a little further about plastics i actually realized this was a
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 51.15 56.15 <NA> <unk> 's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits because it 's always still plastic 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 56.15 65.38 <NA> and what we 're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment i then in the last few years learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 65.37 70.96 <NA> and my initial reaction and i think this is a lot of people 's first reaction to learning about it is 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 70.96 75.13 <NA> oh my god we 've got to go out there and clean this thing up 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 74.85 79.91 <NA> so i actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 79.84 82.89 <NA> <unk> decommissioned fishing trawlers a crane 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 82.65 85.78 <NA> a chipping machine and a cold molding machine 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 85.79 99.47 <NA> and my intention was to go out to the gyre raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic <unk> chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 102.77 109.2 <NA> <unk> i began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 108.95 111.69 <NA> and upon doing so
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 111.47 121.59 <NA> i realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world <unk> 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 121.37 127.39 <NA> and that actually i needed to back up and look at the bigger picture and the bigger picture is we need to find a way
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 127.22 129.94 <NA> to turn off the faucet we need to
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 130.07 138.1 <NA> cut the spigot of single use and disposable plastics <unk> which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 137.73 150.02 <NA> so in looking at that i also realized that i was really angry <unk> i wasn 't just concerned about plastic that you 're trying to imagine out in the middle of the pacific ocean of which i have learned there are now eleven gyres potentially of
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 150 152.93 <NA> plastic in five major oceans in the world it
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 152.62 158.18 <NA> 's not just that gyre of plastic that i 'm concerned about it 's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 158.18 165.53 <NA> i 'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic all of my beverages are packaged in plastic even at the health food market 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 165.61 175.01 <NA> i 'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator <unk> and i 'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies <unk> 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 174.7 179.76 <NA> so i came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue and we created the
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 180.17 181.95 <NA> <unk> pollution coalition 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 181.67 186.34 <NA> we have many initiatives that we 're working on <unk> but some of them are very basic 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 186.13 187.61 <NA> one is 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 187.62 197.79 <NA> if eighty to ninety percent of what we 're finding in the ocean of the marine debris that we 're finding in the ocean is plastic then why don 't we call it what it is it 's plastic pollution 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 197.51 199.18 <NA> recycling
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 199 204.79 <NA> everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling you put
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 205.05 207.32 <NA> <unk> in a bin and you don 't have to think about it again 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 207.14 216.4 <NA> what is the reality of that in the united states <unk> less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled and if you really look into it particularly when it comes to plastic bottles <unk> 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 216.4 224.05 <NA> most of it is only down cycled or incinerated or shipped to china it is down cycled and turned into lesser things <unk> 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 223.56 227.63 <NA> while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or

DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 231.55 234.5 <NA> so this is a big issue for us <unk> 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 234.01 244.26 <NA> another thing that we 're looking at and asking people to think about is we 've added a fourth r onto the front of the reduce reuse recycle three r 's <unk> 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 244.21 254.85 <NA> <unk> and that is refuse <unk> whenever possible <unk> refuse single use and disposable plastics alternatives exist some of them are very <unk> old school i myself am now collecting these
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 254.81 257.92 <NA> <unk> cool pyrex containers and using those instead of

DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 263.81 274.81 <NA> 's very easy to pick up a stainless steel bottle or a glass bottle if you 're traveling and you 've forgotten to bring your <unk> stainless steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water <unk> versus purchasing

DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 276.27 287.57 <NA> i guess what i want to say to everybody here and i know that you guys know a lot about this issue is that this is a huge problem in the oceans <unk> but this is a problem that we 've created as consumers and we can solve 
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 287.57 290.69 <NA> we can solve this by raising awareness of the issue
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 290.53 302.12 <NA> and teaching people to choose alternatives so whenever possible to choose alternatives to single use plastics we can cut the stem tide the stem of this into our oceans
DiannaCohen_2010Z 1 DiannaCohen_2010Z 301.94 307.04 <NA> and in doing so save our oceans <unk> save our planet save ourselves
