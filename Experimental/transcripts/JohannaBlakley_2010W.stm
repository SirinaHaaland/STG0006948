JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 23.74 29.94 <NA> i 'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love or love to hate
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 30.02 37.62 <NA> are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender <unk> 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 37.31 41.86 <NA> i think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 41.68 49.96 <NA> some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender <unk> if you
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 51.12 59.23 <NA> <unk> our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender and i think that 's going to change <unk> 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 58.89 64.55 <NA> now most media companies television radio <unk> publishing games you name it
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 64.07 71.65 <NA> they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences it 's old school demographics 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 71.16 75.17 <NA> they come up with these very restrictive labels to define us
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 76.21 77.66 <NA> <unk> now the crazy thing
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 77.46 89.49 <NA> is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways you have certain taste that you like certain things <unk> 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 89.49 93.75 <NA> and so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 93.57 97.55 <NA> is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 98.56 100.41 <NA> age demographics

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 110.96 123.54 <NA> now they 've aged out of that demographic but it 's still the case that powerful ratings companies like nielson don 't even take into account viewers of television shows over age fifty four 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 123.54 127.8 <NA> in our media environment it 's as if they don 't even exist <unk>

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 142.1 148.84 <NA> but psychographics really haven 't had a huge impact on the media business it 's really just been basic demographics <unk> 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 149.19 154.82 <NA> so i 'm at the norman lear center at usc and we 've done a lot of research over the last seven

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 179.9 187.74 <NA> <unk> categories mean even less now than they did before <unk> because with online networking tools it 's much easier for us to
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 187.51 190.43 <NA> escape some of our demographic boxes we
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 190.44 198.87 <NA> 're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online and we can lie about our age online too pretty easily

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 204.93 206.72 <NA> <unk> we don 't need a media company
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 206.54 217.43 <NA> to help do this for us so the traditional media companies of course are paying very close attention to these online communities they know this is the mass audience of the future 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 217.43 227.65 <NA> they need to figure it out but they 're having a hard time doing it because they 're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them <unk> because that 's how ad rates are still determined <unk> 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 227.16 229.76 <NA> when they 're monitoring your clickstream

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 237.47 248.81 <NA> but they get a lot more information about what you do online what you like what interests you that 's easier for them to find out than who you are and even though that 's still sort of creepy
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 250.16 260.79 <NA> <unk> there is an upside to having your taste monitored suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn 't been before <unk> it had been presumed before <unk> 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 261.2 268.18 <NA> so when you look online at the way people aggregate they don 't aggregate around age gender and income <unk> 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 268.18 279.43 <NA> they aggregate around the things they love the things that they like <unk> and if you think about it shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 279.84 289.33 <NA> <unk> i 'd much rather know whether you like buffy the vampire slayer rather than how old you are that would tell me something more substantial about you 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 289.65 294.58 <NA> now there 's something else that we 've discovered about social media that 's actually quite surprising

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 312.61 317.36 <NA> and then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 323.38 329.85 <NA> on old media the question is what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 329.89 332.04 <NA> and what 's it going to mean for women

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 364.83 368.41 <NA> well i actually don 't think that 's going to be the case 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 368.13 378.59 <NA> i think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women because they realize this is important for their business and i think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 379.9 385.5 <NA> <unk> think women are actually going to be ironically enough responsible for driving a stake through the heart
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 385.26 394.43 <NA> of cheesy genre categories like the chick flick and all these other genre categories that presume
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 394.43 399.99 <NA> that certain demographic groups like certain things that hispanics like certain
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 400.31 404.7 <NA> <unk> that young people like certain things this is far too simplistic 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 404.21 417.48 <NA> the future entertainment media that we 're going to see is going to be very data driven and it 's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online <unk> where women are really driving the action 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 417.11 421.36 <NA> so you may be asking well why is it important that i know
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 421.12 429.94 <NA> what entertains people why should i know this of course <unk> old media companies and advertisers need to know this but my argument is
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 429.9 440.53 <NA> <unk> that if you want to understand the global village it 's probably a good idea that you figure out what they 're passionate about what amuses them what they choose to do in their free time <unk>
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 440.48 446.06 <NA> this is a very important thing to know about people i 've spent most of my professional life

JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 452.71 455.12 <NA> though actually it is really fun
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 454.72 459.35 <NA> but also because our research has shown over and over again
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 459.15 467.9 <NA> that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people 's lives for instance on their political beliefs and on their health <unk> 
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 467.9 475.23 <NA> and so if you have any interest in understanding the world looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start
JohannaBlakley_2010W 1 JohannaBlakley_2010W 478.19 488.34 <NA> <unk> a media atmosphere that isn 't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics can you even imagine what that looks like
