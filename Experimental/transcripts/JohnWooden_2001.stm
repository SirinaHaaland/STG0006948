JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 914.88 924.71 <NA> keith wilkes and let it go at that he had the qualifications not the only one but he was one that i used in that particular category because i think he
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 924.71 929.52 <NA> he made the effort to become the best there was a couple i mention in my book they call me coach
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 930.44 940.62 <NA> two players that gave me great satisfaction that came as close as i think anyone i ever had to reach their full potential one was conrad burke <unk> and one was doug mcintosh when i saw them
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 940.19 946.53 <NA> as freshmen on our freshmen team freshmen couldn 't play varsity when i taught <unk> 
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 946.16 953.86 <NA> i thought oh gracious if these two players either one of them they were different years but i thought about each one at the time he was there oh if he ever makes
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 954.9 963.34 <NA> <unk> our varsity must be pretty miserable <unk> if he 's good enough to make it and you know one of them was a starting player for a
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 963.27 965.83 <NA> season and a half the other one 
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 965.34 973.22 <NA> his next year played thirty two minutes in a national championship game did a tremendous job for us the next year he was a starting
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 973.06 975.02 <NA> a starting player on the national championship
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 975.13 981.56 <NA> <unk> and here i thought he 'd never play a minute <unk> when he was so those are the things that give you
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 981.4 987.95 <NA> great joy <unk> and great satisfaction to see neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well <unk> 
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 987.67 992.39 <NA> but they had outstanding shooting percentages because they didn 't force it <unk> 
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 992.14 995.33 <NA> and neither one could jump very well
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 994.84 999.92 <NA> but they kept good position <unk> and so they did well rebounding they remembered that
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 999.49 1004.97 <NA> that every shot that 's taken they assumed would be missed i 've had too many stand around and wait to see if it 's missed
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1005.01 1014.06 <NA> <unk> then they go and it 's too late somebody else is in there ahead <unk> of them they weren 't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1013.63 1019.82 <NA> and so they they played pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that they came close to
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1019.48 1027.78 <NA> as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had so i consider them to be as successful as
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1030.02 1036.33 <NA> <unk> or bill walton <unk> or many of the others that we had there were some outstanding
JohnWooden_2001 1 JohnWooden_2001 1036.17 1043.18 <NA> players have i rambled enough i was told that when he makes his appearance
