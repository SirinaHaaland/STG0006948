SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 467.41 472.31 <NA> so it turns out the two species were interdependent like yin and yang

SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 520.23 524.96 <NA> well as forest scientists we have to do our research in the forests and that 's really tough as i 've shown
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 526.12 529.97 <NA> <unk> we have to be really good at running from bears

SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 563.15 568.11 <NA> well it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon

SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 862 866.73 <NA> well i want to take a check on that thirty years later here in western canada 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 874.4 879.64 <NA> this is about one hundred kilometers to the west of us just on the border of banff national park
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 880.65 884.74 <NA> that 's a lot of clear cuts it 's not so pristine 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 885.45 895.06 <NA> in two thousand and fourteen the world resources institute reported that canada in the past decade has had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 895.08 897.7 <NA> and i bet you thought it was brazil 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 898.62 904.94 <NA> in canada it 's three point six percent per year now by my estimation that 's about four times
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 905.02 906.95 <NA> <unk> rate that is sustainable 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 908.5 921.71 <NA> now massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles degrade wildlife habitat <unk> and emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere <unk> which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 922.75 929.97 <NA> not only that we 're continuing to plant one or two species and weed out the aspens and birches these simplified
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 929.99 934.99 <NA> <unk> forests lack complexity and they 're really vulnerable to infections and bugs <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 934.99 939.9 <NA> and as climate changes this is creating a perfect storm
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 940.82 948.12 <NA> for extreme events like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak that just swept across north america <unk> or that <unk>
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 952.83 955.69 <NA> <unk> so i want to come back to my final question <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 956.4 962.86 <NA> instead of weakening our forests <unk> how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change well
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 963.15 971.2 <NA> you know the great thing about forests as complex systems is they have enormous capacity to self heal 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 971.1 979.97 <NA> in our recent experiments we found with <unk> patch cutting and retention of hub trees and regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 980.4 984.98 <NA> that these mycorrhizal networks <unk> they recover really rapidly 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 985.33 993.92 <NA> so with this in mind i want to leave you with four simple solutions <unk> and we can 't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 994.6 998.78 <NA> first we all need to get out in the forest <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 998.95 1004.88 <NA> we need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests <unk> you see most of our
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1004.81 1006.59 <NA> <unk> forests now are managed using a <unk>
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1007.51 1013.67 <NA> <unk> approach <unk> but good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1013.93 1018.56 <NA> second <unk> we need to save our old growth forests <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1018.49 1025.1 <NA> these are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1026.02 1029.94 <NA> so this means less cutting <unk> i don 't mean no cutting but
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1029.9 1031.17 <NA> <unk> less cutting <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1031.43 1037.08 <NA> and third <unk> when we do cut <unk> we need to save the legacies <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1036.65 1048.39 <NA> the mother trees and networks <unk> and the wood <unk> the genes so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road <unk> 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1048.11 1051.06 <NA> we need to be conservationists 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1051.29 1054.49 <NA> and finally <unk> fourthly and finally
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1055.23 1064.3 <NA> <unk> we need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species and genotypes and structures by planting and allowing natural regeneration 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1064.05 1070.75 <NA> we have to give mother nature the tools she needs to use her intelligence to self heal 
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1070.62 1075.26 <NA> and we need to remember that forests aren 't just a bunch of trees competing with each other
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1079.89 1083.39 <NA> jigs 's fall into the outhouse showed me
SuzanneSimard_2016T 1 SuzanneSimard_2016T 1082.93 1091.38 <NA> this other world <unk> and it changed my view of forests <unk> i hope today to have changed how you think about forests <unk> thank you
