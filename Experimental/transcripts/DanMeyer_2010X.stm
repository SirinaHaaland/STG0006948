DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 245.91 253.62 <NA> we 're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit <unk> and if the student still doesn 't recognize the stamp this was molded from it helpfully explains

DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 265.13 277.32 <NA> so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math here 's a really cool problem i like this it 's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift but what you have here is actually four separate layers and i 'm curious
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 276.83 279.46 <NA> which of you can see the four separate layers and
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 280.37 286.9 <NA> how when they 're compressed together and presented to the student all at once how that creates this impatient problem solving i
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 286.47 288.89 <NA> 'll define them here <unk> you have the visual
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 288.89 300.49 <NA> <unk> you also have the mathematical structure <unk> talking about grids measurements labels points <unk> axes that sort of thing you have substeps which all lead to what we really want to talk about which section is the steepest <unk> 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 300.39 304.91 <NA> so i hope you can see i really hope you can see how what we 're doing here is taking a compelling
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 304.84 315.53 <NA> <unk> question a compelling answer but we 're paving a smooth <unk> straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way that 's all we 're doing here 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 315.82 324.9 <NA> so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students we can have everything we 're looking for in terms of patient problem solving so right here i start with the
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 325.34 337.95 <NA> <unk> and i immediately ask the question which section is the steepest <unk> and this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers so you get people arguing against each other friend versus friend

DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 340.21 353.79 <NA> and then eventually we realize it <unk> it 's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a b c and d labels to talk about them more easily <unk> 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 354.9 365.96 <NA> <unk> as we start to define what what does steepness mean we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down specifically what that means <unk> and then and only then we throw down that mathematical structure 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 365.96 370.12 <NA> the math serves the conversation the conversation doesn 't serve the math and
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 370.29 374.9 <NA> at that point i 'll put it to you that nine out of ten classes are good to go on the whole slope steepness
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 375.34 379.37 <NA> <unk> but if you need to your students can then develop those substeps together 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 379 387.44 <NA> do you guys see how this right here compared to that which one creates that patient problem solving that math reasoning <unk> it 's been obvious in my practice to me 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 387.31 391.52 <NA> and i 'll yield the floor here for a second to einstein who i believe has paid his dues 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 391.51 402.17 <NA> he talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important <unk> and yet in my practice <unk> in the u s here <unk> we just give problems to students we don 't involve them in the formulation of the problem 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 402.46 404.88 <NA> so ninety percent of what i
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 405.28 415.8 <NA> with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving <unk>
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 415.75 421.32 <NA> and here 's how it works <unk> i like this question <unk> it 's about a water tank the question is how long will it take you to fill it up <unk> 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 425.34 435.49 <NA> <unk> they have to formulate those <unk> and then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you 'll need none of it 's a distractor so we lose that students need to decide all right well does the height matter <unk> does <unk>
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 435.39 441.8 <NA> <unk> the side of it matter <unk> does the color of the valve matter what matters here such an underrepresented question in math curriculum 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 455.28 457.94 <NA> in textbooks we go out and we take a picture of it 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 457.9 461.93 <NA> so now we have the real deal how long will it take it to fill it up <unk> 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 461.74 467.06 <NA> and then even better is we take a video a video of someone filling it up 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 467.06 475.11 <NA> and it 's filling up slowly agonizingly slowly it 's tedious students are looking at their watches rolling their eyes <unk> and they 're all wondering at some point
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 484.07 486.81 <NA> <unk> how you know you 've baited the hook right
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 488.18 496.38 <NA> <unk> and that question off this right here is really fun for me because like the intro i teach kids because of my inexperience i teach the kids <unk>
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 496.28 502.36 <NA> <unk> that are the most remedial all right <unk> and i 've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 504.9 511.66 <NA> <unk> formula better than me <unk> so i won 't talk about it but here <unk> every student is on a level playing field of intuition
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 511.17 523.54 <NA> everyone 's filled something up with water before <unk> so i get kids answering the question how long will it take i 've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation we put names on the board <unk> 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 523.08 525.16 <NA> attach them to guesses
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 524.67 529.94 <NA> and kids have bought in here <unk> and then we follow the process i 've described <unk> and the best part here
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 530.08 538.34 <NA> or one of the better parts is that we don 't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher 's edition we instead just watch the end of the movie 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 539.59 547.68 <NA> and that 's terrifying because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher 's edition <unk> that 's great but
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 547.68 554.88 <NA> it 's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical but those conversations have been so valuable among the
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 554.84 563.86 <NA> <unk> most valuable <unk> so i 'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre installed with these viruses day one of the class <unk> these are the kids who
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 563.86 575.13 <NA> <unk> who now one semester in i can put something on the board <unk> totally new <unk> totally foreign <unk> and they 'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year which is just so fun
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 575.58 580.69 <NA> <unk> 're no longer averse to word problems because we 've redefined what a word problem is 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 580.5 586.93 <NA> we 're no longer intimidated by math because we 're slowly redefining what math is this has been a lot of fun <unk> 
DanMeyer_2010X 1 DanMeyer_2010X 586.44 594.4 <NA> i encourage math teachers i talk to to use multimedia because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color
