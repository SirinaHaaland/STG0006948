JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 293.01 301.09 <NA> power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want and you can do it in three ways

JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 343.24 350.05 <NA> was primarily in terms of military power <unk> for example the great oxford historian who taught here
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 352.59 354.72 <NA> <unk> defined a great power

JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 358.44 367.66 <NA> but we need a new narrative if we 're to understand power in the 21st century it 's not just prevailing at war though war still persists <unk> 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 367.35 376.19 <NA> it 's not whose army wins <unk> it 's also whose story wins <unk> and we have to think much more in terms of narratives
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 376.03 378.65 <NA> and whose narrative is going to be effective
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 380.2 385.58 <NA> <unk> now let me go back to the question of power
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 385.45 392.36 <NA> transition between states and what 's happening there the narratives that we use now
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 392.19 396.09 <NA> tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 396.09 402.59 <NA> and the current narrative is all about the rise of china and the decline of the united states
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 402.1 404.97 <NA> indeed with the two thousand and eight financial
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 404.96 413.19 <NA> <unk> crisis many people said this was the beginning of the end of american power the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting

JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 421.61 426.31 <NA> but in fact this metaphor of decline
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 426.1 429.97 <NA> is often very misleading if you look at history
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 430.01 439.18 <NA> in recent history you 'll see the cycles of belief in american decline come and go every ten or fifteen years or so in <unk>

JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 483.17 490.96 <NA> the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 490.75 500.22 <NA> than they do about reality <unk> if we try to focus on the reality <unk> then what we need to focus on is what 's really happening

JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 605.2 610.22 <NA> <unk> and also when we think about the rise of asia or return of asia as i
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 609.85 612.23 <NA> called it a little bit earlier it 's
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 612.1 615.5 <NA> worth remembering asia 's not one thing <unk>

JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 905.01 909.67 <NA> and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 909.67 918.51 <NA> that 's good for us as well as good for china as well as good for everybody else <unk> so empowering china to deal with its own
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 918.33 924.93 <NA> problems of carbon is good for everybody and it 's not a zero sum i win
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 925.55 928.17 <NA> <unk> 's one in which we can all gain <unk> 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 927.95 931.95 <NA> so as we think about power in this century <unk> 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 931.7 937.32 <NA> we want to get away from this view that it 's all i win you lose <unk> 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 937.32 944.61 <NA> now i don 't mean to be pollyannaish about this <unk> wars persist power persists military power is important <unk> 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 944.18 950.23 <NA> keeping balances is important all this still persists <unk> hard power is there
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 950.22 951.82 <NA> <unk> and it will remain 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 951.54 963.55 <NA> but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that i call smart power <unk> you 're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we 're facing <unk> 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 963.45 967.7 <NA> so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 967.5 975.08 <NA> is how do we work together to produce global public goods <unk> things from which all of us can benefit 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 975.01 980.99 <NA> <unk> how do we define our national interests so that it 's not just zero sum but positive sum 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 980.65 990.87 <NA> in that sense if we define our interests for example for the united states the way britain defined its interests in the <unk> 19th century <unk> keeping an open trading system <unk> 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 990.87 998.24 <NA> keeping a monetary stability <unk> keeping freedom of the seas those were good for britain they were good for others as well 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 997.84 1004.97 <NA> and in the 21st century you have to do an analog to that how do we produce global public goods which are good for us
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1005.25 1017.7 <NA> but good for everyone at the same time and that 's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the 21st century <unk> there are ways to define our interests
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1017.49 1024.09 <NA> in which while protecting ourselves with hard power we can organize with others in networks
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1024.09 1029.46 <NA> to produce not only public goods <unk> but ways that will enhance our soft power
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1030.29 1031.34 <NA> <unk> so
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1030.97 1041.49 <NA> if one looks at the statements that have been made about this i am impressed that when hillary clinton described the foreign policy of the obama administration 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1041.49 1047.4 <NA> she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1047 1052.65 <NA> as she put it using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1052.46 1054.85 <NA> and if we 're going to deal with these two
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1054.78 1057.73 <NA> <unk> great power shifts that i 've described 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1057.57 1066.26 <NA> the power shift represented by transition among states the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1066.02 1075.13 <NA> we 're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power <unk> 
JosephNye_2010G 1 JosephNye_2010G 1075.13 1079.4 <NA> and that 's the good news i have we can do that thank you very much
