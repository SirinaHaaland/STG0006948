GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 13.09 21.95 <NA> <unk> i love to collect things <unk> ever since i was a kid i 've had massive collections of random stuff everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 21.91 24.75 <NA> to insects that i 've captured and put in jars
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 26.24 32.76 <NA> <unk> 's no secret because i like collecting things that i love the natural history museum and the collections of animals at the natural history museum in dioramas 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 32.3 39.54 <NA> these to me are like living sculptures right <unk> that you can go and look at and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal 's life <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 39.17 44.64 <NA> so i was thinking about my own life <unk> and how i 'd like to memorialize my life you know for the ages <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 44.3 49.51 <NA> and also the lives of my friends <unk> but
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 49.3 52.24 <NA> the problem with this is that my friends aren 't quite keen on the idea of me
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 55.23 64.78 <NA> <unk> so instead i turned to video and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time <unk> so what i did was i filmed six of my friends
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 64.5 72.43 <NA> and then using video mapping and video projection i created a video sculpture <unk> which was these six friends projected into jars 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 73.11 79.82 <NA> so now i have this collection of my friends i can take around with me whenever i go and this is called animalia chordata from the latin nomenclature for
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 80.02 88.01 <NA> <unk> being classification system <unk> so this piece memorializes my friends in these jars <unk> and they actually move around 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 88.93 94.43 <NA> laughter so this is interesting to me but it lacked a certain human element it
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 95.5 103.89 <NA> 's a digital sculpture so i wanted to add an interaction system so what i did was i added a proximity sensor <unk> so that when you get close to the people in jars <unk> they react to you in different ways you know 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 103.89 104.97 <NA> just like people on the street when
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 104.93 114.12 <NA> <unk> get too close to them <unk> some people reacted in terror others reacted in asking you for help <unk> and some people hide from you 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 114.56 121.17 <NA> so this was really interesting to me this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life <unk> and also adding interactivity to sculpture
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 120.74 124.93 <NA> <unk> so over the next year <unk> i documented forty of my other
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 125 130.78 <NA> friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as garden which is literally a garden of humanity <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 131.19 141.8 <NA> but something about the first piece the animali chordata piece kept coming back to me this idea of interaction with art <unk> and i really liked the idea of people being able to interact and also being challenged by interacting with art <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 141.8 149.26 <NA> so i wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something and the way i did this was actually by projecting a 1950s housewife into a blender 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 151.08 154.85 <NA> this is a piece called blend <unk> and what it does is it actually makes you
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 154.78 158.16 <NA> <unk> implicit in the work of art you may never experience the entire thing yourself 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 158.16 165.14 <NA> you can walk away you can just watch as this as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you or you can actually choose to interact with it
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 165.34 169.19 <NA> <unk> so if you do choose to interact with the with the piece 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 169.33 175.28 <NA> and you press the blender button it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 175.51 179.7 <NA> by doing that you are now part of my piece you like the people that are trapped in my work
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 183.74 186.12 <NA> have become part of my work as well 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 194.96 196.32 <NA> but 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 196.01 197.31 <NA> but
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 197.87 204.82 <NA> this seems a bit unfair right <unk> i put my friends in jars i put this this character this sort of endangered species character in a blender
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 205.11 218.51 <NA> <unk> but i 'd never done anything about myself i 'd never really memorialized myself so i decided to create a piece which is a self portrait piece this is sort of a self portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called a point just passed in which i project myself on top of a time card punch clock <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 218.51 223.06 <NA> and it 's up to you if you want to choose to punch that punch card clock <unk> you actually age me <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 222.57 224.62 <NA> so i start as a baby <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 224.64 229.94 <NA> and then if you punch the clock <unk> you 'll actually transform the baby into a toddler
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 229.98 239.78 <NA> <unk> and then from a toddler i 'm transformed into a teenager <unk> from a teenager i 'm transformed into my current self <unk> from my current self i 'm turned into a middle aged man <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 239.68 243.05 <NA> and then from there into an elderly man <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 243.73 249.93 <NA> and if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day <unk> the piece goes black and is not to be
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 250 251.55 <NA> <unk> reset until the next day <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 251.69 254.46 <NA> so in doing so you 're erasing time 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 254.24 257.91 <NA> you 're actually implicit in this work and you 're erasing my life <unk> 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 257.63 267.04 <NA> so i like this about interactive video sculpture <unk> that you can actually interact with it that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves <unk> and hopefully one day 
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 1 GabrielBarciaColombo_2012 267.04 269.53 <NA> i 'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars
