ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 14.53 18.77 <NA> <unk> the study of fishes it looks like a big <unk> boring word 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 18.76 24.99 <NA> but it 's actually quite exciting because ichthyology is the only ology with yolo
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 27.53 33.23 <NA> <unk> to the cool kids in the audience you already know yolo stands for you only live once 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 33.24 42.33 <NA> and because i only have one life i 'm going to spend it doing what i always dreamt of doing seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species <unk> and that 's what i get to do <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 42.41 50.43 <NA> now in recent years i really focused on caves for finding new species <unk> and it turns out there 's lots of new cavefish species out there 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 50.43 52.36 <NA> you just have to know where to look 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 52.15 54.22 <NA> and to maybe be a little thin
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 55.56 59.99 <NA> <unk> now cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 59.99 66.34 <NA> they can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved by being stuck in these little holes <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 66 70.48 <NA> and they can tell me about the evolution of sight <unk> by being blind 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 70.68 75.23 <NA> now fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours all vertebrates
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 75.88 80.6 <NA> <unk> and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark cold cave environment 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 80.6 87.77 <NA> over many many generations they lose their eyes and their eyesight until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 87.4 91.58 <NA> now <unk> each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 91.58 98.72 <NA> and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us <unk> and that 's why it 's so exciting when we find a new species 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 98.74 100.02 <NA> so this is a new
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 107.87 117.39 <NA> <unk> its closest relatives are cavefishes in kentucky in the mammoth cave system and they start to diverge when the ohio river split them a few million years ago <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 116.9 123.27 <NA> and in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 122.78 128.74 <NA> there 's this gene called rhodopsin that 's super critical for sight we have it and these species have it too
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 129.78 134.05 <NA> <unk> species has lost all function in that gene and the other one maintains it 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 133.74 144.25 <NA> so this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision and at the very roots of how we can see <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 144.54 150.05 <NA> but the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time maybe no
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 150.04 155.61 <NA> <unk> more so than in this species here this is a new species we described from madagascar that we named
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 157.84 164.39 <NA> that means big sickness in malagasy for how sick we got trying to collect this species <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 164.14 172.89 <NA> now <unk> believe it or not <unk> swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop isn 't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 180.28 182.88 <NA> despite the fact that it tried to kill us <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 182.63 190.5 <NA> and that 's because this species in madagascar its closest relatives are six thousand kilometers away cavefishes in australia 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 190.19 196.29 <NA> now there 's no way a three inch long freshwater cavefish can swim across the indian ocean 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 195.89 204.76 <NA> so what we found when we compared the dna of these species is that they 've been separated for more than one hundred million years <unk> or about the time that the southern continents
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 204.93 207.22 <NA> <unk> southern continents were last together 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 207.36 211.39 <NA> so in fact these species didn 't move at all it 's the continents that moved them 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 211.39 220.06 <NA> and so they give us through their dna this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 220.53 224.9 <NA> now this species here is so new i 'm not even allowed to tell you its name
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 225.88 230.6 <NA> <unk> can tell you it 's a new species from mexico <unk> and it 's probably already extinct 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 230.2 236.45 <NA> it 's probably extinct because the only known cave system it 's from was destroyed when a dam was built nearby <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 236.17 242.69 <NA> unfortunately for cavefishes their groundwater habitat is also our main source of drinking water <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 242.62 250.02 <NA> now <unk> we actually don 't know this species ' closest relative yet it doesn 't appear to be anything else in mexico
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 250.4 254.61 <NA> <unk> so maybe it 's something in cuba <unk> or florida <unk> or india <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 254.27 264.66 <NA> but whatever it is it might tell us something new about the geology of the caribbean or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blindness <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 264.2 268.5 <NA> but i hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too <unk> 
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 268.25 276.81 <NA> and i 'm going to spend my one life as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cavefishes
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 276.32 280.2 <NA> that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet
ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 1 ProsantaChakrabarty_2016U 279.8 283.03 <NA> and the biology of how we see <unk> thank you
