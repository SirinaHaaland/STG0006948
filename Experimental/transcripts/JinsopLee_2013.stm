JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 123.61 127.26 <NA> this problem 's been bugging me for well over a decade all
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 127.61 129.97 <NA> right let 's get back to the question of why sex
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 130.23 134.15 <NA> <unk> is so good <unk> many years after the solar powered clocks project 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 134.15 142.39 <NA> a young lady i knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses <unk> and when she said this i had an epiphany <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 141.99 148.6 <NA> so i decided to evaluate different experiences i had in my life from the point of view of the five senses <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 148.6 152.47 <NA> to do this <unk> i devised something called the five senses graph 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 152.19 154.97 <NA> along the y axis you have a scale from zero
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 154.9 158.87 <NA> <unk> to ten <unk> and along the x axis you have of course <unk> the five senses <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 158.44 165.23 <NA> anytime i had a memorable experience in my life <unk> i would record it on this graph like a five senses diary here
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 165.13 167.94 <NA> 's a quick video to show you how it works
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 241.51 249.99 <NA> <unk> and that 's how the five senses graph works now for a period of three years i gathered data <unk> not just me but also some of my friends 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 250.46 257.58 <NA> <unk> i used to teach in university so i forced my i mean i asked my students to do this as well so here are some other results 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 257.57 264.21 <NA> the first is for instant noodles now obviously taste and smell are quite high <unk> but
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 263.81 267.12 <NA> notice sound is at three 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 266.99 276.85 <NA> many people told me a big part of the noodle eating experience is the slurping noise <unk> you know needless to say i no longer dine with these people
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 280.32 288.01 <NA> here what i found interesting was that taste is at four and many respondents told me
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 287.76 296.92 <NA> it 's because of the taste of drinks but also in some cases kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience these people i still do hang out with all right 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 297.12 304.76 <NA> and smoking <unk> here i found touch is at [ six ] and one of the reasons is that
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 304.75 313.95 <NA> <unk> smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience which shows it 's kind of scary to think
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 313.77 318.11 <NA> how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers ok 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 317.77 324.87 <NA> now what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph it would of course be a horizontal
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 325.13 332.46 <NA> <unk> along the top now you can see not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close in fact <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 332.09 339.48 <NA> in the years that i gathered data only one experience came close to being the perfect one that is of course sex 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 339.02 346.29 <NA> great sex respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level here
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 345.83 351.48 <NA> i 'll quote one of my students who said sex is so good <unk> it 's good even when it 's bad 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 351.74 354.97 <NA> so the five senses theory does
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 354.96 358.06 <NA> <unk> help explain why sex is so good <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 357.75 360.68 <NA> now in the middle of all this five senses work <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 360.68 369.59 <NA> i suddenly remembered the solar powered clocks project from my youth and i realized this theory also explains why chris 's clock is so much better than mine <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 369.38 374.8 <NA> you see my clock only focuses on sight <unk> and a little bit of touch <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 374.49 376.75 <NA> here 's chris 's clock 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 377.01 379.97 <NA> it 's the first clock ever that uses
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 379.93 386.48 <NA> <unk> smell to tell the time in fact in terms of the five senses <unk> chris 's clock is a revolution <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 386.44 399.26 <NA> and that 's what this theory taught me about my field you see up till now us designers we 've mainly focused on making things look very pretty <unk> and a little bit of touch <unk> which means we 've ignored the other three senses 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 398.98 404.94 <NA> chris 's clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 405.05 413.22 <NA> so what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs <unk> here 's three quick ideas i came up with 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 413 414.73 <NA> this is an iron you know 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 414.73 425.17 <NA> for your clothes to which i added a spraying mechanism so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent and your clothes will smell nicer but hopefully it should also make the ironing
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 431.28 437.57 <NA> <unk> so i brush my teeth twice a day <unk> and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 437.57 442.72 <NA> and when the taste of candy ran out you 'd know it 's time to change your toothbrush 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 442.47 447.37 <NA> finally <unk> i have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet it
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 447.45 454.79 <NA> 's not just the way they look but i love the way they feel when you press down on them <unk> now <unk> i don 't play the flute or the
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 454.75 461.57 <NA> <unk> clarinet <unk> so i decided to combine these keys with an instrument i do play the television remote control 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 462.34 474.26 <NA> now when we look at these three ideas together you 'll notice that the five senses theory doesn 't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 474.58 479.94 <NA> so in conclusion i 've found the five senses theory to be a very useful
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 479.87 488.5 <NA> <unk> tool in evaluating different experiences in my life and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 488.5 494.49 <NA> now <unk> i realize the five senses isn 't the only thing that makes life interesting 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 494.03 499.98 <NA> there 's also the six emotions and that elusive x factor 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 500.03 504.82 <NA> maybe that could be the topic of my next talk <unk> until then
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 504.87 513.4 <NA> <unk> please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs oh one last thing before i leave <unk> 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 513.06 522.5 <NA> here 's the experience you all had while listening to the ted talks however it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste 
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 522.5 525.13 <NA> and the best way to do that is with
JinsopLee_2013 1 JinsopLee_2013 525.72 528.2 <NA> free candy <unk> you guys ready
