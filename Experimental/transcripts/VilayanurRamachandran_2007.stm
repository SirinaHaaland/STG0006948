VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 14.56 24.17 <NA> <unk> chris pointed out i study the human brain the functions and structure of the human brain and i just want you to think for a minute about what this entails <unk> here is this
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 23.71 25.11 <NA> mass of jelly

VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 35.63 43.68 <NA> and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity and this peculiar recursive quality
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 43.4 50.02 <NA> that we call self awareness which i think is the holy grail of neuroscience of neurology <unk> and hopefully someday
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 50.1 58.25 <NA> <unk> understand how that happens ok so how do you study this mysterious organ i mean you have one hundred billion
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 58.07 62.71 <NA> nerve cells little wisps of protoplasm interacting with each other 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 62.25 72.08 <NA> and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness how does this happen <unk> well <unk> there are many ways of approaching
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 71.9 75.02 <NA> the functions of the human brain <unk> one approach
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 75.04 83.81 <NA> <unk> the one we use mainly is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain where there 's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 83.81 86.01 <NA> what then happens is not
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 87.04 96.95 <NA> <unk> reduction in all your mental capacities a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability what you get is a highly selective loss of one function with other functions being preserved intact <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 96.95 104.97 <NA> and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function so you can then map function onto structure
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 105.31 112.44 <NA> and then find out what the circuitry 's doing to generate that particular function <unk> so <unk> that 's what we 're trying to do 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 112.34 119.01 <NA> so let me give you a few striking examples of this in fact i 'm giving you three examples six minutes each during this talk 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 118.67 125.82 <NA> the first example is an extraordinary syndrome called capgras syndrome if you look at the first slide there 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 125.72 129.22 <NA> that 's the temporal lobes frontal lobes parietal lobes
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 130.02 132.07 <NA> <unk> lobes that constitute the brain <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 131.64 140.62 <NA> and if you look tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes you can 't see it there is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 140.34 149.81 <NA> and that 's been called the face area in the brain because when it 's damaged <unk> you can no longer recognize people 's faces <unk> you can still recognize them from their voice and say oh yeah that 's
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 150.7 155.54 <NA> <unk> but you can 't look at their face and know who it is right you can 't even recognize yourself in the mirror <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 155.17 163.73 <NA> i mean you know it 's you because you wink and it winks and you know it 's a mirror <unk> but you don 't really recognize yourself as as yourself 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 163.36 171.06 <NA> ok now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus but there 's another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 170.88 179.76 <NA> physicians have heard about it not even neurologists this is called the capgras delusion and that is a patient who 's otherwise completely normal
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 179.96 186.22 <NA> <unk> a head injury <unk> comes out of coma otherwise completely normal he looks at his mother and says 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 186.22 192.51 <NA> this looks exactly like my mother this woman but she 's an impostor <unk> she 's some other woman pretending to be my mother 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 192.65 199.87 <NA> now why does this happen <unk> why would somebody and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects <unk> but when he sees his mother his
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 202.17 210.25 <NA> <unk> most common interpretation of this which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks is a freudian view <unk> and that is that this chap
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 209.88 213.89 <NA> and the same argument applies to women by the way but i 'll just talk about guys <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 213.68 221.45 <NA> when you 're a little baby a young baby <unk> you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother this is the so called oedipus complex of freud <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 221.45 225.19 <NA> i 'm not saying i believe this but this is the standard freudian view <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 225.39 229.97 <NA> and then as you grow up the cortex develops and inhibits
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 230.07 236.48 <NA> these latent sexual urges towards your mother <unk> thank god or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 236.68 244.08 <NA> and then what happens is there 's a blow to your head damaging the cortex allowing these latent sexual urges
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 243.91 250.02 <NA> to emerge flaming to the surface and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 251.27 260.22 <NA> <unk> my mom how come i 'm being sexually turned on she 's some other woman she 's an impostor it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 260.3 266.32 <NA> this has never made much sense to me this argument it 's very ingenious as all freudian arguments are
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 279.75 286.72 <NA> <unk> exactly like fifi <unk> but it 's some other dog right now you try using the freudian explanation there you 'll
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 286.44 292.82 <NA> start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans or some such thing which is quite absurd of course <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 292.82 299.84 <NA> now <unk> what 's really going on so to explain this curious disorder we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 300.19 309.65 <NA> <unk> in the brain <unk> normally visual signals come in into the eyeballs go to the visual areas in the brain there are in fact thirty areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 309.22 314.69 <NA> and after processing all that the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 314.86 323.81 <NA> <unk> where you perceive faces <unk> there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces <unk> you can call it the face area of the brain <unk> right i talked about that earlier 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 323.56 329.97 <NA> now when that area 's damaged you lose the ability to see faces right but from that area the message
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 329.99 332.46 <NA> <unk> cascades into a structure called the amygdala
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 332.26 335.85 <NA> in the limbic system the emotional core of the brain <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 335.39 344.16 <NA> and that structure called the amygdala <unk> gauges the emotional significance of what you 're looking at is it prey is it predator is it mate
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 343.79 353.38 <NA> or is it something absolutely trivial like a piece of lint <unk> or a piece of chalk <unk> or a i don 't want to point to that but or a shoe or something like that ok <unk> which you can completely ignore 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 353.38 354.97 <NA> so if the amygdala
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 355.02 365.23 <NA> <unk> is excited and this is something important <unk> the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system your heart starts beating faster you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you 're going to
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 364.83 367.87 <NA> create from muscular exertion <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 367.68 379.97 <NA> and that 's fortunate because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating <unk> so i can determine when you 're looking at something whether you 're excited or whether you 're aroused or not
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 380.07 382.04 <NA> ok and i 'll get to that in a minute <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 382.36 390.77 <NA> so my idea was when this chap looks at an object <unk> when he looks at his any object for that matter it goes to the visual areas
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 390.4 399.65 <NA> and however and it 's processed in the fusiform gyrus and you recognize it as a pea plant <unk> or a table or your mother for that matter <unk> ok <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 399.65 402.33 <NA> and then the message cascades into the amygdala <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 402.15 404.97 <NA> and then goes down the autonomic nervous system <unk> but maybe
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 405.08 408.54 <NA> <unk> in this chap that wire that goes from the amygdala
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 408.34 412.62 <NA> to the limbic system the emotional core of the brain is cut by the accident <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 412.4 419.46 <NA> so because the fusiform is intact <unk> the chap can still recognize his mother and says oh yeah <unk> this looks like my mother 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 419.15 425.11 <NA> but because the wire is cut to the emotional centers he says but how come if it 's my mother i don 't experience
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 432.63 439.28 <NA> <unk> how do i account for this inexplicable lack of emotions this can 't be my mother <unk> it 's some strange woman pretending to be my mother 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 439.28 450.05 <NA> how do you test this well what you do is if you take any one of you here and put you in front of a screen and measure your galvanic skin response and show pictures on the screen i can measure how you sweat
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 450.25 459.44 <NA> <unk> when you see an object like a table or an umbrella of course you don 't sweat <unk> if i show you a picture of a lion or a tiger or a pinup you start sweating <unk> right <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 458.95 462.29 <NA> and believe it or not if i show you a picture of your mother
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 461.86 466.28 <NA> i 'm talking about normal people you start sweating <unk> you don 't even have to be jewish laughter
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 468.43 473.09 <NA> now what happens if you show this patient 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 472.6 478.1 <NA> you take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 477.73 479.94 <NA> tables and chairs and
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 479.9 494.24 <NA> <unk> lint <unk> nothing happens as in normal people but when you show him a picture of his mother <unk> the galvanic skin response is flat there 's no emotional reaction to his mother <unk> because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 494.24 499.99 <NA> so his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal his emotions are normal he 'll laugh he 'll cry <unk> so
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 500 511.09 <NA> so forth but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor it 's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do take a bizarre seemingly incomprehensible <unk>
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 511.04 522.8 <NA> neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard freudian view is wrong that in fact you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain <unk> by the way if this patient
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 530.25 534.08 <NA> how are you where are you there 's no delusion through the phone 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 533.71 542.88 <NA> then she approaches him after an hour he says who are you you look just like my mother ok the reason is there 's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 542.67 550.14 <NA> to the emotional centers <unk> and that 's not been cut by the accident <unk> so this explains why through the phone he recognizes
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 553.19 555.48 <NA> <unk> he says it 's an impostor <unk> ok
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 555.56 564.9 <NA> how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain is it nature <unk> genes or is it nurture <unk> and we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 564.67 566.86 <NA> called phantom limb <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 566.86 576.69 <NA> and you all know what a phantom limb is when an arm is amputated <unk> or a leg is amputated for gangrene or you lose it in war for example in the iraq war it 's now a serious problem
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 576.53 579.97 <NA> you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 580.04 588.32 <NA> arm <unk> and that 's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg in fact you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body believe it or not even with internal viscera i
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 588.32 591.31 <NA> 've had patients with the uterus removed
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 591.15 598.24 <NA> hysterectomy who have a phantom uterus including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 598.24 603.2 <NA> time of the month and in fact one student asked me the other day do they get phantom pms

VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 608.47 618.09 <NA> <unk> ok <unk> now the next question is what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments one of the things we 've found was about half the patients with phantom limbs
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 617.88 624.99 <NA> claim that they can move the phantom it 'll pat his brother on the shoulder <unk> it 'll answer the phone when it rings it 'll wave goodbye these are
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 626.66 631.09 <NA> <unk> patient 's not delusional he knows that the arm is not there but nevertheless it 's a compelling
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 630.91 633.39 <NA> sensory experience for the patient 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 633.38 636.97 <NA> but however about half the patients this doesn 't happen <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 636.97 647.89 <NA> the phantom limb they 'll say but doctor the phantom limb is paralyzed <unk> it 's fixed in a clenched spasm and it 's excruciatingly painful <unk> if only i could move it maybe the pain will be relieved 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 647.68 652.23 <NA> now why would a phantom limb be paralyzed it sounds like an oxymoron but
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 651.98 654.85 <NA> when we were looking at the case sheets what we found was
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 654.86 667 <NA> these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury the actual nerve supplying the arm was severed was cut by say a motorcycle accident <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 666.8 672.67 <NA> so the patient had an actual arm <unk> which is painful in a sling for a few months or a year <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 672.67 679.91 <NA> and then in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm <unk> the surgeon amputates the arm <unk> and then you get a phantom arm with the same
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 679.87 681.98 <NA> <unk> pains <unk> right <unk>

VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 687.4 696.41 <NA> ok <unk> so how do you treat this syndrome now why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb when i looked at the case sheet i found that they had an actual arm 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 696.1 704.7 <NA> and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut and the actual arm had been paralyzed and lying in a sling for several months
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 704.99 710.91 <NA> <unk> the amputation and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 710.69 719.05 <NA> itself <unk> why does this happen <unk> when the arm was intact but paralyzed the brain sends commands to the arm the front of the brain saying move 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 719.05 721.83 <NA> but it 's getting visual feedback saying no

VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 734.93 738.62 <NA> that the mere command to move the arm
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 738.14 746.83 <NA> creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm <unk> and then when you 've amputated the arm <unk> this learned paralysis carries over into your body image

VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 750.34 759.8 <NA> <unk> how do you help these patients <unk> how do you unlearn the learned paralysis <unk> so you can relieve him of this excruciating <unk> clenching spasm of the phantom arm <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 759.73 767.21 <NA> well <unk> we said what if you now send the command to the phantom <unk> but give him visual feedback that it 's obeying his command 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 766.78 774.89 <NA> right <unk> maybe you can relieve the phantom pain the phantom cramp <unk> how do you do that well virtual reality but that costs millions of dollars <unk>

VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1000.04 1003.81 <NA> <unk> this happen it 's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict

VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1065.63 1070.51 <NA> this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century he was a cousin of charles darwin 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1070.51 1079.88 <NA> he pointed out that certain people in the population who are otherwise completely normal had the following peculiarity every time they see a number <unk> it 's colored

VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1111.36 1123.4 <NA> synesthesia runs in families so galton said this is a hereditary basis a genetic basis <unk> secondly synesthesia is about and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture which is about creativity
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1123.21 1124.96 <NA> synesthesia is eight times
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1127.53 1134.17 <NA> <unk> novelists and other creative people than in the general population <unk> why would that be i 'm going to answer that question it 's never been answered before <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1134.16 1135.64 <NA> ok <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1135.36 1140.38 <NA> what is synesthesia what causes it well there are many theories one theory is they 're just crazy 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1139.98 1147.16 <NA> now that 's not really a scientific theory so we can forget about it another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads right now 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1147.16 1151.55 <NA> there may be some truth to this because it 's much more common here in the bay area than in san diego
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1154.75 1160.82 <NA> <unk> theory is that well <unk> let 's ask ourselves what 's really going on in synesthesia all right so we found
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1160.6 1169.92 <NA> that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain in the fusiform gyrus <unk> so we said there 's some accidental cross wiring between color
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1169.59 1176.81 <NA> and numbers in the brain <unk> so every time you see a number you see a corresponding color and that 's why you get synesthesia <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1176.5 1179.88 <NA> now remember why does this happen why would there be crossed wires
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1179.93 1186.78 <NA> <unk> some people remember i said it runs in families <unk> that gives you the clue <unk> and that is there is an abnormal gene a mutation
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1186.65 1189.81 <NA> in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1189.81 1202.75 <NA> in all of us <unk> it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else <unk> so every brain region is wired to every other region and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1205.25 1216.11 <NA> and if that gene mutates then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas and if it 's between number and color you get number color synesthesia if it 's between tone and color you get tone color synesthesia <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1216.11 1217.58 <NA> so far so good <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1217.35 1222.1 <NA> now what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain <unk> so everything is cross connected 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1221.64 1229.94 <NA> well <unk> think about what artists <unk> novelists and poets have in common the ability to engage in metaphorical
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1229.84 1239.66 <NA> <unk> thinking linking seemingly unrelated ideas such as it is the east and juliet is the sun well you don 't say juliet is the sun does that mean she 's a glowing ball of fire
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1239.66 1242.63 <NA> <unk> i mean schizophrenics do that but it 's a different story right <unk> 
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1242.5 1249.29 <NA> normal people say she 's warm like the sun she 's radiant like the sun she 's nurturing like the sun <unk> instantly you 've found the links now
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1249.29 1254.94 <NA> if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1255.19 1265.56 <NA> <unk> then it 's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia and hence the eight times more common incidence <unk>
VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1 VilayanurRamachandran_2007 1265.51 1272.74 <NA> of synesthesia among poets artists and novelists ok it 's a very phrenological view of synesthesia <unk> the last demonstration can i take one minute
