MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 163.78 173.24 <NA> so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we 're making the fold but essentially you 're looking at a folded cube <unk> 
MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 173.62 179.94 <NA> and we can play with this <unk> we can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions

MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 234.7 242.36 <NA> the forms that i showed before were made actually through very long trial and error a far more effective way to create forms i have found 
MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 242.36 254.85 <NA> is to use information that is already contained in forms a very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye so for instance we can plot the length of the edges

MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 270.02 274.99 <NA> and that we can use to control the folding so now i 'm not specifying a
MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 277.77 283.04 <NA> <unk> but instead i 'm establishing a rule i 'm establishing a link between a property of a surface

MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 285.33 293.06 <NA> and because i 've designed the process and not the form i can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms
MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 307.81 317.24 <NA> <unk> but the process is a very minimal one there is a simple input it 's always a cube that i start with and it 's a very simple operation it 's making a fold

MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 1 MichaelHansmeyer_2012G 391.48 399.96 <NA> the more interesting question perhaps is are these forms imaginable usually an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he
