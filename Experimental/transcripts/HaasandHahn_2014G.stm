HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 12.82 15.68 <NA> <unk> this theater is built on copacabana 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 15.25 25.17 <NA> which is the most famous beach in the world but twenty five kilometers away from here in the north zone of rio lies a community called vila cruzeiro
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 25.79 35.82 <NA> <unk> and roughly sixty thousand people live there now the people here in rio mostly know vila cruzeiro from the news and unfortunately news from vila cruzeiro often
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 35.65 37.74 <NA> is not good news <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 38.24 43.29 <NA> but vila cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins jeroen koolhaas 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 43.22 49.56 <NA> ten years ago <unk> we first came to rio to shoot a documentary about life in the favelas 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 49.55 55 <NA> now we learned that favelas are informal communities they emerged over the years when immigrants
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 54.96 59.81 <NA> <unk> from the countryside came to the cities looking for work like cities within the cities 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 59.57 65.98 <NA> known for problems like crime <unk> poverty <unk> and the violent drug war between police and the drug gangs <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 65.98 77.29 <NA> so what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands without a master plan and like a giant work in progress 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 77.22 79.67 <NA> where we 're from in holland
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 80.2 84.53 <NA> <unk> is planned we even have rules for how to follow the rules du 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 85.18 95.06 <NA> so the last day of filming we ended up in vila cruzeiro and we were sitting down and we had a drink <unk> and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses and most <unk>
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 94.96 99.9 <NA> <unk> of these houses looked unfinished <unk> and they had walls of bare brick <unk> but we saw some of these
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 100.43 108.63 <NA> <unk> were plastered and painted <unk> and suddenly we had this idea <unk> what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 108.14 111.63 <NA> and then we imagined one big design
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 111.26 118.38 <NA> one big work of art <unk> who would expect something like that in a place like this <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 118.25 124.93 <NA> so we thought would that even be possible so first we started to count the houses but we soon
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 129.96 137.14 <NA> <unk> we had a friend he ran an ngo in vila cruzeiro his name was nanko and he also liked the idea 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 136.77 144.04 <NA> he said you know everybody here would pretty much love to have their houses plastered and painted it 's when a house is finished 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 143.7 149.09 <NA> so he introduced us to the right people and vitor and <unk> maurinho became our crew <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 149.09 154.31 <NA> we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here we made a few designs
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 155.05 163.13 <NA> <unk> and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best so we started painting and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 162.76 165.47 <NA> and we thought that looked already pretty good 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 165.58 173.42 <NA> but they hated it the people who lived there really hated it they said what did you do you painted our house in exactly the same color as the police station 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 174.82 179.97 <NA> in a favela that is not a good thing also the same color as the prison cell
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 180.98 184.47 <NA> so we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 184.46 187.77 <NA> and then we thought we were finished we were really happy <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 187.37 194.76 <NA> but still it wasn 't good because the little kids started coming up to us and they said you know there 's a boy flying the kite but where is his kite 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 194.99 198.64 <NA> we said uh it 's art <unk> you know you have to imagine the kite
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 204.9 212.11 <NA> <unk> we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill so that you could see the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 211.8 219.28 <NA> so the local news started writing about it which was great <unk> and then even the guardian wrote about it notorious slum becomes <unk>
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 221.07 229.97 <NA> so encouraged by this success we went back to rio for a second project <unk> and we stumbled upon this street
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 230.31 240.52 <NA> <unk> it was covered in concrete to prevent mudslides <unk> and somehow we saw a sort of river in it <unk> and we imagined this river to be a river in japanese style
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 240.36 245.27 <NA> with koi carp swimming upstream <unk> so we decided to paint that river <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 245.27 252.11 <NA> and we invited rob admiraal who is a tattoo artist <unk> and he specialized in the japanese style 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 251.8 254.97 <NA> so little did we know that we would spend almost an entire
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 255.11 256.38 <NA> <unk> year
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 256.07 263.22 <NA> painting that river together with geovani and robinho and vitor who lived nearby <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 262.85 266.41 <NA> and we even moved into the neighborhood when
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 265.96 274.62 <NA> one of the guys that lived on the street <unk> elias <unk> told us that we could come and live in his house together with his family which was fantastic 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 274.13 279.01 <NA> unfortunately during that time <unk> another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 293.67 300.11 <NA> we learned that during those times people in communities really stick together during these times
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 301.21 306.14 <NA> <unk> but we also learned a very important element the importance of barbecues 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 306.64 311.26 <NA> laughter because when you throw a barbecue it turns you from a guest into a host <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 311.27 316.71 <NA> so we decided to throw one almost every other week <unk> and we got to know everybody in the neighborhood jk 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 316.49 324.99 <NA> we still had this idea of the hill though du yeah yeah we were talking about the scale of this because this painting was incredibly big and it was
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 329.3 331.18 <NA> <unk> drove us completely insane
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 330.97 332.25 <NA> ourselves <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 332.24 340.95 <NA> but we figured that maybe during this process all the time that we had spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself jk 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 341.42 349.8 <NA> so after all that time this hill this idea was still there and we started to make sketches <unk> models <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 349.82 354.91 <NA> and we figured something out we figured that our ideas our designs had to be a little bit more
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 354.84 358.27 <NA> <unk> simple than that last project so that we could
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 358.07 366.7 <NA> paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time <unk> and we had an opportunity to try that out in a community
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 366.7 370.43 <NA> in the central part of rio which is called santa marta <unk> and
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 370.24 379.94 <NA> we made a design for this place which looked like this <unk> and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if your idea is ridiculously big it 's easier to get
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 379.9 385.55 <NA> <unk> people to go along with this and the people of santa marta
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 385.33 390.08 <NA> got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 397.21 400.02 <NA> and this image somehow went all over the
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 400.79 408.68 <NA> <unk> so then we received an unexpected phone call from the philadelphia mural arts program <unk> and
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 408.52 418.52 <NA> they had this question if this idea our approach if this would actually work in north philly <unk> which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the united states <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 418.52 424.84 <NA> so we immediately said yes we had no idea how but it seemed like a very
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 426.06 431.86 <NA> <unk> so we did exactly the same as we did in rio <unk> and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 436.74 438.04 <NA> so
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 437.81 450.31 <NA> the project took almost two years to complete <unk> and we made individual designs for every single house on the avenue that we painted <unk> and we made these designs together with the local store owners the building owners <unk> and
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 450.3 451.66 <NA> a team of
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 451.68 454.97 <NA> about a dozen young men and women they were hired
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 454.63 457.94 <NA> <unk> hired <unk> and then they were trained as painters <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 457.63 465.26 <NA> and together they transformed their own neighborhood the whole street into a giant patchwork of color 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 472.52 478.07 <NA> and at the end the city of philadelphia thanked every single one of them
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 477.73 479.97 <NA> and gave them a merit for their
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 479.93 486.51 <NA> <unk> accomplishment jk so now we had painted a whole street <unk> how about we do this whole hill now 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 487.28 493.23 <NA> we started looking for funding <unk> but instead we just ran into questions <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 492.8 496.47 <NA> like how many houses are you going to paint 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 496.22 500.05 <NA> how many square meters is that how much paint are you going
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 500.76 509.11 <NA> <unk> how many people are you going to employ <unk> and we we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer all those questions <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 508.92 518.18 <NA> but then we thought in order to answer all those questions you have to know exactly what you 're going to do before you actually get there and start <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 518.18 521.59 <NA> and maybe it 's a mistake to think like that 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 521.13 527.98 <NA> it would lose some of the magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 527.7 529.97 <NA> you can let the project grow organically
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 530.08 531.92 <NA> <unk> and have a life of its own du 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 533.2 535.4 <NA> so what we did is
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 535.78 543.54 <NA> we decided to take this plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 543.36 549.56 <NA> just go back to the base idea which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 549.56 554.85 <NA> and instead of looking for funding we started a crowdfunding campaign
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 555.02 561.45 <NA> <unk> and in a little over a month more than one thousand five hundred people put together and donated over one hundred thousand dollars <unk> 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 561.62 565.83 <NA> so for us this was an amazing moment because now 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 568.73 574.62 <NA> because now we we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 574.62 580 <NA> and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built from the ground
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 580.1 583.3 <NA> on up bottom up with no master plan jk 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 583.26 597.37 <NA> so we went back and we employed angelo <unk> and he 's a local artist from vila cruzeiro very talented guy and he knows almost everybody there and then we employed elias our former landlord who invited us into his house and he 's a master of construction 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 597.06 604.1 <NA> together with them we decided where to start <unk> we picked this spot in vila cruzeiro <unk> and houses are being plastered as we speak
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 605.04 613.2 <NA> good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next they 're even printing t shirts they 're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 613.2 615.41 <NA> and talking to the press 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 614.92 622.25 <NA> this article about angelo appeared du so while this is happening we are bringing this idea all over the world <unk> so 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 621.97 629.97 <NA> like the project we did in philadelphia we are also invited to do workshops for instance in curaao and right now we 're planning a
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 629.9 632.24 <NA> <unk> huge project in haiti jk 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 632.25 640.3 <NA> so the favela was not only the place where this idea started it was also the place that made it possible
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 639.88 643.71 <NA> to work without a master plan
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 643.31 649.63 <NA> because these communities are informal this was the inspiration and in a communal effort together with the people 
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 649.63 654.58 <NA> you can almost work like in an orchestra where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 655.23 657.56 <NA> <unk> so we want to thank everybody who
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 657.56 671.51 <NA> wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way <unk> and we are looking at continuing jk yeah <unk> and so one day pretty soon when the colors start going up on these walls we hope more people will join us and
HaasandHahn_2014G 1 HaasandHahn_2014G 671.32 676.37 <NA> join this big dream and maybe one day the whole of vila cruzeiro will be painted
