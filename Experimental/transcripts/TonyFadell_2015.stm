TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 575.76 583.52 <NA> <unk> but let me leave you with a few tips that i do <unk> that we all can do to fight habituation my first tip
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 583.31 585.55 <NA> is to look broader <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 585.45 593.56 <NA> you see when you 're tackling a problem <unk> sometimes there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem <unk> and sometimes a lot of steps after it 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 593.67 596.24 <NA> if you can take a step back
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 596 600.05 <NA> and look broader <unk> maybe you can change some of those boxes before the
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 600.7 605.99 <NA> <unk> maybe you can combine them <unk> maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 605.53 607.8 <NA> take thermostats for instance 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 607.8 614.9 <NA> in the 1900s when they first came out they were really simple to use you could turn them up or turn them down <unk> people understood them <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 617.37 623.03 <NA> the energy crisis struck and customers started thinking about how to save energy <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 622.81 629.97 <NA> so what happened <unk> thermostat designers decided to add a new step instead of just turning up and down <unk> you now
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 629.96 639.42 <NA> <unk> had to program it <unk> so you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time now that seemed great every thermostat had started adding that feature 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 639.35 641.55 <NA> but it turned out
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 641.06 646.71 <NA> that no one saved any energy now why is that well people couldn 't
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 646.71 654.97 <NA> predict the future they just didn 't know how their weeks would change season to season year to year so no
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 654.9 664.63 <NA> <unk> one was saving energy and what happened <unk> thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that programming step they made better u i s 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 664.68 672.04 <NA> they made better documentation but still years later people were not saving any energy
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 671.97 675.01 <NA> because they just couldn 't predict the future <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 678.28 681.02 <NA> <unk> algorithm in instead of the programming
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 680.59 690.03 <NA> that would simply watch when you turned it up and down <unk> when you liked a certain temperature when you got up or when you went away and you know what it worked <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 690.03 693.65 <NA> people are saving energy without any programming 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 694.51 703.25 <NA> so it doesn 't matter what you 're doing if you take a step back and look at all the boxes maybe there 's a way to remove one or combine them
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 702.82 704.97 <NA> so that you can make that process
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 704.99 713.55 <NA> <unk> much simpler so that 's my first tip look broader for my second tip it 's to look closer 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 713.75 716.7 <NA> one of my greatest teachers was my grandfather

TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 754.9 756.17 <NA> <unk> did we do <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 755.98 759.5 <NA> i remembered that story that my grandfather told me <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 759.28 768.09 <NA> and so we thought how many different screws can we put in the box was it going to be two three four five <unk> because there 's so many different wall types 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 768.09 775.16 <NA> so we thought about it <unk> we optimized it <unk> and we came up with three different screws to put in the box 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 775.21 779.58 <NA> we thought that was going to solve the problem <unk> but it turned out it
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 780.83 785.82 <NA> so we shipped the product and people weren 't having a great experience <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 785.72 791.79 <NA> so what did we do <unk> we went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn 't get it right 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 791.84 795.87 <NA> and we designed a special screw a custom screw 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 795.56 803.2 <NA> much to the chagrin of our investors they were like why are you spending so much time on a little screw get out there and sell more
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 805.05 807.61 <NA> <unk> more if we get this right 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 807.51 809.66 <NA> and it turned out we did 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 809.66 815.23 <NA> with that custom little screw there was just one screw in the box that was easy to mount and put on the wall 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 817.11 821.05 <NA> so if we focus on those tiny details <unk> the ones <unk>
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 822.18 824.96 <NA> <unk> we may not see and we look at
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 828.22 832.46 <NA> <unk> or is that the way we 've always done it <unk> maybe there 's a way to get rid of those 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 833.56 838.46 <NA> so my last piece of advice is to think younger 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 839.68 847.92 <NA> every day i 'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids they come up with questions like why can 't cars fly around traffic
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 855.11 864.15 <NA> <unk> those questions are smart my son came to me the other day and i asked him go run out to the mailbox and check it he looked at me 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 864.26 870.82 <NA> puzzled and said why doesn 't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 879.69 885.31 <NA> <unk> sometimes we find out we just don 't have the right answers we say 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 885.18 894.04 <NA> son that 's just the way the world works so the more we 're exposed to something the more we get used to it <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 894.48 898.37 <NA> but kids haven 't been around long enough to get used to those things <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 898.37 904.4 <NA> and so when they run into problems they immediately try to solve them <unk> and sometimes they find a better way
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 904.99 907.52 <NA> <unk> and that way really is better <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 907.39 913.67 <NA> so my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 913.39 915.8 <NA> or people with young minds <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 915.8 923.75 <NA> because if you have those young minds <unk> they cause everyone in the room to think younger <unk> picasso once said 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 923.26 925.23 <NA> every child is an artist
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 928.61 932.61 <NA> <unk> is when he or she grows up is how to remain an artist 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 933.08 940.11 <NA> we all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time before a lifetime of habits got in the way 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 940.1 949.69 <NA> our challenge is to get back there to feel that frustration to see those little details to look broader <unk> look
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 951.15 952.93 <NA> <unk> and to think younger
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 953.04 955.75 <NA> so we can stay beginners <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 955.38 962.26 <NA> it 's not easy it requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 962.97 966.73 <NA> but if we do <unk> we could do some pretty amazing things 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 966.78 970.21 <NA> for me <unk> hopefully that 's better product design <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 970.14 975.01 <NA> for you that could mean something else something powerful 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 977.4 979.91 <NA> our challenge is to wake up each
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 979.87 984.17 <NA> <unk> day and say how can i experience the world better 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 984.13 986.18 <NA> and if we do <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 985.9 993.65 <NA> maybe just maybe we can get rid of these dumb little stickers <unk> 
TonyFadell_2015 1 TonyFadell_2015 993.82 995.01 <NA> thank you very much
