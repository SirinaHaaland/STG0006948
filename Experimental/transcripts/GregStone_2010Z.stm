GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 825.45 829.91 <NA> and it basically killed sixty percent of the coral so
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 829.84 839.51 <NA> <unk> suddenly we had this area that we were protecting but now it it appeared to be dead at least in the coral areas of course the deep sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine but the coral which everybody likes to look at was in trouble 
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 839.29 841.68 <NA> well <unk> the good news is
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 841.2 842.55 <NA> it 's recovered
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 842.55 851.73 <NA> and recovering fast faster than any reef we 've seen this picture was just taken by brian skerry a few months ago when we returned to the phoenix islands
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 851.51 854.97 <NA> and discovered that because it is a protected area and has

GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 877.05 883.98 <NA> <unk> 's the only threat the only influence that the reef had to deal with there was no fishing there was no pollution there was no coastal development 
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 883.98 887.14 <NA> and the reef is on a full bore recovery 
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 887.61 895.61 <NA> now i remember that dinner i had with the minister of fisheries ten years ago when we first brought this up and i got quite animated during the dinner and said well i think that the
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 895.45 903.83 <NA> conservation community might embrace this idea minister he paused and put his hands together and said yes greg <unk> but the devil will be in the details
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 905.14 910.91 <NA> <unk> and it certainly was the last ten years have been detail after detail ranging from

GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 945.98 950.17 <NA> for this so it 's a very solid very well thought out very well grounded

GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 958.46 964.49 <NA> so the conditions for success here are listed you can read them yourselves but i would say the most important one in my mind
GregStone_2010Z 1 GregStone_2010Z 964.31 972.64 <NA> was working within the market forces of the situation <unk> and that insured that we could move this forward and it would have
