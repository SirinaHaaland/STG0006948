ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 120.13 124.36 <NA> so starting with steel how do you make steel <unk> i went and
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 124.17 129.97 <NA> knocked on the door of the rio tinto chair of advanced mineral extraction at the royal school
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 129.93 136.35 <NA> <unk> of mines and said how do you make steel and professor cilliers was very kind and talked me through it 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 136.36 144.97 <NA> and my vague rememberings from <unk> gcse science well steel comes from iron <unk> so i phoned up an iron mine and said 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 144.72 148.52 <NA> hi i 'm trying to make a toaster can i come up and get some
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 148.33 149.99 <NA> iron 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 151.06 153.5 <NA> <unk> when i got there emerges ray

ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 180.2 182.62 <NA> <unk> when you study geology you can see
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 182.38 185.82 <NA> what 's happened in the past and there were terrific
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 185.82 187.38 <NA> changes in the earth thomas thwaites 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 193.37 199.96 <NA> as you can see they had the christmas decorations up and of course <unk> it wasn 't actually a working mine
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 201.69 205.35 <NA> <unk> though ray was a miner there the mine had closed and had
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 205.13 210.2 <NA> been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction because of course it can 't compete
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 210.02 217.2 <NA> on the scale of operations which are happening in south america <unk> australia <unk> wherever <unk> but anyway i got my
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 217.2 229.55 <NA> my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to london on the train and then was faced with the problem okay how do you make this rock into components for a toaster <unk> so i went back to professor cilliers and he said
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 230.05 236.18 <NA> <unk> to the library so i did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 236.47 242.49 <NA> completely useless for what i was trying to do because of course they don 't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 242.31 245.37 <NA> and you don 't have a smelting plant <unk> 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 245.37 254.97 <NA> so i ended up going to the history of science library and looking at this book this is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the west at least and there you can see that woodcut
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 255.1 258.39 <NA> is basically what i ended up doing but instead of a
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 258.02 261.39 <NA> bellows i had a leaf blower <unk> 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 261.74 270.24 <NA> and that was something that reoccurred throughout the project was the smaller the scale you want to work on the further back in time you have to go
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 269.9 272.04 <NA> <unk> and so this is
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 271.58 279.97 <NA> after a day and and about half a night smelting this iron i dragged out this stuff and it wasn 't iron
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 280.04 281.28 <NA> <unk> but
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 281.06 282.7 <NA> luckily
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 282.57 291.74 <NA> <unk> i found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves and at thirty minutes at full power <unk> and i was able to finish off the process
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 294.12 296.59 <NA> so my next 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 300.36 302 <NA> the next thing i was trying to get was
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 304.87 306.23 <NA> <unk> this mine
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 306 309.11 <NA> was once the largest copper mine in the world it 's
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 308.83 317.6 <NA> not anymore <unk> but i found a a retired geology professor to take me down <unk> and he said okay i 'll let you have some water from the mine 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 317.59 321.54 <NA> and the reason i was interested in getting water is because
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 321.35 325.02 <NA> water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 325 332.73 <NA> will start picking up dissolving the minerals from the mine and a good example of this is the rio tinto <unk> which is in portugal 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 332.73 336.78 <NA> as you can see it 's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 336.32 340.36 <NA> so many such that it 's now just a home for
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 340.17 353.11 <NA> bacteria who really like acidic toxic conditions <unk> but anyway the water i dragged back from the isle of anglesey where the mine was there was enough copper in it such that i could cast the pins of my metal electric plug
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 354.87 361.96 <NA> <unk> thing i was off to scotland to get mica <unk> and mica is a mineral
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 362.94 367.41 <NA> which is a very good insulator and very good
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 367.41 375.08 <NA> at insulating electricity that 's me getting mica <unk> and the last material i 'm going to talk about today is plastic
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 376.57 379.34 <NA> <unk> my toaster had to have a plastic case 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 379.24 389.45 <NA> plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods <unk> and so plastic comes from oil so i phoned up bp and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the <unk>
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 389.4 399.83 <NA> pr office at bp that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil <unk> bp obviously has a bit more on their mind now
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 405.76 416.16 <NA> never did <unk> so i looked at other ways of making plastic and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants but also from starches so this <unk>
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 416.06 429.67 <NA> <unk> is attempting to make potato starch plastic <unk> and for a while that was looking really good i poured it into the mold which you can see there which i 've made from a tree trunk <unk> and it was looking good for a while but i left it outside because you had to leave it outside to dry
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 430.02 436.67 <NA> <unk> unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato <unk> so
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 436.67 441.17 <NA> kind of out of desperation i decided
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 440.97 448.18 <NA> that i could think laterally <unk> and geologists have actually christened well they 're debating whether to christen the age that we 're living in
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 448.44 454.82 <NA> they 're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the anthropocene the age of man <unk> and that 's because
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 455.05 468.72 <NA> <unk> geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now <unk> so suddenly it will become kind of radioactive from chernobyl and the two thousand or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since one thousand nine hundred and
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 468.72 471.95 <NA> forty five and there 'd also be an extinction event
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 471.94 474.99 <NA> like fossils would suddenly disappear
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 481.61 483.87 <NA> <unk> embedded in the rock <unk> so
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 483.38 489.45 <NA> i looked up a plastic so i decided that i could mine some of this modern day rock
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 489.14 500.17 <NA> <unk> and i went up to manchester to visit a place called axion recycling <unk> and they 're at the sharp end of what 's called the weee <unk> which is this european electrical and electronic
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 501.87 509.35 <NA> <unk> and that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 509.04 514.6 <NA> made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill but
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 514.24 515.24 <NA> this
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 587.25 590.32 <NA> <unk> there 's a picture of my toaster

ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 609.34 618.8 <NA> <unk> did plug it in i don 't know if you could see but i was never able to make insulation for the wires <unk> kew gardens were insistent that i couldn 't come and
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 618.34 625.05 <NA> hack into their rubber tree so the wires were uninsulated so there was two hundred and forty volts going through these
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 628.34 636.66 <NA> <unk> and for about five seconds the toaster toasted <unk> but then <unk> unfortunately the element kind of melted itself <unk> 
ThomasThwaites_2010S 1 ThomasThwaites_2010S 636.77 639.31 <NA> but i considered it a partial success
