PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 804.9 817.51 <NA> today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace it 's about energy emissions <unk> the european union ets is the main marketplace it 's not doing too well we 've over issued a bit like inflation <unk> you over issue currency you get what you see
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 817.05 825.05 <NA> declining prices <unk> but that 's all about energy and industry but what we 're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon that
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 825.73 840.65 <NA> <unk> what we 're also missing is blue carbon which by the way is the largest store of carbon more than fifty five percent <unk> thankfully <unk> the flux in other words the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa is more or less balanced in fact what 's being absorbed is something like
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 840.19 842.54 <NA> twenty five percent of our emissions <unk> 
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 842.54 853.59 <NA> which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans more of that in a minute <unk> and finally <unk> there 's deforestation and there 's emission of methane from
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 853.31 854.31 <NA> agriculture
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 855.02 858.46 <NA> <unk> green carbon which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions <unk> 
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 858.25 871.26 <NA> and blue carbon together comprise twenty five percent of our emissions we have the means already in our hands <unk> through a structure through a mechanism called redd plus a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 871.26 879.97 <NA> and already norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards indonesia and brazil to implement this red plus scheme <unk> so we actually have some movement
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 880.04 883.63 <NA> forward but the thing is to do a lot more of that will this solve
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 883.46 892.12 <NA> the problem will economics solve everything <unk> well i 'm afraid not there is an area that is the oceans <unk> coral reefs as you can see 
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 892.38 901.72 <NA> they cut across the entire globe all the way from micronesia across indonesia malaysia <unk> india <unk> madagascar and to the west of the caribbean 
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 901.5 904.88 <NA> these red dots these red areas basically provide the
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 904.81 915.98 <NA> <unk> food and livelihood for more than half a billion people so that 's almost an eighth of society and the sad thing is that as these coral reefs are lost and scientists tell us that any level of
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 915.75 921.42 <NA> carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above three hundred and fifty parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 921.42 929.97 <NA> we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species the warm water corals we 're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans but we are
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 929.93 933.18 <NA> <unk> risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than

PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 937.34 943.91 <NA> so in selecting targets of four hundred and fifty parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations 
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 943.91 950.11 <NA> what we have done is we 've made an ethical choice we 've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 950 954.68 <NA> <unk> have coral reefs well what i will say to you in parting is that
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 954.47 962.14 <NA> we may have done that let 's think about it and what it means but please let 's not do more of that because mother nature only has that much in ecological
PavanSukhdev_2011G 1 PavanSukhdev_2011G 962.14 968.27 <NA> infrastructure and that much natural capital <unk> i don 't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices <unk> thank you
