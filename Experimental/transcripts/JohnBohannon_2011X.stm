JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 37.67 46.06 <NA> <unk> good afternoon as you 're all aware we face difficult economic times i come to you with a modest proposal
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 46.06 54.97 <NA> for easing the financial burden this idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at mit he was struggling to explain
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 54.93 60.13 <NA> <unk> something to me a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 60.51 68.38 <NA> now he confused me from the very start because light doesn 't cool things down <unk> it makes it hotter it 's happening right now <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 68.1 78.1 <NA> the reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than one hundred quintillion photons and they 're moving randomly through the space <unk> near the speed of light 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 78.1 79.79 <NA> all of them are different colors
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 79.93 89.94 <NA> <unk> rippling with different frequencies <unk> and they 're bouncing off every surface including me and some of those are flying directly into your eyes <unk> and that 's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 89.94 91.85 <NA> now a laser is different 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 91.51 95.93 <NA> it also uses photons <unk> but they 're all synchronized <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 95.8 100.14 <NA> and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 101.27 105.73 <NA> <unk> the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 105.73 112.83 <NA> you can use it to store massive amounts of data <unk> and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 112.76 121.5 <NA> first you trap atoms in a special bottle <unk> it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 121.16 129.94 <NA> and the atoms themselves are quite violent <unk> but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 129.9 134.74 <NA> <unk> those photons and tend to slow down little by little
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 134.28 135.89 <NA> it gets colder

JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 140.1 147.31 <NA> now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough something truly bizarre happens <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 146.85 153.25 <NA> it 's no longer a solid a liquid or a gas <unk> it enters a new state of matter called a superfluid <unk>

JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 154.96 161.35 <NA> <unk> lose their individual identity <unk> and the rules from the quantum world take over <unk> and that 's what gives superfluids such

JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 166.84 172.29 <NA> it is able to slow photons down to sixty kilometers per hour
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 180.02 189.54 <NA> <unk> another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction so if you were to take the lid off that bottle <unk> it won 't stay inside 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 189.08 194.64 <NA> a thin film will creep up the inside wall <unk> flow over the top
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 194.45 203.25 <NA> and right out the outside now of course <unk> the moment that it does hit the outside environment <unk> and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 203.25 204.94 <NA> it immediately turns back into normal matter
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 205.23 208.93 <NA> superfluids are one of the most fragile things we 've ever discovered <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 208.56 215.44 <NA> and this is the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 215.07 220.9 <NA> but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 220.56 226.45 <NA> i have a ph d in molecular biology <unk> i still barely understand what most scientists are talking about 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 226.38 229.55 <NA> so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 229.9 231.05 <NA> <unk> it seemed like
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 230.82 235.16 <NA> the more he said <unk> the less i understood <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 235 242.12 <NA> because if you 're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its essence <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 241.81 245.21 <NA> the fewer words you use the better 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 245.5 254.97 <NA> in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all i remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 254.9 256.47 <NA> <unk> around when you need them <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 257.42 263.37 <NA> now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds <unk> i started a contest four years ago called dance your ph d 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 263.37 268.65 <NA> instead of explaining their research with words scientists have to explain it with dance 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 268.34 274.68 <NA> now surprisingly <unk> it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 274.52 278.14 <NA> but don 't take my word for it go on the internet and search for dance your
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 280.11 281.98 <NA> <unk> of dancing scientists waiting for you 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 281.97 289.78 <NA> the most surprising thing that i 've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 289.35 297.61 <NA> for example at the university of minnesota <unk> there 's a biomedical engineer named david odde and he works with dancers to study how cells move 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 297.15 304.88 <NA> they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up on one side <unk> it triggers the cell to expand its
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 304.81 313.22 <NA> <unk> shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment <unk> so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 312.73 316.82 <NA> but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 316.51 327.35 <NA> is really more like chaos inside <unk> because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers <unk> and those fibers are constantly falling apart <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 326.89 329.97 <NA> but just as quickly as they explode more proteins
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 329.93 336.48 <NA> <unk> attach to the ends and grow them longer so it 's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 336.26 346.77 <NA> now david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab <unk> but before he does that he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 346.67 349.99 <NA> it 's basically efficient brainstorming and when i
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 350 355.27 <NA> <unk> visited david to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 355.08 358.96 <NA> rather than the usual method powerpoint <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 359.19 367.01 <NA> and this brings me to my modest proposal i think that bad powerpoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 380.59 384.99 <NA> but one estimate has put the drain at two hundred and fifty million dollars per day <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 384.99 391.67 <NA> now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of thirty five thousand dollars <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 391.36 397.34 <NA> and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 397.06 403.82 <NA> and given that there are some apparently thirty million powerpoint presentations created every day 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 403.6 404.94 <NA> that would indeed
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 404.93 413.88 <NA> <unk> add up to an annual waste of one hundred billion dollars of course that 's just the time we 're losing sitting through presentations 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 414.77 416.88 <NA> there are other costs <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 416.39 424.77 <NA> because powerpoint is a tool <unk> and like any tool it can and will be abused to borrow a concept from my country 's cia <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 424.28 427.2 <NA> it helps you to soften up your audience 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 427.43 429.91 <NA> it distracts them with pretty pictures
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 429.95 437.5 <NA> irrelevant data <unk> it allows you to create the illusion of competence <unk> the illusion of simplicity <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 437.46 442.09 <NA> and most destructively <unk> the illusion of understanding <unk> 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 443.43 450.14 <NA> so now my country is fifteen trillion dollars in debt our leaders are working tirelessly
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 450.04 456.53 <NA> <unk> to try and find ways to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts 
JohnBohannon_2011X 1 JohnBohannon_2011X 456.28 467.27 <NA> for example our national endowment for the arts with its $ one hundred and fifty million budget <unk> slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one one thousandth of a percent <unk>
