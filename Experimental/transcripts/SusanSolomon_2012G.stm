SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 208.95 217.99 <NA> much faster and at a much lower cost so let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context this is
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 217.56 224.87 <NA> an extremely new field in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight human embryonic stem cells were first
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 225.88 229.01 <NA> <unk> and just nine years later a group of scientists
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 228.79 238.64 <NA> in japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem <unk>

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 257.38 270.4 <NA> so a few months later in two thousand and eight one of our scientists built on that research he took skin biopsies this time from people who had a disease als or as you call it in the u k motor neuron disease he turned them into the ips
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 270.4 277.98 <NA> cells that i 've just told you about and then he turned those ips cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease <unk> 
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 277.55 279.97 <NA> so basically what he did was to take
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 280.01 288.37 <NA> a healthy cell and turn it into a sick cell and he recapitulated the disease over and over again in the dish <unk> and
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 287.88 298.16 <NA> this was extraordinary because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells and as he watched the disease unfold 
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 298.11 304.97 <NA> <unk> he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 305.04 308.99 <NA> <unk> there was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 308.53 321.32 <NA> and contributing to the death of these motor neurons and you simply couldn 't see it until you had the human model <unk> so you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 325.19 326.34 <NA> <unk> were much like

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 342.97 347.55 <NA> and stem cells really have given us the black box
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 347.3 354.79 <NA> for diseases and it 's an unprecedented window it really is extraordinary because you can recapitulate
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 354.99 361.48 <NA> <unk> many many diseases in a dish you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 361.2 365.77 <NA> well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient 
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 365.46 371.89 <NA> and this opens up the ability <unk> which hopefully will will become something that
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 371.67 379.79 <NA> is routine in the near term of using human cells to test for drugs right now
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 379.87 389.45 <NA> the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic to bring a successful drug to market it takes on average thirteen years that 's one drug

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 410.87 417.63 <NA> what 's involved and the cost to all of us so the way we develop drugs now
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 417.35 429.94 <NA> is by testing promising compounds on we didn 't have disease modeling with human cells <unk> so we 'd been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that that we engineer

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 474.56 479.82 <NA> absolutely extraordinary and you 're going to know at the beginning the very

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 506.49 515.45 <NA> look around this room we are all different <unk> and a disease that i might have if i had alzheimer 's disease or parkinson 's disease 
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 515.45 523.67 <NA> it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease and if we both had

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 546 552.48 <NA> and you know this seems totally obvious <unk> but unfortunately it is not the way that
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 552.31 554.88 <NA> the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 554.84 561.45 <NA> <unk> because until now <unk> it hasn 't had the tools <unk> and so we need to move away from this <unk>

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 563.57 574.93 <NA> the way we 've been developing drugs is essentially like going into a shoe store no one asks you what size you are or if you 're going dancing or hiking <unk> they just say well you have feet here are your
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 575.94 585.37 <NA> <unk> it doesn 't work with shoes <unk> and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet <unk> so we really have to change this

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 654.93 661.48 <NA> <unk> it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine the people for whom it was a disaster
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 661.08 669.1 <NA> <unk> or fatal would never have been given it <unk> and you can imagine a very different outcome for the company who had to withdraw the drug <unk> 
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 669.3 670.87 <NA> so
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 670.59 679.94 <NA> that is terrific <unk> and we thought all right as we 're trying to solve this problem <unk> clearly we have to think about genetics we have

SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 715.1 725.53 <NA> so we looked at this <unk> and we thought <unk> okay <unk> artisanal is wonderful in you know your clothing and your bread and crafts but
SusanSolomon_2012G 1 SusanSolomon_2012G 725.29 729.46 <NA> artisanal really isn 't going to work in stem cells so we have to deal with this
