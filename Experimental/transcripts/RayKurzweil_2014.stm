RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 38.09 44.56 <NA> rather than the fixed behaviors that non mammalian animals have it could invent new behaviors <unk> 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 44.56 50.05 <NA> so a mouse is escaping a predator its path is blocked it 'll try to invent
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 49.88 54.79 <NA> a new solution that may work it may not but if it does it will remember that and have a new

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 58.54 67.33 <NA> another mouse watching this could say hey that was pretty clever going around that rock and it could adopt a new behavior as well
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 66.93 74.54 <NA> non mammalian animals couldn 't do any of those things they had fixed behaviors now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 89.69 94.13 <NA> and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior now
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 93.67 97.25 <NA> that went along fine but then something happened
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 96.91 104.88 <NA> sixty five million years ago there was a sudden violent change to the environment we call it the cretaceous extinction event

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 121.34 129.67 <NA> this neocortex is pretty good stuff and it began to grow it and mammals got bigger their brains got bigger at an even faster pace
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 130.02 138.97 <NA> <unk> and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 195.2 198.82 <NA> and there was actually very little to go on

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 238.47 246.02 <NA> these modules we have about three hundred million of them <unk> and we create them in these hierarchies i 'll give you a simple example <unk>

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 283.1 293.24 <NA> it 'll think to itself hmm i think an e is probably likely and it 'll send a signal down to all the e recognizers saying be on the lookout for an e i think one might be coming the e recognizers
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 293.19 300.02 <NA> <unk> will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing could be an e ordinarily you wouldn 't think so but we 're expecting an e it 's good
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 302.38 303.83 <NA> <unk> 've seen an apple 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 303.67 316.37 <NA> go up another five levels and you 're now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy and stretch down into the different senses <unk> and you may have a module that sees a certain fabric hears a certain voice quality smells a certain perfume 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 316.37 318.83 <NA> and will say my wife has entered the room 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 318.61 323.94 <NA> go up another ten levels and now you 're at a very high level you 're probably in the frontal cortex <unk> 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 323.94 329.55 <NA> and you 'll have modules that say that was ironic that 's funny <unk> she 's pretty
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 329.96 336.15 <NA> <unk> might think that those are more sophisticated but actually what 's more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 335.99 345.19 <NA> there was a 16 year old girl she had brain surgery and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her you can do that because there 's no pain receptors in the brain 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 345.19 354.97 <NA> and whenever they stimulated particular very small points on her neocortex shown here in red she would laugh so at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 355.25 365.39 <NA> <unk> but no they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor <unk> and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 365.39 369.28 <NA> you guys are so funny just standing around was the typical comment
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 369.03 374.47 <NA> <unk> and they weren 't funny <unk> not while doing surgery <unk> 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 380.83 390.03 <NA> <unk> actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex i actually described the algorithm which is similar
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 389.82 398.24 <NA> to something called a hierarchical hidden markov model something i 've worked on since the ' 90s jeopardy is a very broad

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 412.9 423.1 <NA> and jennings and the other guy didn 't get that it 's a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language and it actually got its knowledge by reading wikipedia and several other
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 422.94 429.94 <NA> encyclopedias five to ten years from now search engines will actually be based on not just

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 437.31 446.65 <NA> and in books so you 'll be walking along and google will pop up and say <unk> you know mary you expressed concern to me a month ago that your <unk>
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 448.08 450.23 <NA> <unk> wasn 't getting past the blood brain barrier
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 450.55 458.33 <NA> <unk> new research just came out thirteen seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione let me summarize it for you 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 458.35 460.79 <NA> twenty years from now we
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 460.63 468.05 <NA> 'll have nanobots because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology they 'll go into our brain
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 468.04 473.55 <NA> through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 473.34 474.99 <NA> synthetic neocortex in the

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 479.17 488.95 <NA> now today <unk> i mean you have a computer in your phone but if you need ten thousand computers for a few seconds to do a complex search you can access that for a second or two
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 488.77 490.44 <NA> in the cloud in the <unk>
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 491.47 500.08 <NA> you need some extra neocortex you 'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain so i 'm walking along and i say oh there 's chris anderson
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 500.4 505.15 <NA> <unk> 's coming my way i 'd better think of something clever to say <unk> i 've got three seconds 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 505.15 514.18 <NA> my three hundred million modules <unk> in my neocortex isn 't going to cut it i need a billion more i 'll be able to access that in the cloud 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 513.84 520.43 <NA> and our thinking then will be a hybrid of biological and non biological thinking <unk> 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 520.43 527.56 <NA> but the non biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns <unk> it will grow exponentially <unk> 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 527.49 529.94 <NA> and remember what happens the last
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 529.81 536.72 <NA> <unk> time we expanded our neocortex that was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 536.23 544.27 <NA> other primates have a slanted brow they don 't have the frontal cortex <unk> but the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different <unk> 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 544.27 553.35 <NA> it 's a quantitative expansion of neocortex but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 553.17 554.97 <NA> and invent language
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 555.11 560.88 <NA> <unk> and art and science and technology and ted conferences no other species has done that 
RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 560.48 569.11 <NA> and so over the next few decades we 're going to do it again we 're going to again expand our neocortex only this time we won 't be limited by a

RayKurzweil_2014 1 RayKurzweil_2014 575.7 583.75 <NA> that additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology <unk> thank you very much
