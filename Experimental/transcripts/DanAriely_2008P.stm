DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 36.58 39.96 <NA> came up with an idea that i would write a cookbook
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 39.71 45.81 <NA> <unk> and the title for my cookbook was going to be dining without crumbs the art of eating over the sink 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 47.15 54.97 <NA> and it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen i was quite excited about this i was going to talk a little bit about research a little bit about the kitchen
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 55.34 62.92 <NA> we do so much in the kitchen i thought this would be interesting i wrote a couple of chapters and took it to mit press and they said <unk>

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 71.04 79.94 <NA> until somebody said <unk> look if you 're serious about this you have to write about your research first you have to publish something then you 'll get
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 80.07 83.96 <NA> the opportunity to write something else if you really want to do it you have to do it 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 83.96 91.26 <NA> i said i don 't want to write about my research i do it all day long i want to write something a bit more free less constrained 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 91.02 93.41 <NA> and this person was very
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 92.92 99.93 <NA> forceful and said look that 's the only way you 'll ever do it so i said okay if i have to do it i had a sabbatical <unk>
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 101.21 106.45 <NA> <unk> about my research if there 's no other way and then i 'll get to do my cookbook so i wrote a
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 106.21 112.17 <NA> a book on my research and it turned out to be quite fun in two ways first of all i enjoyed
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 112.17 117.09 <NA> writing but the more interesting thing was that i started learning from people
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 116.78 124.6 <NA> it 's a fantastic time to write because there 's so much feedback you can get from people <unk> people write to me about their personal experience and about their

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 146.39 154.82 <NA> so think about these two tables <unk> and you must have seen this illusion <unk> if i asked you what 's longer <unk> the vertical line on the table on the left <unk> or the horizontal
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 154.84 163.67 <NA> <unk> line on the table on the right <unk> which one seems longer <unk> can anybody see anything but the left one being longer no right it 's impossible
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 163.24 173.28 <NA> but the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes <unk> so i can put some lines on it doesn 't help i can animate the lines and to the extent you believe
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 173.23 179.43 <NA> <unk> i didn 't shrink the lines which i didn 't i 've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 179.84 186.12 <NA> <unk> interesting thing about this is when i take the lines away <unk> it 's as if you haven 't learned anything in the last minute <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 187.67 196.95 <NA> you can 't look at this and say now i see reality as it is right it 's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer our intuition is really <unk>
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 196.85 204.22 <NA> <unk> fooling us in a repeatable predictable consistent way and there is almost nothing we can do about it <unk> aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 205.65 214.84 <NA> <unk> 's another one it 's one of my favorite illusions <unk> what color is the top arrow pointing to audience brown dan ariely brown thank you the bottom one
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 214.47 217.1 <NA> yellow <unk> turns out they 're identical 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 217.1 225.02 <NA> can anybody see them as identical <unk> very very hard i can cover the rest of the cube up <unk> if i cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 231.19 236.75 <NA> but again it 's the same story that if we take the background away <unk> the illusion comes back
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 236.75 243.59 <NA> <unk> there is no way for us not to see this illusion i guess maybe if you 're colorblind i don 't think you can see that 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 243.22 245.88 <NA> i want you to think about illusion as a metaphor 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 245.88 254.97 <NA> vision is one of the best things we do we have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision bigger than dedicated to anything else <unk> we use our vision more hours of the day
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 255.1 263.02 <NA> than anything else <unk> we 're evolutionarily designed to use vision and if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision <unk> which we 're so good at 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 263.02 267.18 <NA> what are the chances we won 't make even more mistakes in something we 're not as good at 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 266.69 269.43 <NA> for example financial decision making 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 270.47 275.02 <NA> something we don 't have an evolutionary reason to do we don 't have a specialized part
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 275.4 283.76 <NA> <unk> and we don 't do that many hours of the day the argument is in those cases it might be that we actually make many more mistakes <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 283.52 293.74 <NA> and worse not having an easy way to see them because in visual illusions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes in cognitive illusion it 's much much harder to demonstrate the mistakes to people 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 293.74 295.7 <NA> so i want to show you some cognitive
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 298.64 304.43 <NA> in the same way <unk> and this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences <unk> it 's from
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 304.96 314.42 <NA> <unk> paper by johnson and goldstein it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 314.5 318.52 <NA> these are different countries in europe you basically see two types of countries 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 318.52 324.93 <NA> countries on the right that seem to be giving a lot and countries on the left that seem to giving very little or
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 325.1 330.69 <NA> <unk> much less the question is why why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 330.2 344.75 <NA> when you ask people this question they usually think that it has to be about culture how much do you care about people <unk> giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society how linked you are or maybe it 's about religion but if you look at this plot 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 344.75 349.75 <NA> you can see that countries that we think about as very similar <unk> actually exhibit very different
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 351.72 360.64 <NA> <unk> sweden is all the way on the right <unk> and denmark which we think is culturally very similar is all the way on the left germany is on the left <unk> and austria
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 360.64 368.8 <NA> is on the right <unk> the netherlands is on the left and belgium is on the right and finally depending on your particular version of
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 368.4 374.56 <NA> european similarity you can think about the u k and france as either similar culturally or not
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 374.31 379.94 <NA> <unk> but it turns out that with organ donation they are very different by the way the netherlands
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 379.93 388.78 <NA> <unk> an interesting story you see the netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group it turns out that they got to to twenty eight percent
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 388.79 395.45 <NA> after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 395.26 399.93 <NA> you know the expression begging only gets you so far it 's twenty eight percent in
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 403.28 408.93 <NA> <unk> but whatever the countries on the right are doing they 're doing a much better job than begging so what are they doing <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 408.62 412.44 <NA> turns out the secret has to do with a form at the dmv <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 412.21 413.74 <NA> and here is the story <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 413.74 422.62 <NA> the countries on the left have a form at the dmv that looks something like this check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 422.4 424.05 <NA> and what happens 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 423.56 425.11 <NA> people don 't check
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 425.25 426.79 <NA> <unk> and they don 't join <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 426.48 431.14 <NA> the countries on the right <unk> the ones that give a lot have a slightly different form 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 430.68 439.54 <NA> it says check the box below if you don 't want to participate interestingly enough when people get this they again don 't check <unk> but now they join 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 441.54 445.45 <NA> now think about what this means you
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 445.11 454.94 <NA> know we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions we wake up in the morning and we open the closet we feel that we decide what to wear we open the refrigerator and we feel that we
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 454.87 463.52 <NA> <unk> decide what to eat what this is actually saying is that many of these decisions are not residing within us <unk> they are residing in the person who is designing that form
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 463.32 470.51 <NA> when you walk into the dmv the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you 'll end up doing now
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 470.11 479.7 <NA> it 's also very hard to intuit these results think about it for yourself how many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow <unk> and you went to the dmv
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 479.87 484.74 <NA> <unk> and you encountered one of these forms that it would actually change your own behavior <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 484.28 491.79 <NA> very hard to think that it would influence us we can say oh these funny europeans of course it would influence them but when it comes to us <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 491.99 504.88 <NA> we have such a feeling that we 're in the driver 's seat such a feeling that we 're in control and we are making the decision that it 's very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision rather than an actual
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 504.81 508.36 <NA> <unk> decision <unk> now you might say 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 508.11 515.5 <NA> these are decisions we don 't care about in fact by definition these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 515.5 520.07 <NA> how could we care about something less than about something that happens after we die <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 519.86 529.88 <NA> so a standard economist somebody who believes in rationality would say you know what the cost of lifting the pencil and marking a v is higher than the possible benefit of the decision
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 529.89 532.25 <NA> so that 's why we get this effect 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 532.21 539.09 <NA> but in fact <unk> it 's not because it 's easy it 's not because it 's trivial <unk> it 's not because we don 't care it 's the opposite <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 539.09 551.48 <NA> it 's because we care <unk> it 's difficult and it 's complex and it 's so complex that we don 't know what to do <unk> and because we have no idea what to do <unk> we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us i 'll
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 551.14 554.61 <NA> give you one more example this is from a paper by redelmeier and
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 555.23 560.97 <NA> and they said would this effect also happens to experts people who are well paid 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 560.97 570.1 <NA> experts in their decisions and who make a lot of them and they took a group of physicians <unk> they presented to them a case study of a patient they said here is a patient

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 575 585.58 <NA> <unk> they said to the physicians you decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient all these medications nothing seems to be working so you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 590.07 599.92 <NA> then they said to half of the physicians yesterday you reviewed the patient 's case and you realized that you forgot to try one medication you did not try ibuprofen <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 599.55 604.94 <NA> what do you do do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen or do you let him go and have hip

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 605.68 611.45 <NA> well <unk> the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try ibuprofen <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 611.45 619.29 <NA> very good for the physicians to the other group of physicians they said <unk> yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn 't try out yet
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 619.11 629.79 <NA> ibuprofen and piroxicam you have two medications you didn 't try out yet what do you do you let him go <unk> or you pull him back and if you pull him back do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam which one
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 630.08 640.32 <NA> <unk> now think of it this decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement but pulling him back all of the sudden it becomes more complex there is one more decision <unk> 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 639.89 648.78 <NA> what happens now the majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go for a hip replacement <unk> i hope this worries you by the way 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 649.82 654.97 <NA> when you go to see your physician the thing is that no physician would ever say
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 655.25 665.65 <NA> <unk> piroxicam ibuprofen hip replacement let 's go for hip replacement but the moment you set this as the default it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing i 'll give you
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 665.76 675.2 <NA> a couple of more examples on irrational decision making imagine i give you a choice do you want to go for a weekend to rome all expenses paid hotel

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 705.32 714.81 <NA> <unk> but what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this what if it was a trip to rome all expenses paid transportation breakfast but it
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 714.47 720.6 <NA> doesn 't include coffee in the morning if you want coffee you have to pay for it yourself it 's two euros fifty 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 720.23 725.05 <NA> now in some ways <unk> given that you can have rome with coffee
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 725.31 730.63 <NA> <unk> why would you possibly want rome without coffee it 's like having your car stolen it 's an inferior option

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 738.28 746.65 <NA> the fact that you have rome without coffee makes rome with coffee look superior and not just to rome without coffee even superior to paris

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 752.17 757.13 <NA> this was an ad in the economist a few years ago that gave us three choices

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 767.59 774.87 <NA> now i looked at this and i called up the economist and i tried to figure out what they were thinking and they passed me from one person to

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 777.98 787.5 <NA> person who was in charge of the website and i called them up and they went to check what was going on the next thing i know the ad is gone no explanation <unk>
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 787.07 796.06 <NA> <unk> so i decided to do the experiment that <unk> i would have loved the economist to do with me <unk> i took this and i gave it to one hundred mit students <unk> i said what would you choose 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 796.06 797.68 <NA> these are the market shares
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 797.52 803.8 <NA> most people wanted the combo deal <unk> thankfully nobody wanted the dominant option that means our students can read

DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 809.64 817.6 <NA> so i printed another version of this where i eliminated the middle option i gave it to another one hundred students here is what happened 
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 817.14 822.91 <NA> now the most popular option became the least popular and the least popular became the most popular
DanAriely_2008P 1 DanAriely_2008P 822.63 829.88 <NA> <unk> what was happening was the option that was useless in the middle was useless in the sense that nobody
