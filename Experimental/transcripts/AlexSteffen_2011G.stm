AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 40.7 47.19 <NA> <unk> in front of us we tend to seek simple answers <unk> and i think this is what we 've done with climate change 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 54.99 62.14 <NA> <unk> out of fossil fuels that we 're burning so therefore the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy <unk> 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 61.95 74.62 <NA> and while of course we do need clean energy <unk> i would put to you that it 's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem we 're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 74.88 79.01 <NA> and the reason why is that we live on a planet that
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 79.54 81.35 <NA> <unk> rapidly urbanizing 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 81.15 88.59 <NA> that shouldn 't be news to any of us however it 's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 88.59 99.41 <NA> by mid century we 're going to have about eight billion perhaps more people living in cities or within a day 's travel of one we will be an overwhelmingly urban species <unk> 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 99.25 104.91 <NA> in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in

AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 113.33 119.49 <NA> it may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 119.09 125.08 <NA> so if we 're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 125.28 133.44 <NA> <unk> we need to look somewhere else for the solution the solution in fact may be closer to hand than we think because all of those cities we 're building
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 133.45 138.47 <NA> are opportunities <unk> every city determines to a very large extent
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 138.08 141.43 <NA> the amount of energy used by its inhabitants
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 141.2 153.76 <NA> we tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing i choose to turn this light switch on but really enormous amounts of our energy use are are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 153.76 154.97 <NA> i won 't show
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 154.96 167.38 <NA> <unk> you very many graphs today but if i can just focus on this one for a moment it really tells us a lot of what we need to know which is quite simply that if you look for example at transportation a major category of climate emissions 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 167.38 172.08 <NA> there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 171.87 179.91 <NA> and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air and the correlation of course is that denser places tend to
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 179.84 181.42 <NA> <unk> have lower emissions
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 181.24 185.79 <NA> which isn 't really all that difficult to figure out if you think about it basically
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 185.96 188.58 <NA> <unk> we substitute
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 188.57 198.67 <NA> <unk> in our lives access to the things we want we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place <unk> and we 're basically using mobility to get the access we need 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 198.67 199.99 <NA> but when we live in a denser
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 200.73 208.4 <NA> <unk> suddenly what we find of course is that the things we need are close by and since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 208.4 211.93 <NA> <unk> suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 211.5 223.34 <NA> and it is possible of course to increase the density of the communities around us some places are doing this with new eco districts developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods which is nice work if you can get it 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 223.34 229.64 <NA> but most of the time what we 're talking about is in fact <unk> reweaving the urban fabric that we already have so we 're talking about things like
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 230.14 235.75 <NA> <unk> development really sharp little changes to where we have buildings where we 're developing 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 235.76 241.83 <NA> urban retrofitting creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 241.59 246.62 <NA> increasingly we 're realizing that we don 't even need to densify an entire city 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 246.13 254.82 <NA> what we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don 't drive as much and so on and that can be done by
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 254.75 264.78 <NA> <unk> raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot so you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city <unk> 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 264.29 279.4 <NA> and we find that when we do that we can in fact have a few places that are really hyper dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results now we may find that there are places that are really really dense and still hold onto their cars
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 279.96 290.2 <NA> <unk> but the reality is that by and large what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect where people simply stop driving as much and increasingly more <unk>
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 290.1 301.6 <NA> <unk> and more people if they 're surrounded by places that make them feel at home give up their cars altogether and this is a huge huge energy savings because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 304.75 317.15 <NA> <unk> manufacture of the car the disposal of the car all of the parking and freeways and so on when you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn 't use any of them really you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as ninety percent <unk> 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 316.81 327.02 <NA> and people are embracing this all around the world we 're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life people are saying that it 's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood <unk> 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 326.59 329.94 <NA> and when you layer that over with the
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 329.87 340 <NA> <unk> kind of ubiquitous communications that we 're starting to see what you find is in fact <unk> even more access suffused into spaces some of it 's transportation access this is a
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 339.95 346.11 <NA> <unk> mapnificent map that shows me in this case how far i can get from my home in thirty minutes using public transportation 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 350 358.84 <NA> i asked how to do the greater ridgeway <unk> and it told me to go via guernsey it did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths though 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 360 369.58 <NA> but the technologies are getting better and we 're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation and as we just heard earlier of course we 're also learning how to put information on dumb objects things <unk>
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 369.48 375.29 <NA> <unk> that don 't have any wiring in them at all we 're learning how to include in these systems of notation
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 376.9 381.74 <NA> <unk> part of what we 're finding with this is that what we thought was the major

AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 385.09 394.95 <NA> <unk> which is to get a bunch of stuff is not in fact <unk> how we really live best in dense environments what we 're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 394.95 404.34 <NA> my favorite example is a drill who here owns a drill a home power drill <unk> okay <unk> i do too the average home power drill is used somewhere between six and twenty minutes in its entire lifetime
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 404.84 406.36 <NA> <unk> depending on who you ask 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 406.15 416.76 <NA> and so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit our cities <unk>
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 416.71 424.12 <NA> i would put to you are stockpiles of these surplus capacities and while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 429.93 437.11 <NA> <unk> that in fact <unk> turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them is a far smarter way to go 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 437.11 444.8 <NA> and in fact even space itself is turning into a service we 're finding that people can share the same spaces do stuff with vacant space 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 444.56 453.65 <NA> buildings are becoming bundles of services so we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on like heating cooling
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 454.99 465.17 <NA> <unk> things that we avoid spending energy on so we light our buildings with daylight we cool them with breezes we heat them with sunshine in fact when we use all these things what we 've found is that <unk>
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 465.12 472.29 <NA> in some cases energy use in a building can drop as much as ninety percent <unk> which brings on another threshold effect i like to call furnace dumping <unk> 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 480.02 488.97 <NA> <unk> than the alternatives now when we look at being able to slash our our product use slash our transportation use slash
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 488.77 497.2 <NA> our our building energy use all of that is great but it still leaves something behind <unk> and if we 're going to really truly become sustainable cities we need to think a little differently 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 497.2 502.06 <NA> this is one way to do it this is vancouver 's propaganda about how green a city they are 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 501.87 504.58 <NA> and certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 504.78 515.06 <NA> <unk> sustainable city is covered in greenery so we have visions like this we have visions like this we have visions like this now all of these are fine projects but they really have
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 515.06 524.78 <NA> missed an essential point which is it 's not about the leaves above it 's about the systems below <unk> do they for instance capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 525.52 526.83 <NA> <unk> energy intensive 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 526.62 537.28 <NA> do they perhaps include green infrastructure so that we can take runoff and water that 's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 537.29 544.07 <NA> do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by for example connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 543.64 551.51 <NA> do they allow for pollination <unk> pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 551.51 554.94 <NA> do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 554.9 559.2 <NA> <unk> and fiber and so forth <unk> and turn it back into soil
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 558.98 564.72 <NA> and sequester carbon take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 564.72 569.04 <NA> i would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible they 're being done right now <unk> 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 568.64 571.29 <NA> and that it 's a darn good thing 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 570.92 575.14 <NA> because right now our economy by and large operates as paul hawken
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 575.7 580.24 <NA> <unk> by stealing the future <unk> selling it in the present and calling it gdp 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 580.17 591.71 <NA> and if we have another eight billion or seven billion or six billion even people living on a planet where their cities also steal the future <unk> we 're going to run out of future really fast <unk> 
AlexSteffen_2011G 1 AlexSteffen_2011G 591.71 600.02 <NA> but if we think differently <unk> i think that in fact we can have cities that are not only zero emissions <unk> but have unlimited possibilities as well
