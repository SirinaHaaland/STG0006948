CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 20.78 24.11 <NA> and so i guess there 's a little bit of irony to it <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 23.68 25.08 <NA> i will say though that
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 25.04 27.3 <NA> <unk> after having done surgery a lot <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 26.93 36.58 <NA> it 's similar to playing a musical instrument and for me <unk> this deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and to study the science of sound particularly music
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 36.4 41.43 <NA> i 'm going to talk over the next few minutes about about my career in terms of how i 'm able
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 41.43 47.04 <NA> to study music and try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 46.73 54.91 <NA> i 've done most of this work at johns hopkins university and at the national institute of health where i was previously i 'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 54.96 62.38 <NA> i will start off by playing a video for you this video is of keith jarrett who 's a well known jazz improviser and probably the most well known 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 62.38 69.56 <NA> iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a higher level and he 'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 69.33 72.38 <NA> and he 'll never play it exactly the same way again <unk> so
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 72.2 75.02 <NA> as a form of intense creativity i think this is a great example
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 100 129.94 <NA> the
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 137.49 142.91 <NA> <unk> i 've always as a listener as a fan i listen to that and i 'm astounded i think how can this possibly be 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 142.91 150.02 <NA> how can the brain generate that much information that much music <unk> spontaneously <unk> and so i set out with this concept scientifically that
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 151.51 158.84 <NA> <unk> it 's magical but it 's not magic <unk> meaning that it 's a product of the brain there 's not too many brain dead people creating art <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 158.41 164.97 <NA> with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product <unk> i took this thesis that we could study it
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 164.75 168.26 <NA> just like we study any other complex neurologic process and <unk>
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 169.29 175.11 <NA> i put there is it possible to study creativity scientifically and i think that 's a good question and i 'll tell you that most
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 177.65 186.28 <NA> <unk> they 're very dense and when you go through them it 's very hard to recognize the music in it in fact they seem to be unmusical entirely and to miss the point of the music
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 186.28 192.36 <NA> this brings the second question why should scientists study creativity maybe we 're not the right people to do it well
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 192.5 200.05 <NA> it may be <unk> but i will say that from a scientific perspective we talked a lot about innovation today the science of innovation
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 200.25 203.86 <NA> <unk> how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 203.85 215.72 <NA> and truly we know very little about how we are able to be creative i think that we 're going to see over the next ten twenty thirty years a real science of creativity that 's burgeoning and is going to flourish because we now have new methods that can
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 215.24 220.55 <NA> enable us to take this process like complex jazz improvisation and study it rigorously <unk>
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 220.55 228.34 <NA> so it gets down to the brain <unk> all of us have this remarkable brain which is poorly understood to say the least i think that

CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 229.87 239.68 <NA> <unk> have more questions than answers and <unk> i 'm not going to give you answers today just ask a lot of questions and that 's what i do in my lab i ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 239.52 242.59 <NA> this is the main method that i use this is functional mri 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 242.59 251.58 <NA> if you 've been in an mri scanner it 's very much the same but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain <unk>
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 252.3 254.97 <NA> the way that 's done is by the following there 's something called bold

CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 258.74 264.15 <NA> when you 're in an fmri scanner you 're in a big magnet that 's aligning your molecules in certain areas 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 263.81 272.7 <NA> when an area of the brain is active <unk> meaning a neural area is active it gets blood flow shunted to that area that blood flow causes an increase
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 272.42 279.97 <NA> in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by mri whereas

CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 281.3 295.96 <NA> so through this method of inference and we 're measuring blood flow not neural activity we say that an area of the brain that 's getting more blood was active during a particular task and that 's the crux of how fmri works <unk> and it 's been used since the ' 90s to study really complex processes
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 295.96 299.93 <NA> i 'm going to review a study that i did which was jazz in an fmri scanner

CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 395.6 404.79 <NA> i have here what we call the paradigms there 's a scale paradigm which is playing a scale up and down memorized then there 's improvising on a scale quarter notes metronome right hand
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 405.02 409.02 <NA> scientifically very safe <unk> but musically really boring
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 409.02 418.42 <NA> then there 's the bottom one which is called the jazz paradigm so we brought professional jazz players to the nih and we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower left which is what you heard me playing
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 418.25 425.02 <NA> and we had them improvise to the same chord changes <unk> and if you can hit that <unk> lower right sound icon that 's an example of what was recorded in

CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 461.38 473.21 <NA> the musicians were comfortable in the end <unk> we first measured the number of notes were they playing more notes when they were improvising <unk> that was not what was going on and then we looked at the brain activity i will try to condense this for you 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 473.29 475.08 <NA> these are contrast maps
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 475.04 485.11 <NA> <unk> that are showing subtractions between what changes when you 're improvising vs when you 're doing something memorized in red is an area that 's active in the prefrontal cortex the frontal lobe of the brain <unk> and in blue is this

CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 521.49 529.88 <NA> it 's one study it 's probably wrong but it 's one study we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that to be creative
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 529.98 542.03 <NA> should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe <unk> one area turns on and a big area shuts off so that you 're not inhibited you 're willing to make mistakes so that you 're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses 
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 541.72 543.23 <NA> now
CharlesLimb_2010X 1 CharlesLimb_2010X 542.95 550.11 <NA> a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity sometimes it 's done communicatively <unk> the next question was what happens when
