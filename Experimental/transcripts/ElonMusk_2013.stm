ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 21.4 28.74 <NA> musk well it goes back to when i was in in university <unk> i thought about what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 28.51 29.82 <NA> or the future of humanity
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 30.14 42.42 <NA> <unk> i think it 's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century <unk> independent of environmental concerns
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 42.02 51.46 <NA> in fact <unk> even if producing co2 was good for the environment given that we 're going to run out of hydrocarbons <unk> we need to find some sustainable means of
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 54.69 62.95 <NA> <unk> electricity comes from burning fossil fuels <unk> how can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help em 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 62.49 63.64 <NA> right
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 63.64 74.84 <NA> there 's two elements to that answer one is that <unk> even if you take the same source fuel and and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars you 're still better off <unk> so if you take say natural
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 79.18 84.99 <NA> <unk> if you burn that in a modern general electric natural gas turbine you 'll get about sixty percent efficiency <unk> 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 84.99 89.63 <NA> if you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car you get about twenty percent efficiency <unk> 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 89.17 93.95 <NA> and the reason is in the stationary power plant you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 93.52 99.84 <NA> is voluminous <unk> and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source <unk> 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 101.12 109.87 <NA> <unk> even after you 've taken transmission loss into account and everything even using the same source fuel you 're at least twice as better off charging an electric car then burning it at the power plant ca 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 109.87 112.03 <NA> that scale delivers efficiency em 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 111.84 124.87 <NA> yes <unk> it does and then the other point is <unk> we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway electricity generation so given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation then it makes sense for us to have electric
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 126.51 134.56 <NA> <unk> as the mode of transport ca so we 've got some video here of of the tesla being assembled which if we could play that that first video
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 134.58 139.88 <NA> so what what is innovative about this process in this vehicle em 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 139.64 141 <NA> sure <unk> so 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 141 149.8 <NA> in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport and i should say that i think actually all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets

ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 156.88 166.73 <NA> question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport and in order to do that for cars <unk> you have to come up with a really energy efficient car so that means making it incredibly <unk>
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 166.63 178.89 <NA> <unk> light and so what you 're seeing here is the only <unk> all aluminum body and chassis car made in north america in fact we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack <unk> 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 179.93 183.21 <NA> <unk> drag coefficient of any car of its size so
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 183.08 185.91 <NA> as a result the energy usage is very low <unk> 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 185.91 196.69 <NA> and it has the most advanced battery pack <unk> and that 's what gives it the range that that 's competitive so you can actually have on the order of a 250 mile range ca i mean <unk> those battery packs are incredibly
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 196.5 204.4 <NA> heavy but you think the math the math can still work out intelligently by combining light body heavy battery you can still gain spectacular efficiency
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 204.75 213.13 <NA> <unk> exactly <unk> the rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack <unk> and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range and in fact
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 213.69 224.87 <NA> customers of the model s are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range <unk> i think somebody recently got four hundred and twenty miles out of a single charge <unk> ca bruno bowden who 's
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 228.73 235.22 <NA> <unk> that was the good news the bad news was that to do it he had to drive at eighteen miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 236.44 240.8 <NA> em i mean <unk> you can certainly drive
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 240.73 245.58 <NA> if you drive it sixty five miles an hour <unk> under normal conditions 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 245.58 253.17 <NA> two hundred and fifty miles is a reasonable number ca let 's show that second video showing the tesla in action on ice not at all a dig at the new york times
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 254.63 264.75 <NA> <unk> surprising thing about the experience of driving the car em in creating an electric car <unk> the responsiveness of the car <unk> is really incredible so we wanted really to have people feel as though
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 264.75 271.29 <NA> they 've almost got to mind meld with the car so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one and as you as you
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 270.86 274.84 <NA> corner and accelerate it just happens like the car has <unk>
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 275.76 280.09 <NA> <unk> you can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness you can 't do that with a gasoline car
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 279.99 285.97 <NA> i think that that 's really a profound difference and people only experience that when they have a test drive ca i mean this is a
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 285.97 293.26 <NA> beautiful but expensive car is there a road map where this becomes a <unk>
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 295.85 299.96 <NA> the goal of tesla has always been to have a sort of three step process
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 300.07 304.55 <NA> <unk> where version one was an expensive car at low volume version two is
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 304.09 314.33 <NA> medium priced and medium volume <unk> and then version three would be low price high volume so we 're at step two at this point <unk> so we had a $ one hundred thousand sports car which was the roadster then we 've got the model s <unk>
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 314.28 320.25 <NA> which starts at around fifty thousand dollars and our third generation car which should hopefully be out in about three or four years
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 329.95 341.46 <NA> and so i think we 're making progress in that direction and i feel confident that we 'll get there ca i mean right now if you 've got a short commute you can drive you can get back you can charge it at home
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 341.33 350.4 <NA> <unk> there isn 't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast do you see that coming really truly or just on a few key routes 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 350.45 354.46 <NA> em there actually are far more charging stations than people realize
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 355.17 356.65 <NA> and
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 356.25 360.1 <NA> at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 360.36 367.45 <NA> and we 're offering that if you if you buy a model s for free <unk> forever <unk> and so this is something that maybe a lot of people don 't realize
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 367.05 371.9 <NA> <unk> we actually have california and nevada covered and we 've got the
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 371.71 375.02 <NA> eastern seaboard from boston to d c covered by

ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 384.69 399.18 <NA> and the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop to stop time of about six or seven <unk> so if you drive for three hours <unk> you want to stop for twenty or thirty minutes because that 's normally what people will stop for so if you start
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 399.02 404.25 <NA> a trip at nine a m by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat hit the restroom coffee and keep going
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 404.81 417.84 <NA> <unk> proposition to consumers is for the full charge it could take take an hour <unk> so it 's common don 't expect to be out of here in ten minutes wait for an hour but the good news is you 're helping save the planet and by the way the electricity is free <unk> you don 't pay anything em 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 417.84 423.48 <NA> actually what we 're expecting is <unk> for people to stop for about twenty to thirty minutes not for an hour
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 423.29 426.78 <NA> <unk> it 's actually better to to drive for

ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 439.26 445.72 <NA> this is only one string to your energy bow you 've been working on on this solar company solarcity what 's
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 445.53 454.58 <NA> unusual about that em well as i mentioned earlier we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 454.89 458.76 <NA> i 'm quite confident that the primary means
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 458.58 463.7 <NA> of power generation will be solar <unk> i mean it 's really indirect fusion is what it is we
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 463.63 467.24 <NA> 've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 466.96 476.19 <NA> <unk> and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization what most people know but don 't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 479.87 482.79 <NA> <unk> be a frozen ice ball at three degrees kelvin

ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 486.91 489.75 <NA> the whole ecosystem is solar powered ca 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 489.75 499.99 <NA> but in a gallon of gasoline you have effectively thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space so it 's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar and to remotely
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 524.88 529.34 <NA> <unk> you can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system most people choose to lease
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 530.07 536.84 <NA> <unk> and the thing about solar power is that it doesn 't have any feed stock or operational costs so once it 's installed 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 536.35 541.76 <NA> it 's just there it works for decades it 'll work for probably a century
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 541.27 549.99 <NA> <unk> so therefore the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low <unk> and then get the cost of the financing low <unk>
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 550.76 558.43 <NA> <unk> because that interest those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar and we 've made huge progress in that direction and that 's why i 'm
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 558.25 566 <NA> confident we 'll actually beat natural gas ca so your current proposition to consumers is <unk> don 't pay so much up front
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 566 573.13 <NA> <unk> em zero ca pay zero up front <unk> we will install panels on your roof <unk> you will then pay 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 572.89 574.89 <NA> how long is a typical lease 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 580.59 586.96 <NA> <unk> as you 're sort of alluding to quite straightforward it 's no money down and your utility your utility bill decreases
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 587.1 595.27 <NA> pretty good deal ca so that seems like a win for the consumer no risk <unk> you 'll pay less than you 're paying now for you the dream here then is that
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 595.27 599.93 <NA> i mean who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 616.63 619.01 <NA> <unk> google is one of our big partners here
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 618.55 627.18 <NA> and they have an expected return on that capital with that capital solarcity purchases and installs the panel on on the roof and then charges the
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 627.18 629.94 <NA> homeowner or business owner a monthly lease
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 629.9 633.85 <NA> <unk> payment <unk> which is less than the utility bill ca but you yourself get
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 633.67 639.67 <NA> a <unk> long term commercial benefit from that power you 're kind of building a new type of distributed utility 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 639.67 644.43 <NA> em exactly what it amounts to is a giant distributed utility <unk>
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 644.45 648.03 <NA> i think it 's a good thing because utilities
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 647.63 653.25 <NA> have been this monopoly <unk> and people haven 't had any choice so effectively it 's the first time
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 653.3 654.94 <NA> there 's been competition
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 654.93 664.45 <NA> <unk> for this monopoly <unk> because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines but now it 's on your roof so i think it 's actually very empowering for
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 664.23 673.97 <NA> homeowners and businesses ca and you really picture a future where a majority of power in america <unk> within a decade or two or within
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 679.93 686.09 <NA> <unk> least a plurality of power and most likely a majority <unk> and
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 685.6 694.71 <NA> i predict it will be a plurality in less than twenty years <unk> <unk> i made that bet with someone ca definition of plurality is em more from solar than any other source

ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 710.4 719.85 <NA> i think we 'll see more power from solar than any other source ca all right <unk> so let 's go back to another bet that you made with yourself i guess a kind of crazy bet you 'd made some money
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 719.45 724.84 <NA> from the sale of paypal <unk> you decided to build a space
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 733.47 737.39 <NA> <unk> you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 755.41 764.39 <NA> <unk> it was a close call things almost didn 't work out <unk> we came very close to failure <unk> but we managed to get through that point in two thousand and eight <unk> the

ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 808.23 816.61 <NA> a humanity that is a space faring civilization that 's out there exploring the stars on multiple planets <unk> and i think that 's really exciting 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 816.18 828.56 <NA> compared with with one where we are forever confined to earth until some eventual extinction event ca so you 've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by seventy five percent depending on how you calculate it how on earth have you done that
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 830.02 838.94 <NA> <unk> been doing this for years how have you done this em well we 've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe the engines the electronics
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 838.96 845.24 <NA> and the launch operation <unk> <unk> there 's a long list of of innovations that that we 've come up with there
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 845.11 850.05 <NA> that are a little difficult to communicate in in this talk but
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 858.74 868.29 <NA> <unk> you think it 's more dangerous to patent than not to patent em since our primary competitors are national governments <unk> the enforceability of patents is questionable ca that 's
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 869.21 871.14 <NA> really really interesting
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 872.69 877.9 <NA> but the big the big innovation is still ahead and you 're working on it now tell us about this
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 879.96 888.61 <NA> <unk> ca in fact let 's roll that video and you can you can talk us through it what 's happening here em absolutely <unk> so the thing about rockets is that
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 888.61 900.05 <NA> they 're all expendable all rockets that fly today are fully expendable the space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time <unk> and the parts that were reusable took
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 902.47 907.79 <NA> <unk> nine months to refurbish for flight <unk> so the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 907.72 912.53 <NA> obviously that doesn 't work very well for ca what just happened there we just saw something land em 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 912.91 914.72 <NA> that 's right so
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 914.62 923.76 <NA> it 's important that the the rocket stages be able to come back to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 931.28 941.4 <NA> <unk> realize is the cost of the fuel of the propellant is very small it 's much like on a jet <unk> so the cost of the of the propellant is about 3 percent of the cost of the rocket <unk> 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 941.21 949.86 <NA> so it 's possible to achieve let 's say roughly 100 fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 949.46 954.91 <NA> that 's why it 's so important every mode of transport that we use whether it 's planes trains automobiles
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 954.84 958.31 <NA> <unk> bikes horses is reusable <unk> but not rockets <unk> 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 958.31 965.41 <NA> so we must solve this problem in order to become a space faring civilization ca you asked me the question earlier of how popular
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 965.25 970.57 <NA> traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward em certain cruises are apparently highly problematic 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 972.87 974.87 <NA> ca definitely more
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 976.18 978.45 <NA> <unk> so that 's potentially absolutely disruptive
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 978.24 983.57 <NA> technology and i guess paves the way for your dream to actually take at
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 983.83 990.14 <NA> some point to take humanity to mars at scale you 'd like to see a colony on mars em 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 990.28 999.96 <NA> yeah exactly spacex or some combination of companies and and governments needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi planetary of establishing

ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 1004.81 1010.01 <NA> and then building that that base up until we 're a true <unk> multi planet species ca so
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 1009.81 1017.48 <NA> progress on this let 's make it reusable how is that going that was just a simulation video we saw how 's it going em 
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 1017.14 1025.65 <NA> we 're actually <unk> we 've been making some good progress recently with something we call the grasshopper test project where we 're testing the vertical landing
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 1025.49 1029.91 <NA> portion of of the flight the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky
ElonMusk_2013 1 ElonMusk_2013 1030.35 1034.38 <NA> and we 've had some good tests ca can we see that em yeah so that
