DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 916.93 919.91 <NA> well on the panpsychist view 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 919.63 929.97 <NA> you can leave the equations of physics as they are but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness that 's what physics really is ultimately doing describing the flux of consciousness
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 930.01 934.89 <NA> on this view it 's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations <unk> 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 935.6 943.32 <NA> on that view consciousness doesn 't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra <unk> it 's there right at its heart 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 944.21 949.66 <NA> this view i think the <unk> panpsychist view has the potential to transfigure our
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 952.23 955.93 <NA> <unk> and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 955.44 961.48 <NA> consequences some of these may be counterintuitive i used to think
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 961.48 968.42 <NA> i shouldn 't eat anything which is conscious <unk> so therefore i should be vegetarian <unk> now <unk>
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 969.47 975.08 <NA> and you take that view you 're going to go very hungry <unk> so i think when you think about it this
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 976.54 982.1 <NA> <unk> your views whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations not so much the fact
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 981.93 987.11 <NA> of consciousness <unk> but the degree and the complexity of consciousness <unk> 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 987.25 992.24 <NA> it 's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems like computers 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 992.24 996.95 <NA> what about the artificially intelligent system in the movie her samantha 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 997.3 1000.08 <NA> is she conscious <unk> well if you take
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1002.05 1005.3 <NA> <unk> she certainly has complicated information processing
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1005.13 1006.73 <NA> and integration <unk> 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1006.51 1010.68 <NA> so the answer is very likely yes <unk> she is conscious <unk> if that 's right 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1010.68 1020.57 <NA> it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off <unk> 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1020.8 1024.81 <NA> finally you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups <unk>
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1027.14 1028.3 <NA> <unk> does canada
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1028.12 1031.9 <NA> have its own consciousness <unk> or at a more local level <unk> 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1031.9 1039.18 <NA> does an integrated group like the audience at a ted conference are we right now having a collective ted consciousness
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1039.08 1041.91 <NA> an inner movie for this
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1041.91 1049.93 <NA> collective ted group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts i don 't know the answer to that question but i think it 's at least one worth
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1056.52 1058.3 <NA> <unk> i don 't know that it 's correct <unk> 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1057.99 1064.1 <NA> i 'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1064.1 1068.08 <NA> than about the second one that it 's universal i
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1067.95 1074.9 <NA> mean the view raises any number of questions has any number of challenges like how do those little bits of consciousness add up
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1075.13 1078.83 <NA> <unk> to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love <unk> 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1079.15 1085.49 <NA> if we can answer those questions then i think we 're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness <unk> 
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1085.27 1094.07 <NA> if not well this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy we can 't expect to solve it overnight but
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1094.06 1103.26 <NA> i do think we 're going to figure it out eventually understanding consciousness is a real key i think both to understanding the universe
DavidChalmers_2014 1 DavidChalmers_2014 1103.02 1108.42 <NA> and to understanding ourselves it may just take the right crazy idea
