DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 116.18 124.84 <NA> so why is that a good example <unk> that 's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a

DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 159.72 166.52 <NA> even more amusingly and on my debit card too we print the name and the salt code and everything else on the front too <unk> why
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 166.48 173.54 <NA> there is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and pin card <unk> and if you think about it it
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 173.53 179.82 <NA> 's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 180.1 183.39 <NA> are criminals <unk> you know what your name is <unk> right 
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 183.08 186.99 <NA> and when you go into a shop and buy something <unk> it 's a pin he doesn 't

DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 209.28 217.93 <NA> so if you drop your card in the street it means a criminal can pick it up and read it they know the name from the name they can find the address <unk> and then they can go off and buy stuff online <unk> 
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 217.93 229.94 <NA> why do we put the name on the card <unk> because we think identity is something to do with names <unk> and because we 're rooted in the idea of the identity card which obsesses us and i know it
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 229.87 230.99 <NA> <unk> crashed and burned
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 230.82 233.39 <NA> a couple of years ago but if you 're

DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 244.14 246.66 <NA> so the second example i thought i 'd use
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 246.45 247.61 <NA> is

DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 264.83 271.6 <NA> for the moment why do i use that picture because that was very interesting <unk> watching that experience as an old person <unk>
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 271.6 279.85 <NA> <unk> so him and his friends they get together <unk> they booked a room like a church hall <unk> and they got all their friends who had bands and they got them together <unk> and they do it all on

DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 300 308.69 <NA> bottom of the menu they were like fifth i thought they had no chance he actually got twenty quid fantastic right <unk> but my point is that all worked perfectly except
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 308.62 317.51 <NA> on the web so they 're sitting on facebook and they 're sending these messages and arranging things and they don 't know who anybody is <unk> right <unk> 
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 317.11 324.96 <NA> that 's the big problem we 're trying to solve if only they were using the real names <unk> then you wouldn 't be worried about them on the internet <unk> and so when he says to me oh <unk> i want to go
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 330.95 339.12 <NA> <unk> you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars because they might not all be your friends and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be

DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 358.29 368.57 <NA> but of course if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name i 'd say no you can 't give them your real name because what happens if they turn out to be perverts and teachers and whatever
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 368.36 377.63 <NA> so you have this odd sort of paradox where i 'm happy for him to go into this space if i know who everybody else is <unk> but i don 't want anybody else to know who he is <unk> 
DavidBirch_2012X 1 DavidBirch_2012X 377.63 379.97 <NA> and so you get this sort of logjam around identity
