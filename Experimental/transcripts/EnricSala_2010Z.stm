EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 36.98 42.87 <NA> in the mediterranean coast off spain now if an alien came to earth

EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 45.02 54.79 <NA> what would joe see if joe jumped in a coral reef there are many things the alien could see very unlikely joe would

EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 488.58 496.06 <NA> if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby this is what happens the number of species increases twenty one percent so if you have one thousand species
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 495.9 504.88 <NA> you would expect two hundred more in a marine reserve this is very substantial <unk> the size of organisms increases a third so your fish are now this big
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 505.26 513.44 <NA> the abundance how many fish you have per square meter increases almost one hundred and seventy percent and the biomass this is the most spectacular change
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 513.44 520.75 <NA> four point five times greater biomass on average just after five to seven years in some places up to ten times
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 520.26 529.94 <NA> larger biomass inside the reserves <unk> so we have all these things inside the reserve that grow and what do they do they reproduce
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 530.01 535.27 <NA> that 's population biology one hundred and one if you don 't kill the fish they take a longer time to die <unk> they grow larger
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 535.11 543.53 <NA> and they reproduce a lot and same thing for invertebrates this is the example these are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of chile <unk> 
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 543.28 549.63 <NA> and this is how many eggs they they lay on the bottom outside the reserve you cannot even detect this

EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 562.03 568.33 <NA> spill over they all spill over <unk> and then people can benefit from them outside too this is in the bahamas nassau grouper <unk> 
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 568.33 574.17 <NA> huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve and the closer you get to the reserve <unk> the more fish you have 
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 573.74 579.43 <NA> so the fishermen are catching more you can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 579.93 585.16 <NA> so there is spill over there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help

EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 840.61 849.93 <NA> there are three main reasons why we don 't have tens of thousands of small reserves the first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 850.76 858.06 <NA> <unk> and fishermen tend to be really really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area <unk> even if it 's small 
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 857.69 864.04 <NA> second the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don 't have the authority
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 863.62 870.45 <NA> to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it it 's a top down hierarchical structure where people
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 870.45 875.05 <NA> wait for government agents to to come and this is not effective and the government doesn
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 875 877.63 <NA> <unk> have enough resources which takes us to the third
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 877.17 885.97 <NA> reason why we don 't have many more reserves is that the funding models have been wrong ngos and governments
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 885.75 891.88 <NA> spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas usually <unk> 
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 891.66 898.48 <NA> so marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money and this is not sustainable
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 898.17 904.97 <NA> <unk> so the solutions are just fixing these three issues first we need to develop a global awareness

EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 908.86 917.33 <NA> to create no take reserves that are better than what we have now it 's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits <unk> 
EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 917.35 921.12 <NA> second <unk> we need to redesign our governance so

EnricSala_2010Z 1 EnricSala_2010Z 1074.55 1079.97 <NA> we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently ca so the numbers you presented
