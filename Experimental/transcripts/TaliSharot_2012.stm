TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 934.97 941.13 <NA> so they have adjusted the two thousand and twelve olympic budget for the optimism bias <unk> 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 941.15 945.58 <NA> my friend who 's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 945.58 952.17 <NA> and by the way when i asked him about his own likelihood of divorce he said he was quite sure it was zero percent
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 952.76 954.88 <NA> so what we would really like to do
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 954.87 959.6 <NA> <unk> is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism <unk> 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 959.6 965.44 <NA> but at the same time remain hopeful <unk> benefiting from the many fruits of optimism <unk> 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 965.19 968.38 <NA> and i believe there 's a way for us to do that 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 968.38 977.59 <NA> the key here really is knowledge we 're not born with an innate understanding of our biases these have to be identified by scientific investigation <unk> 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 977.34 979.88 <NA> but the good news is that becoming
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 979.84 992.93 <NA> <unk> aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion it 's like visual illusions in which understanding them does not make them go away <unk> and this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 992.93 1000.29 <NA> to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism but at the same time remain hopeful
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1001.42 1002.93 <NA> <unk> i think this
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1002.5 1005.46 <NA> cartoon portrays it nicely because
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1005.28 1012.8 <NA> if you 're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly you certainly never will 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1012.4 1020.78 <NA> because to make any kind of progress we need to be able to imagine a different reality <unk> and then we need to believe that that reality is possible <unk> 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1020.56 1025.08 <NA> but if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1025 1031.11 <NA> down blindly hoping for the best you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground <unk> 
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1031.31 1037.98 <NA> but if you 're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly but then adjusts a parachute to your back
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1037.55 1045.6 <NA> just in case things don 't work out exactly as you had planned you will soar like an eagle <unk> even if you 're just a penguin
TaliSharot_2012 1 TaliSharot_2012 1045.57 1046.57 <NA> thank you
