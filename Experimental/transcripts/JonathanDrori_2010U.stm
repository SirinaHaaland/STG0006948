JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 14.11 17.57 <NA> <unk> have two missions here today the first is to
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 17.14 26.52 <NA> tell you something about pollen i hope <unk> and to convince you that it 's more than just something that gets up your nose and secondly to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 29.99 33.08 <NA> <unk> is a flower 's way of making more flowers 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 33.08 41.65 <NA> it carries male sex cells from one flower to another this gives us genetic diversity or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 41.42 47.7 <NA> and it 's really rather better not to mate with yourself that 's probably true of humans as well mostly
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 48.83 54.97 <NA> <unk> pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers <unk> each anther can carry up to one hundred thousand grains
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 54.99 56.17 <NA> <unk> of pollen <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 56.37 58.37 <NA> so it 's quite prolific stuff <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 58.37 67.45 <NA> and it isn 't just bright flowers that have pollen it 's also trees and grasses and remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 69.09 77.2 <NA> here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen the little hole in the middle we 'll come to a bit later but that 's for
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 76.71 79.97 <NA> the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 79.9 82.85 <NA> <unk> tube so that 's twenty micrometers across that
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 82.85 91.61 <NA> pollen grain there that 's about a 50th of a millimeter but not all pollen is quite so simple looking this is morina this is a
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 91.48 100.2 <NA> plant which i 've always thought to be rather tedious named after morin <unk> who was an enterprising french gardener who issued the first seed catalog
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 106.19 117.69 <NA> this is amazing i think that little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another morina flower just on the right species what happens 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 117.47 121.5 <NA> like i said pollen carries the male sex cells if you
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 121.79 128.74 <NA> actually didn 't realize that plants have sex they have rampant promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex really
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 132.03 136.64 <NA> my story is actually not about plant propagation <unk> but about pollen itself 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 136.64 139.6 <NA> so what are pollen 's properties i hear you ask 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 139.23 148.45 <NA> first of all pollen is tiny <unk> yes we know that it 's also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand now pollen from plants which are <unk>
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 149.54 154.97 <NA> like trees and grasses and so on tend to cause the most hay fever and the reason for
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 154.96 166.45 <NA> <unk> that is they 've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species <unk> here are some examples they 're very smooth if you look at them of tree pollen that
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 166.29 168.8 <NA> is meant to be carried by the wind <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 169.33 177.93 <NA> again this time sycamore wind dispersed so trees very boring flowers <unk> not really trying to attract insects
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 180.59 190.65 <NA> <unk> this one i particularly like this is the monterey pine which has little air sacks to make the pollen carry even further remember that thing is just about thirty micrometers across <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 190.7 196.8 <NA> now it 's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding <unk> this is a bee 's leg
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 196.85 200.11 <NA> with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 201.06 210.35 <NA> <unk> and this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm very showy to attract lots of insects to do its bidding the pollen has little barbs on it 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 210.35 211.69 <NA> if we look 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 211.59 214.81 <NA> now <unk> those little barbs
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 214.56 217.12 <NA> obviously stick to the insects well
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 216.84 224.38 <NA> <unk> but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this if it was the earth 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 224.4 229.97 <NA> that tells me that it 's actually been fossilized this pollen and i 'm rather proud to say that this was found just near london
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 230.19 235.85 <NA> and that fifty five million years ago london was full of mangroves isn 't that cool 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 239.41 245.12 <NA> okay so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects you can tell that from the little barbs on there 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 246.07 249.99 <NA> all these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope actually in the lab
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 251.48 258.39 <NA> <unk> no coincidence that these were taken by rob kesseler who is an artist and i think it 's someone with a design and artistic eye
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 257.9 263.13 <NA> like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen now 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 264.02 268.51 <NA> all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 268.34 273.36 <NA> and tell what species it came from <unk> and that 's actually quite handy if you
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 273.17 279.73 <NA> maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from <unk> so different species of plants grow in different places
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 280.11 283.57 <NA> <unk> and some pollen carries further than others <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 284.28 290.86 <NA> so <unk> if you have a pollen sample then in principle you should be able to tell where that sample came from <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 291.09 294.34 <NA> and this is where it gets interesting for forensics 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 295.44 300.1 <NA> pollen is tiny it gets on to things and it sticks to them 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 300.49 304.58 <NA> <unk> not only does each type of pollen look different but each habitat has a different
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 304.57 310.67 <NA> combination of plants a different pollen signature if you like or a different pollen fingerprint 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 312.43 317.55 <NA> by looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 317.55 320.78 <NA> you can tell very precisely where it came from 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 321.7 329.82 <NA> this is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt similar to the one that i 'm wearing now <unk> now much of the pollen will still be there after repeated
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 329.75 332.85 <NA> <unk> washings where has it been <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 333.53 339.06 <NA> four very different habitats might look similar but they 've got very different pollen signatures 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 338.6 345.1 <NA> actually this one is particularly easy these pictures were all taken in different countries <unk> but pollen forensics can be very subtle it
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 345.1 349.42 <NA> 's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 349.23 351.54 <NA> where banknotes have come from 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 351.44 354.97 <NA> to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 354.9 358.09 <NA> <unk> really did come from the place the seller said they did 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 358.41 370.36 <NA> and murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing certainly in the u k to within an area that 's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim <unk> 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 369.87 375.2 <NA> so you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 375.97 380 <NA> <unk> where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs 
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 380.5 387.89 <NA> and finally in a rather grizzly way the bosnia war crimes some of the people brought to trial
JonathanDrori_2010U 1 JonathanDrori_2010U 387.43 395.85 <NA> were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen which showed that bodies had been buried exhumed and then reburied somewhere else
