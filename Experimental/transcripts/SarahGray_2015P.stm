SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 153.49 157.91 <NA> but they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 157.78 163.28 <NA> this helped me see thomas in a new light <unk> as opposed to just a victim of a disease <unk>

SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 244.9 247.88 <NA> and was it even worthwhile to donate
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 250.01 258.63 <NA> <unk> invited ross and i to a grief retreat <unk> and we met about fifteen other grieving families who had donated their loved one 's organs for transplant

SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 287.7 294.4 <NA> but over the years that followed <unk> i learned a lot more about donation <unk> and i even got a job in the field <unk> 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 294.4 296.41 <NA> and i came up with an idea <unk> 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 297.39 299.87 <NA> i wrote a letter that started out dear
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 302.41 310.19 <NA> <unk> i explained who i was <unk> and i asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas in march of two thousand and ten <unk>

SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 313.45 321.86 <NA> i emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation the old dominion eye foundation and asked if they could send it to the right person 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 321.91 324.87 <NA> they said that they had never done this before <unk> and they
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 325.1 329.04 <NA> <unk> 't guarantee a response but they wouldn 't be an obstacle and they would deliver it 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 330.02 336.15 <NA> two days later <unk> i got a response from dr arupa ganguly of the university of pennsylvania <unk>

SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 348.11 354.88 <NA> so next we talked on the phone and one of the first things she said to me was that she couldn 't possibly imagine how we felt
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 354.95 360.61 <NA> and that thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice <unk> and that she seemed to feel indebted to us
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 360.24 369.13 <NA> so i said nothing against your study <unk> but we didn 't actually pick it we donated to the system and the system chose your study <unk> 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 369 373.78 <NA> i said and second of all bad things happen to children every day <unk> 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 373.92 380 <NA> and if you didn 't want these retinas they would probably be buried in the ground right now <unk> so to be able
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 379.96 381.93 <NA> <unk> to participate in your study
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 381.75 384.16 <NA> gives thomas 's life a new

SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 389.35 392.24 <NA> next she explained to me how rare it was 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 392.24 398.9 <NA> she had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier with the national disease research interchange 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 398.65 403.65 <NA> she got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria <unk> and it was thomas 's
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 404.9 413.91 <NA> <unk> next we arranged a date for me to come visit the lab <unk> and we chose march twenty three two thousand and fifteen which was the twins ' fifth birthday <unk> 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 414.08 421.83 <NA> after we hung up i emailed her some pictures of thomas and callum and a few weeks later we received this t shirt in the mail 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 422.63 426.82 <NA> a few months later ross callum and i piled in the car and we went for a road trip

SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 439.55 447.38 <NA> that thomas had a secret code name the same way henrietta lacks is called hela thomas was called
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 454.99 462.53 <NA> <unk> about ten years she also shared with us a unique document <unk> and it was
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 462.04 467.72 <NA> the shipping label that sent his retinas from dc to philadelphia 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 467.8 475.08 <NA> this shipping label is like an heirloom to us now it 's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 477.05 481.93 <NA> <unk> also explained that she is using thomas 's retina and his rna
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 481.93 489.09 <NA> to try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation and she even showed us some results that were based on res three hundred and sixty <unk> 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 489.44 495.43 <NA> then she took us to the freezer and she showed us the two samples that she still has

SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 521.37 529.76 <NA> laughter so in closing i have two simple messages today one is that most of us probably don 't think about donating to research i know i
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 529.98 531.83 <NA> i think i 'm a normal person
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 531.85 537.47 <NA> <unk> but i did it it was a good experience and i recommend it and it brought my family a lot of peace <unk> 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 537.22 547.28 <NA> and second is if you work with human tissue and you wonder about the donor and about the family write them a letter tell them you received it tell them what you 're working on and invite <unk>
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 547.18 552.78 <NA> <unk> them to visit your lab because that visit may be even more gratifying for you than it is for them 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 554.75 559.08 <NA> <unk> successful in arranging one of these visits please tell me about it 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 559.55 569.49 <NA> the other part of my family 's story is that we ended up visiting all four facilities that received thomas 's donations and we met amazing people doing inspiring work 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 569.51 572.71 <NA> the way i see it now is that
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 572.53 574.74 <NA> thomas got into harvard 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 580.62 590.68 <NA> <unk> and he has a job at cytonet and he has colleagues and he has coworkers who are in the top of their fields <unk> and they need him in order to do their job 
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 590.64 595.75 <NA> and a life that once seemed brief and insignificant
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 595.26 597.46 <NA> revealed itself
SarahGray_2015P 1 SarahGray_2015P 597.24 604.61 <NA> to be vital everlasting and relevant <unk> and i only hope that my life can be as relevant
