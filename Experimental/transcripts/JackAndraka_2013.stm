JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 16.33 20.12 <NA> that was so painful and confusing
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 19.75 25.73 <NA> that all you wanted to do was learn as much as you could to make sense of it all
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 25.24 29.97 <NA> when i was thirteen a close family friend who was like an uncle to me
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 30.13 33.06 <NA> passed away from pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 32.87 40.65 <NA> when the disease hit so close to home i knew i needed to learn more so i went online to find answers
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 40.19 47.94 <NA> using the internet i found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer and what i had found shocked me
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 47.9 54.91 <NA> over eighty five percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late when someone has less than a two
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 54.84 56.98 <NA> <unk> percent chance of survival
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 57.24 61.39 <NA> why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 61.38 67.31 <NA> the reason today 's current modern medicine is a sixty year old technique
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 67.31 69.7 <NA> that 's older than my dad laughter
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 73.05 79.97 <NA> but also it 's extremely expensive costing eight hundred dollars per test and
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 80.19 85.28 <NA> it 's grossly inaccurate missing thirty percent of all pancreatic cancers
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 85 91.88 <NA> your doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer in order to give you this test
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 91.48 95.3 <NA> learning this i knew there had to be a better way
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 95.17 104.88 <NA> so i set up a scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer the sensor would have to be
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 104.9 113.82 <NA> <unk> inexpensive rapid simple sensitive selective and minimally invasive
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 113.84 119.25 <NA> now there 's a reason why this test hasn 't been updated in over six decades
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 119.24 124.78 <NA> and that 's because when we 're looking for pancreatic cancer we 're looking at your bloodstream which is already
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 125.28 133.94 <NA> <unk> all these tons and tons of protein and you 're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein just this one protein
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 133.94 136.04 <NA> that 's next to impossible
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 135.82 139.84 <NA> however undeterred due to my teenage optimism applause
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 145.08 150.53 <NA> i went online to a teenager 's two best friends google and wikipedia
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 150.53 153.38 <NA> i got everything for my homework from those two sources
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 155.02 163.91 <NA> <unk> and what i had found was an article that listed a database of over eight thousand different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 163.45 173.03 <NA> so i decided to go and make it my new mission to go through all these proteins and see which ones could serve as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 172.63 178.8 <NA> and to make it a bit simpler for myself i decided to map out a scientific criteria and here
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 180.17 189.48 <NA> <unk> first the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages but also only in cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 189.02 199.32 <NA> and so i 'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task and finally on the four thousand th try when i 'm close to losing my sanity i find the protein
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 198.92 204.97 <NA> and the name of the protein i 'd located was called mesothelin and it 's just your ordinary run of the mill
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 204.93 209.34 <NA> <unk> type protein unless of course you have pancreatic ovarian or lung cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 209.12 212.56 <NA> in which case it 's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 212.56 220.9 <NA> but also the key is that it 's found in the earliest stages of the disease when someone has close to one hundred percent chance of survival
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 220.62 228.77 <NA> so now that i 'd found a reliable protein i could detect i then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein and thus pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 230.02 236.03 <NA> <unk> now my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place possibly the most unlikely place for innovation
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 235.66 240.71 <NA> my high school biology class the absolute stifler of innovation laughter applause
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 245.62 255 <NA> and i had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes and that 's just a long thin pipe of carbon that 's an atom thick and one fifty thousandth the diameter
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 255.08 263.19 <NA> <unk> of your hair and despite their extremely small sizes they have these incredible properties they 're kind of like the superheroes of material science
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 262.73 272.32 <NA> and while i was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class we were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules called antibodies
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 272.32 279.21 <NA> and these are pretty cool because they only react with one specific protein but they 're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 278.9 279.94 <NA> and
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 279.96 284.65 <NA> <unk> so then i was sitting in class and suddenly it hit me
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 284.34 291.68 <NA> i could combine what i was reading about carbon nanotubes with what i was supposed to be thinking about antibodies
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 291.44 300.17 <NA> essentially i could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 300.17 303.76 <NA> but also due to the properties of these nanotubes
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 303.27 305 <NA> it would change its electrical
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 304.99 307.85 <NA> <unk> properties based on the amount of protein present
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 307.69 314 <NA> however there 's a catch these networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 313.54 319.31 <NA> and since they 're so delicate they need to be supported so that 's why i chose to use paper
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 318.97 325.34 <NA> making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies which i love
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 327.4 329.97 <NA> you start with some water pour in some
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 329.9 332.28 <NA> <unk> nanotubes add antibodies
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 332.28 337.83 <NA> mix it up take some paper dip it dry it and you can detect cancer applause
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 345.2 348.73 <NA> then suddenly a thought occurred
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 348.73 352.98 <NA> that kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 352.76 354.97 <NA> i can 't really do cancer research
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 354.93 358.24 <NA> <unk> on my kitchen countertop my mom wouldn 't really like that
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 357.99 361.39 <NA> so instead i decided to go for a lab
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 361.22 375.28 <NA> so i typed up a budget a materials list a timeline and a procedure and i emailed it to two hundred different professors at johns hopkins university and the national institutes of health essentially anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 375.28 379.94 <NA> and i sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in saying you 're a genius you
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 379.96 382.64 <NA> <unk> going to save us all and laughter
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 385.15 394 <NA> then reality took hold and over the course of a month i got one hundred and ninety nine rejections out of those two hundred emails
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 394 399.75 <NA> one professor even went through my entire procedure painstakingly i 'm not really sure where he got all this time
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 399.53 404.91 <NA> and he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake i could ever
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 404.87 411.18 <NA> <unk> make clearly the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as i did
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 411.83 416.89 <NA> however there was a silver lining one professor said maybe i might be able to help you kid
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 416.89 419.34 <NA> so i went in that direction laughter
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 423.26 429.82 <NA> as you can never say no to a kid and so then three months later i finally nailed down
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 429.87 439.57 <NA> <unk> harsh deadline with this guy and i get into his lab i get all excited and then i sit down i start opening my mouth and talking and five seconds later he calls in another ph d
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 439.11 443.16 <NA> ph d s just flock into this little room
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 443.16 454.94 <NA> and they 're just firing these questions at me and by the end i kind of felt like i was in a clown car there were twenty ph d s plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space with them firing these rapid fire questions at
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 454.9 459.8 <NA> <unk> me trying to sink my procedure how unlikely is that i mean pshhh laughter
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 463.96 471.38 <NA> however subjecting myself to that interrogation i answered all of their questions and i guessed on quite a few but i got them right
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 471.16 480 <NA> and i finally landed the lab space i needed but it was shortly afterwards that i discovered my once brilliant procedure had something like
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 479.99 481.71 <NA> <unk> a million holes in it
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 481.31 492.93 <NA> and over the course of seven months i painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes the result one small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 492.5 496.27 <NA> this makes it one hundred and sixty eight times faster
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 496.27 504.55 <NA> over twenty six thousand times less expensive and over four hundred times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 514.68 524.9 <NA> <unk> one of the best parts of the sensor though is that it has close to one hundred percent accuracy and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages when someone has close to one hundred percent chance of survival
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 525.46 538.01 <NA> <unk> and so in the next two to five years this sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal five point five percent to close to one hundred percent and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 537.58 540.05 <NA> but it wouldn 't stop there
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 539.85 548.66 <NA> by switching out that antibody you can look at a different protein thus a different disease potentially any disease in the entire world
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 548.66 554.97 <NA> so that ranges from heart disease to malaria hiv aids as well as other forms of cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 555.01 556.32 <NA> anything
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 555.98 558.31 <NA> and so hopefully one day
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 558.31 566.97 <NA> we can all have that one extra uncle that one mother that one brother sister we can have that one more family member to love
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 566.57 576.54 <NA> and that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden that comes from pancreatic ovarian and lung cancer and potentially any disease
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 576.38 579.97 <NA> that through the internet anything is possible theories
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 579.96 585.25 <NA> <unk> can be shared and you don 't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 584.76 592.78 <NA> it 's a neutral space where what you look like age or gender it doesn 't matter it 's just your ideas that count
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 592.59 602.72 <NA> for me it 's all about looking at the internet in an entirely new way to realize that there 's so much more to it than just posting duck face pictures of yourself online
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 605.2 612.77 <NA> <unk> you could be changing the world so if a fifteen year old who didn 't even know what a pancreas was
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 612.97 616.61 <NA> could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013 1 JackAndraka_2013 616.93 619.92 <NA> just imagine what you could do thank you
