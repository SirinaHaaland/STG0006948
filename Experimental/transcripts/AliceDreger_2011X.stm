AliceDreger_2011X 1 AliceDreger_2011X 487.98 498.91 <NA> now you might think that all this breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy <unk> i 'm a political progressive i defend people with unusual bodies but i have to admit to you that it makes me nervous <unk>

AliceDreger_2011X 1 AliceDreger_2011X 593.04 598.84 <NA> now they were doing it in part because they were part of an enlightenment system where two things were growing up together <unk>

AliceDreger_2011X 1 AliceDreger_2011X 825.31 831.47 <NA> <unk> but at the same time it feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us so where do we go 
AliceDreger_2011X 1 AliceDreger_2011X 831.31 838.74 <NA> it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere 
AliceDreger_2011X 1 AliceDreger_2011X 838.56 849.14 <NA> but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position so for example <unk> texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don 't have a y chromosome <unk>
