JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 430.62 437.6 <NA> and i work on a variety of different resurrection plants <unk> shown here in the hydrated and dry states for a number of reasons 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 437.6 442.93 <NA> one of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that i 'd like to make drought tolerant 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 442.47 448.34 <NA> so on the extreme top left <unk> for example is a grass it 's called eragrostis nindensis it 's
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 448.15 450.16 <NA> got a close relative called <unk>
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 452.74 458.09 <NA> <unk> it 's a staple food in ethiopia it 's gluten free and it 's something we would like to make drought tolerant 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 458.32 464.48 <NA> the other reason for looking at a number of plants is that at least initially i wanted to find out do they do the same thing 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 464.48 468.53 <NA> do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 468.79 476 <NA> so i undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 475.78 478.77 <NA> in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 480.05 485.34 <NA> for example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 484.97 492.57 <NA> we look at the transcriptome which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off in response to drying <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 492.29 498.9 <NA> most genes will code for proteins <unk> so we look at the proteome <unk> what are the proteins made in response to drying 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 498.98 504.31 <NA> some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites <unk> so we look at the
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 504.96 506.21 <NA> <unk> now this is important
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 505.97 512.21 <NA> because plants are stuck in the ground they use what i call a highly tuned chemical arsenal
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 512.21 518.96 <NA> to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment <unk> so it 's important that we look at the chemical changes
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 518.77 525.02 <NA> involved in drying <unk> and at the last study that we do at the molecular level we look at the <unk> lipidome the lipid changes

JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 526.06 535.76 <NA> and that 's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids they 're held as membranes because they 're in water <unk> take away the water those membranes fall apart 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 535.78 544.73 <NA> lipids also act as signals to turn on genes then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the <unk>
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 545.88 553.26 <NA> that we 've actually discovered in our other studies <unk> and then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 555.52 561.9 <NA> i 've always had the philosophy that i needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance

JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 566.57 573.24 <NA> i 'm sure some of you are thinking by biotic application does she mean she 's going to make genetically modified crops and
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 573.8 574.99 <NA> the answer to that
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 575 578.5 <NA> question is depends on your definition of genetic modification 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 578.73 581.84 <NA> all of the crops that we eat today wheat rice and maize 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 581.84 589.96 <NA> are highly genetically modified from their ancestors <unk> but we don 't consider them gm because they 're being produced by conventional breeding <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 590.4 600.17 <NA> if you mean am i going to put resurrection plant genes into crops <unk> your answer is yes in the essence of time we have tried that approach more appropriately
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 603.94 607.58 <NA> <unk> have spearheaded that approach and i 'm going to show you some data soon <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 608.71 619.4 <NA> but we 're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop they 're
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 618.94 622.58 <NA> just never turned on under extreme drought conditions <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 622.36 626.48 <NA> i leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called gm or not 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 627.1 629.85 <NA> i 'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 629.78 634.89 <NA> <unk> approach and in order to do that i have to explain a little bit about how genes work 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 634.52 643.89 <NA> so you probably all know that genes are made of double stranded dna it 's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant 's body
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 643.58 649.99 <NA> if you unwind that dna <unk> you get genes <unk> and each gene has a promoter <unk>
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 652.68 659.2 <NA> <unk> the gene coding region <unk> and then a terminator which indicates that this is the end of this gene <unk> the next gene will start 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 659.25 664.4 <NA> now promoters are not simple on off switches they normally require a lot of
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 665.58 675.05 <NA> <unk> of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on <unk> so what 's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 675.01 681.65 <NA> <unk> we know how to switch it on we couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 681.67 689.41 <NA> in the study that i 'm going to talk to you about my collaborators used a drought induced promoter which we discovered in a resurrection plant
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 689.41 695.33 <NA> the nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing the plant itself senses drought 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 695.14 700.23 <NA> and we 've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 702.83 705.49 <NA> <unk> all stresses particularly drought stress 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 705.49 713.52 <NA> results in the formation of free radicals or reactive oxygen species which are highly damaging and can cause crop death <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 713.18 716.7 <NA> what antioxidants do is stop that damage <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 716.87 727.8 <NA> so here 's some data from a maize strain that 's very popularly used in africa to the left of the arrow are plants without the genes to the right plants with the antioxidant genes 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 727.8 729.91 <NA> after three weeks without watering the
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 729.87 732.25 <NA> <unk> ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 733.29 738.41 <NA> now to the final approach <unk> my research has shown that there 's considerable similarity
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 738.17 746.38 <NA> in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants <unk> so i ask the question are they using the same genes 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 745.98 754.43 <NA> or slightly differently phrased are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves have they
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 755.04 756.45 <NA> <unk> retasked these seed genes
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 756.27 758.84 <NA> in roots and leaves of resurrection plants 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 759.28 761.48 <NA> and i answer that question 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 761.14 770.37 <NA> as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of henk hilhorst in the netherlands <unk> mel oliver in the united states and julia buitink
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 770.37 771.83 <NA> in france the
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 771.4 779.91 <NA> answer is yes that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both and i 'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize <unk> where the
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 779.87 785.61 <NA> <unk> chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 785.18 791.67 <NA> so as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development they switch these genes on 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 792.23 796.83 <NA> resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 796.76 804.88 <NA> all modern crops therefore have these genes in their roots and leaves they just never switch them on they only switch them on in seed tissues
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 804.96 812.59 <NA> so what we 're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants <unk> 
JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 812.82 815.44 <NA> to mimic the process in crops

JillFarrant_2015G 1 JillFarrant_2015G 816.93 825.7 <NA> what we 're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some ten to forty million years ago
