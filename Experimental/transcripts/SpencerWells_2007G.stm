SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 159.88 167.27 <NA> and as these two species are now man 's nearest allies it 's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere 
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 166.99 175.35 <NA> so we 're done we can go home finished the origin question well not quite because darwin was talking about our distant ancestry
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 175.31 184.14 <NA> <unk> our common ancestry with apes <unk> and it is quite clear that apes originated on the african continent around twenty three million years ago they appear in the fossil record

SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1062.15 1069.82 <NA> in the study of human origins where we all came from using the tools of dna to map the migrations around the world you know
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1069.33 1075.4 <NA> the study of human origins is kind of in our dna and we want to take it to the next level what do you want to do next 
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1074.97 1077.72 <NA> which is a great question to be asked by national geographic
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1079.75 1089.06 <NA> <unk> well <unk> you know <unk> what i 've sketched out here is just that <unk> it is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet <unk> and it 's based on a few thousand people we 've sampled from you know 
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1088.69 1093 <NA> a handful of populations around the world studied a a few genetic markers 
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1093 1104.4 <NA> and there are lots of gaps on this map we 've just connected the dots what we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more hundreds of thousands of dna samples from people all over the world

SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1130.71 1140.59 <NA> where am i indigenous to nowhere really my genes are all jumbled up but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the dna results <unk>
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1140.54 1146.71 <NA> that 's the focus of the field research the centers that we 've set up all over the world ten of them top population geneticists

SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1161.05 1164.96 <NA> <unk> genographic you can order a kit you can test your own dna <unk> 
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1164.96 1173.87 <NA> and you can actually submit those results to the database and tell us a little about your genealogical background have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort

SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1176.63 1185.26 <NA> <unk> and so the money that we raise after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components gets plowed back into the project the majority going to something we call the legacy fund it
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1185.26 1199.96 <NA> 's a charitable entity basically a grant giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational cultural projects initiated by them they apply to this fund in order to do various projects and i 'll show you a couple of examples <unk> so how are we doing on the
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1200.28 1204.16 <NA> <unk> we 've got about twenty five thousand samples collected from indigenous people around the world <unk> 
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1203.93 1214.39 <NA> the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public two hundred and ten thousand people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago <unk> which has raised around five million dollars <unk>
SpencerWells_2007G 1 SpencerWells_2007G 1214.34 1222.32 <NA> <unk> the majority of which at least half is going back into the legacy fund <unk> we 've just awarded the first legacy grants totaling around five hundred thousand dollars
