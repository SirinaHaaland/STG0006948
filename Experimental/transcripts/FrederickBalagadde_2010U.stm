FrederickBalagadde_2010U 1 FrederickBalagadde_2010U 179.9 189.78 <NA> <unk> develop some devices this is a microfluidic chip that i developed a close look at how the technology works these are channels that are about the size of a human hair
FrederickBalagadde_2010U 1 FrederickBalagadde_2010U 189.58 199.11 <NA> so you have integrated valves pumps mixers and injectors so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a a microfluidic system <unk> 
FrederickBalagadde_2010U 1 FrederickBalagadde_2010U 199.16 204.94 <NA> so what i plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology
