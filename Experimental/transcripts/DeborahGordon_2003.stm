DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 537.55 539.79 <NA> are doing nothing and they sort of

DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 575.91 578.34 <NA> <unk> so just to reinforce
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 578.15 581.99 <NA> that what you might have thought about ant queens isn 't true
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 581.81 591.64 <NA> you know even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 591.18 599.98 <NA> there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 599.97 604.13 <NA> so that 's one way that we know the queen isn 't directing the behavior of the colony
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 604.99 609.69 <NA> <unk> so when i first set out to work on task allocation my first question was 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 609.69 620.12 <NA> what 's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 619.9 622.19 <NA> and i was working
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 621.76 629.97 <NA> in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 630.04 638.4 <NA> independently of the others knowing its place on the assembly line and instead i wanted to ask how are the different task groups interdependent 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 637.94 651.43 <NA> so i did experiments where i changed one thing so for example <unk> i created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 651.43 653.5 <NA> this is what it looks like about twenty minutes later
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 654.87 661.52 <NA> <unk> about forty minutes later and the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 661.52 672.58 <NA> and what i wanted to know was ok here 's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks then we
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 672.15 679.94 <NA> repeated all those experiments with the ants marked so here 's some blue nest maintenance workers <unk> and lately we 've gotten more sophisticated
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 679.96 690.03 <NA> <unk> we have this three color system and we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which we started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers and
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 689.98 699.66 <NA> <unk> they work really well <unk> and so just to summarize the result well it turns out that yes the different tasks are interdependent so if i change the numbers performing one task 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 705.04 711.03 <NA> then i see fewer ants out foraging and this was true for all the pair wise combinations of tasks <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 710.6 722.79 <NA> and the second result <unk> which was surprising to a lot of people was that ants actually switch tasks the same ant doesn 't do the same task over and over its whole life <unk> so for example if i put out extra food
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 722.39 729.97 <NA> <unk> everybody else the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food they become foragers the nest maintenance workers become foragers the patrollers
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 730.05 731.29 <NA> <unk> become foragers 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 731.29 743.27 <NA> but not every transition is possible <unk> and this shows how it works like i just said if there is more food to collect the patrollers the midden workers the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 743.09 749.96 <NA> if there 's more patrolling to do so i created a disturbance <unk> so extra patrollers were needed the nest maintenance workers will switch to
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 750.94 755.25 <NA> <unk> but if more nest maintenance work is needed for example if i put out a bunch of toothpicks
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 755.25 763.88 <NA> then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance <unk> they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest <unk> so foraging acts as
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 763.51 768.17 <NA> a sink <unk> and the ants inside the nest act as a source <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 767.74 779.91 <NA> and finally it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not so for example when there 's extra nest maintenance work to do it 's not that the foragers switch over i know
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 780.02 785.31 <NA> <unk> they don 't do that but the foragers somehow decide not to come out and here was the most
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 785.14 795.84 <NA> intriguing result the task allocation this process changes with colony age and it changes like this when i do these experiments with older colonies so ones that are five years or older <unk>
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 795.79 804.97 <NA> they 're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic the worse things get the more i hassle them <unk> the more they act like undisturbed colonies whereas the young
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 805.08 810.97 <NA> <unk> small colonies the two year old colonies of just two thousand ants are much more variable <unk> and the
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 811.02 815.08 <NA> amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year it
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 815.08 829.64 <NA> could be this year or this year <unk> so the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony it 's not due to the experience of older wiser ants <unk> instead something about the organization must be
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 829.6 839.27 <NA> <unk> changing as the colony gets older and the obvious thing that 's changing is its size so since i 've had this result <unk> i 've spent a lot of time

DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 861.14 865.71 <NA> and what i 've found out is that ants are using
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 865.25 875.05 <NA> a network of antennal contact so anybody who 's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae <unk> they smell with their antennae <unk> when one ant touches another it 's smelling

DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 886.38 896.5 <NA> and what we 're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks <unk> in deciding what to do <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 896.5 899.96 <NA> and so what the message is is not any
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 900 907.71 <NA> <unk> message that they transmit from one ant to another <unk> but the pattern the pattern itself is the message and i 'll tell you a little bit more about that

DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 927.22 937.68 <NA> and we 've learned that in this species and i suspect in others as well these hydrocarbons this layer of grease on the outside of ants is different <unk>
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 937.58 947.17 <NA> <unk> as ants perform different tasks <unk> and we 've done experiments that show that that 's because the longer an ant stays outside the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface

DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1004.99 1018.47 <NA> <unk> the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines or influences each ant 's decision about whether to go out and which task to perform this is taken through a fiber optics microscope it 's down inside the nest
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1018.1 1025.4 <NA> in the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope <unk> but the idea is that the ants are in there 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1026.05 1029.97 <NA> and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1029.96 1041.76 <NA> <unk> past it a stream of contacts with other ants <unk> and the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out and what it does when it comes back out
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1041.93 1049.99 <NA> you can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these each
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1050.82 1061 <NA> <unk> as it comes back in is contacting other ants <unk> and the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip are contacting the ants coming in 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1060.72 1066.79 <NA> so what 's interesting about this system is that it 's messy <unk> it 's variable it 's noisy 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1066.79 1079.97 <NA> and in particular <unk> in two ways <unk> the first is that the experience of the ant of each ant can 't be very predictable because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1079.9 1083.36 <NA> <unk> to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1083.38 1093.95 <NA> and the second thing is that an ant 's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1094.09 1102.96 <NA> so we do a lot of simulation and modeling and also experimental work to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1102.79 1104.94 <NA> combine to in the
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1104.87 1114.49 <NA> <unk> aggregate produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies <unk> again i don 't want to say that this kind of haphazard
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1114.49 1117.93 <NA> pattern of interactions produces
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1118.22 1129.97 <NA> a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork in fact if you watch ants at all you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1130.1 1132.59 <NA> it so it 's not really that
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1134.15 1136.42 <NA> out of these haphazard contacts
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1136.23 1146.35 <NA> <unk> perfection arises <unk> but it works pretty well ants have been around for several hundred million years <unk> they cover the earth except for antarctica <unk> 
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1145.89 1149.78 <NA> something that they 're doing is clearly successful enough
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1149.59 1154.91 <NA> that this pattern of haphazard contacts in the aggregate <unk> produces something that allows
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1154.84 1164.09 <NA> <unk> ants to make a lot more ants and one of the things that we 're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1163.93 1170.39 <NA> use of interaction patterns this network of interaction patterns to
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1170.29 1175.02 <NA> perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies so the one
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1175.34 1188.67 <NA> <unk> that i want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you 'd expect to be closely connected to colony size <unk> the simplest idea is that when an ant
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1188.54 1198.72 <NA> is in a small colony and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule like i expect to meet another forager every three seconds but in a small <unk>
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1198.62 1204.94 <NA> <unk> colony <unk> it 's likely to meet fewer foragers just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1205.01 1214.28 <NA> so this is the kind of rule that as the colony develops and gets older and larger will produce different behavior in an old colony
DeborahGordon_2003 1 DeborahGordon_2003 1214.28 1215.69 <NA> and a small young one
