DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 15.76 25.46 <NA> and a few years after i left i went back and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me said dan <unk> i have a fantastic new treatment for you i was
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 24.97 29.7 <NA> very excited i walked with him to his office <unk> and he explained to me that when i shave
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 29.99 38.97 <NA> <unk> i have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is but on the right side of my face i was badly burned so i have no hair and this creates lack of symmetry 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 38.69 45.24 <NA> and what 's the brilliant idea he had <unk> he was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 44.9 54.94 <NA> of my face and make me look very symmetric it sounded interesting he asked me to go and shave <unk> let me tell you this was a strange way to shave because i thought about it and
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 54.87 60.49 <NA> <unk> i realized that the way i was shaving then would be the way i would shave for the rest of my life because i had to keep the
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 60.09 63.74 <NA> the width the same when i got back to his office
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 63.53 72.73 <NA> i wasn 't really sure <unk> i said can i see some evidence for this so he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots not very informative i
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 72.66 77.18 <NA> said what happens when i grow older and my hair becomes white what would happen then
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 79.81 81.23 <NA> <unk> whiten it out 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 82.39 87.47 <NA> but i was still concerned so i said you know what i 'm not going to do it 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 87.13 94.19 <NA> and then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life this is coming from a jewish guy all right so that means a lot 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 95.23 100.02 <NA> laughter and he said dan what 's wrong with you do you enjoy
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 101.3 103.23 <NA> <unk> you have some kind of perverted
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 103.25 105.42 <NA> pleasure from this 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 106.16 112.95 <NA> do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently none of those happened
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 115.13 122.67 <NA> and this was very surprising to me because i 've gone through many treatments there were many treatments i decided not to do and i never got this this guilt trip to this extent <unk> 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 122.67 125.05 <NA> but i decided not to have this treatment and i went
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 125.01 133.72 <NA> <unk> to his deputy and asked him what was going on <unk> where was this guilt trip coming from and he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already <unk> 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 133.23 136.78 <NA> and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing now you
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 138.69 145.39 <NA> probably think that this guy 's a schmuck right that 's what he seems like <unk> but let me give you a different perspective on the same story 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 145.11 150.05 <NA> a few years ago i was running some of my own experiments in the lab <unk> and when we run
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 150.46 155.43 <NA> <unk> we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another <unk> so we had one group that i hoped their
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 155.43 163.17 <NA> performance would be very high another group that i thought their performance would be very low <unk> and when i got the results that 's what we got i was very happy
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 162.72 175.46 <NA> aside from one person there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly and he pulled the whole mean down <unk> destroying my statistical significance of the test 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 175.93 178.77 <NA> so i looked carefully at this guy he was
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 179.81 183 <NA> <unk> anybody else in the sample <unk> and i remembered that the <unk>
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 184.25 187.83 <NA> <unk> drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 187.66 193.89 <NA> and this was the guy fantastic i thought let 's throw him out who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 194.66 203.61 <NA> but a couple of days later we thought about it with my students and we said what would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition what would have happened if he was in the other group 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 203.51 204.94 <NA> would we have thrown him
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 204.93 218.02 <NA> <unk> out then we probably wouldn 't have looked at the data at all and if we did look at the data we 'd probably have said fantastic what a smart guy who is performing this low because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower giving us even stronger statistical results than we could <unk> 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 217.68 224.9 <NA> so we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment <unk> but you know these stories and lots of other experiments that we 've done
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 225.16 231.62 <NA> <unk> on conflicts of interest <unk> basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 231.34 241.94 <NA> the first one is that in life we encounter many people who in some way or another try to tattoo our faces they just have the incentives that get them to be blinded <unk>
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 241.84 252.38 <NA> <unk> to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased <unk> and i 'm sure that it 's something that we all recognize and we see that it happens maybe we don 't recognize it every time but we understand that it happens 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 255.23 265.3 <NA> <unk> that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives and that 's a much much more difficult lesson to take into account because we don 't see how conflicts of interest
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 265.25 277.98 <NA> <unk> work on us when i was doing these experiments in my mind i was helping science i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through i wasn 't doing something bad in my mind i was actually
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 279.81 285.22 <NA> <unk> along <unk> but this was not the case i was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 284.76 291.07 <NA> and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 291.07 301.84 <NA> and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances <unk> 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 301.98 304.7 <NA> i do want to leave you with one positive thought
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 304.93 309.24 <NA> <unk> all very depressing right people have conflicts of interest we don 't see it and so on 
DanAriely_2011U 1 DanAriely_2011U 309.06 321.9 <NA> the positive perspective i think of all of this is that if we do understand when we go wrong if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail we can actually hope to fix things and that i think is the hope
