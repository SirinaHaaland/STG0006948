LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 954.92 957.13 <NA> it will be everywhere in the world
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 957.33 961.99 <NA> now if we had an undo button <unk> and we could go back
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 961.77 972.34 <NA> and isolate it and grab it when it first started if we could find it early and we had early detection and early response <unk> and we could put each one of those viruses in jail
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 972.27 974.96 <NA> that 's the only way to deal
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 975.13 985.07 <NA> <unk> with something like a pandemic and let me show you why that is we have a joke this is an epidemic curve and
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 984.73 988.45 <NA> everyone in medicine i think ultimately gets to know what it is 
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 988.46 995.3 <NA> but the joke is an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve 
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 995.71 1004.67 <NA> but you don 't get to do that usually you usually arrive right about here what we really want is to arrive right here <unk> so we can stop
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1004.87 1011.57 <NA> <unk> the epidemic <unk> but you can 't always do that but there 's an organization that has been able to find a way
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1011.34 1019.25 <NA> to learn when the first cases occur and that is called gphin it 's the global public health information network <unk> 
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1018.79 1024.84 <NA> and that simulation that i showed you that you thought was bird flu that was sars and sars is the
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1039.17 1043.11 <NA> <unk> announced it and because of that we were able to stop
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1043.11 1049.93 <NA> the sars pandemic and i think we owe a great debt of gratitude to gphin and to ron st john who i hope is in the audience some
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1065.55 1073.72 <NA> <unk> and ted has flown ron here from ottawa where gphin is located <unk> because not only did gphin find
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1073.32 1078.82 <NA> sars early but you may have seen last week that iran announced
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1078.48 1079.97 <NA> that they had bird
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1079.96 1094.28 <NA> <unk> flu in iran <unk> but gphin found the bird flu in iran not february fourteen but last september we need an early warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity 's worst nightmare 
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1094.15 1099.78 <NA> and so my ted wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1106.19 1116.31 <NA> <unk> pandemic bird flu early detection early response <unk> it is a litany it is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1116.24 1124.84 <NA> is to find them early and to kill them before they spread so my ted wish is for you to help build a global
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1127.29 1134.71 <NA> <unk> to protect us against humanity 's worst nightmares <unk> and what i thought i would call it
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1134.91 1140.51 <NA> is early detection but it should really be called
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1158.2 1159.95 <NA> <unk> in all seriousness <unk> 
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1159.67 1163.55 <NA> because this idea is birthed in ted 
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1163.15 1167.27 <NA> i would like it to be a legacy of ted <unk> 
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1166.78 1174.12 <NA> and i 'd like to call it the international system for total early disease detection
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1180.2 1182.76 <NA> <unk> then becomes our mantra <unk> 
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1184.73 1193.62 <NA> so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu we find it and immediately contain it instead of a novel virus caused by by <unk>
LarryBrilliant_2006 1 LarryBrilliant_2006 1195.49 1204.55 <NA> or shift or drift <unk> we find it and we contain it instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in bhopal
