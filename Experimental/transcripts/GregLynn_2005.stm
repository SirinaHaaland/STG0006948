GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 12.49 23.93 <NA> <unk> i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that 's tracked by architecture what 's interesting about architects is 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 23.92 29.76 <NA> we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature and
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 29.75 39.6 <NA> <unk> arguably <unk> beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature <unk> so <unk> for roughly three hundred years the hot debate in architecture
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 39.14 48.96 <NA> was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture because the nose was one fifth of your head 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 48.96 50.14 <NA> or because your head
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 50.97 52.15 <NA> <unk> of your body 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 51.66 62.09 <NA> and the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet it wasn 't the <unk> 16th century
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 61.64 62.7 <NA> and
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 62.71 74.93 <NA> everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions <unk> so a room would be dimensioned as one fourth of a facade the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as ten
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 76.05 86.18 <NA> get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision finer and finer and finer in the <unk> <unk> 15th century the decimal point was invented architects <unk>
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 86.08 91.23 <NA> <unk> stopped using fractions and they had a new model of nature <unk> so <unk> what 's going on
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 96.87 104.97 <NA> and which is using digital tools <unk> and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form and it has a lot of implications
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 105.05 106.78 <NA> <unk> in the way we think about nature <unk> 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 106.57 117 <NA> the best example of this would probably be the gothic and the gothic was invented after the invention of calculus although the gothic architects weren 't really using <unk>
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 116.9 126.88 <NA> <unk> calculus to define their forms <unk> but what was important is the gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form <unk> 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 129.69 139.99 <NA> <unk> cross you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines so you 're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form <unk>
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 139.94 149.14 <NA> <unk> much later robert maillart 's bridges which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola <unk> 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 155.02 164.77 <NA> <unk> the end of the <unk> 19th century beginning of the 20th century and how that hanging chain model translates into archways

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 165.94 175.68 <NA> so in all of these examples structure is the determining force frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 175.52 179.97 <NA> and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 180.29 192.93 <NA> interestingly in the last ten years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery with the structural engineer chris williams 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 192.93 204.97 <NA> in all these examples there 's one ideal form <unk> because these are thought in terms of structure <unk> and as an architect i 've always found these kinds of systems very limiting because
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 204.96 213.55 <NA> <unk> i 'm not interested in ideal forms and i 'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment so what i thought i would
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 213.57 222.49 <NA> bring up is another component that needs to be thought of whenever you think about nature <unk> and that 's basically the invention of

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 226.63 233.42 <NA> <unk> my hero is actually not darwin it 's a guy named william bateson father of greg bateson who was here for a long time
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 233.2 243.32 <NA> in monterey <unk> and he was what you 'd call a teratologist he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules <unk>
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 243.22 248.34 <NA> <unk> and laws rather than looking at the norms so instead of trying to find the ideal type

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 260.44 267.16 <NA> ten years ago i actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time <unk> beautiful because it has symmetry <unk> 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 266.95 273.07 <NA> so <unk> what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations <unk> instead of
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 272.89 279.94 <NA> having a thumb <unk> you would either get another opposable thumb <unk> or you would get four fingers so the mutations reverted

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 280.85 285.58 <NA> and bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 285.38 289.86 <NA> which is that wherever you lose information in a system <unk> 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 289.87 299.21 <NA> you revert back to symmetry so symmetry wasn 't the sign of order and organization which is what i was always understanding and as is an architect
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 299.03 304.76 <NA> symmetry was the absence of information <unk> so whenever you lost information you 'd move to symmetry
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 305.05 311.03 <NA> <unk> you added information to a system you would break symmetry so this whole idea of natural form
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 311.03 319.94 <NA> shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 319.78 321.62 <NA> and generic form <unk> 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 321.62 329.94 <NA> you know <unk> literally after seeing that image and finding out what bateson was working with we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 333.5 341.64 <NA> to just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we 're using now and how they integrate calculus <unk> the fact that <unk>
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 342.94 349.75 <NA> means that we don 't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 352.14 356.95 <NA> <unk> in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components so there might be

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 362.3 369.41 <NA> that all need to get organized now typically you 'd think that they would all be the same like the chairs you 're sitting in would all be the same dimension you know
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 369.41 375.32 <NA> i haven 't verified this but it 's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 375.1 378.86 <NA> because you 'd want to space them all out for everybody 's sight lines

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 426.42 435.02 <NA> <unk> with calculus the whole idea of subdivision is more complex because the whole and the parts are one continuous series it 's
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 435.02 441.91 <NA> too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus so i brought some images to just describe how that works this
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 441.66 449.81 <NA> is a korean church that we did in queens <unk> and in this example you can see that the components of this

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 705.04 712.92 <NA> doesn 't want their car to look too much like the <unk> bottom of the market car so they have to also discriminate between these products <unk> so <unk>

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 830.02 840 <NA> <unk> is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm like we have to design things which are coherent as a single object

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 977.44 979.91 <NA> and i think this just shows how
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 979.72 992.24 <NA> <unk> how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large scale construction we wanted to make a kind of gothic cathedral around the footprints of the world trade center site 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 991.78 995.46 <NA> and to do that we tried to connect up

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 1002.74 1006.89 <NA> <unk> there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 1006.43 1020 <NA> we really approached it at the level of the typology of the building <unk> where we could build these five separate towers but they would all join at the <unk> 60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass <unk> 
GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 1019.57 1026.6 <NA> with united architects also we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system <unk>

GregLynn_2005 1 GregLynn_2005 1030.98 1043.24 <NA> but again you can see this kind of organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole but breaks down into smaller parts but in an incredibly organic way
