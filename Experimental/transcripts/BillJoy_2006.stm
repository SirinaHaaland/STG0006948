BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 938.42 945.79 <NA> that will address this so if we can address use technology help address education help address the environment help address the pandemic <unk> 
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 945.79 948.51 <NA> does that solve the larger problem
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 948.29 952.23 <NA> that i was talking about in the wired article and i 'm afraid
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 952.19 954.97 <NA> the answer is really no because
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 955.31 960.37 <NA> you can 't solve a problem with the management of technology with more
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 959.97 961.84 <NA> technology 
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 961.35 964.63 <NA> if we let an unlimited amount of power loose 
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 964.63 972.64 <NA> then we will a very small number of people will be able to abuse it we can 't fight at a <unk> million to one disadvantage 
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 972.21 974.66 <NA> so what we need to do is we need better
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 975.82 985.86 <NA> <unk> and for example some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 985.62 988.88 <NA> use markets markets are a very strong force 
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 988.88 997.94 <NA> for example rather than trying to regulate away problems which probably won 't work if we could price into the cost of doing business the cost of catastrophe 
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 997.9 1004.79 <NA> so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 1004.83 1010.79 <NA> so if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on but it wouldn 't have to be approved by regulators you 'd have to convince an actuary
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 1010.56 1015.47 <NA> that it would be safe <unk> and if you apply the notion of insurance more more
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 1015.47 1024.66 <NA> broadly you can use a more powerful force a market force to provide feedback how could you keep the law i think the law would be a really good thing to keep well you have to hold people
BillJoy_2006 1 BillJoy_2006 1031.82 1041.16 <NA> <unk> have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions so if you tie that you have to tie that back with the law <unk> and finally i think we have to do something that 's
