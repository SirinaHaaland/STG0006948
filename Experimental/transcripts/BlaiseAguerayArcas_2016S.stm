BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 512.04 523.93 <NA> what you 're looking at is a phone looking at one after another picture of a bird and actually not only saying yes it 's a bird but identifying the species of bird with a network of this sort

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 529.78 535.49 <NA> <unk> unknown i 'm glossing over the very difficult part of course which is how on earth do we figure out

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 540.85 549.96 <NA> so this process of learning <unk> of solving for w <unk> if we were doing this with the with the simple equation in which we think about these as numbers we know exactly how to

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 554.03 562.94 <NA> and we 're done the problem is with this operator so division we 've used division because it 's the inverse to multiplication but
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 562.95 567.19 <NA> as i as i 've just said <unk> the multiplication is a bit of a lie here
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 567.01 575.26 <NA> this is a very very complicated very non linear operation it has no inverse so we have to figure out a way to solve the equation
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 575.02 579.88 <NA> without a division operator <unk> and the way to do that is fairly straightforward you just say
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 580.01 587.39 <NA> <unk> <unk> let 's play a little algebra trick and move the six over to the right hand side of the equation now we 're still using multiplication <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 587.15 595.27 <NA> and that zero let 's think about it as an error <unk> in other words if we 've solved for w the right way <unk> then the error will be zero <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 595.27 598.97 <NA> and if we haven 't gotten it quite right the error will be greater than zero <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 598.74 604.52 <NA> so now we can just take guesses to minimize the error <unk> and that 's the sort of thing computers are very good at
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 605.07 612.84 <NA> you 've taken an initial guess what if w = zero well then the error is six what if w = one the error is four and then the computer can sort of play marco polo <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 612.6 618.75 <NA> and drive down the error close to zero <unk> as it does that it 's getting successive approximations to w
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 618.75 627.71 <NA> typically it never quite gets there but after about a dozen steps we 're up to w <unk> = two point nine nine nine which is close enough 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 627.76 629.94 <NA> and this is the learning process
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 630.43 640.83 <NA> remember that what 's what 's been going on here is that we 've been taking a lot of known x 's and known y 's and solving for the w in the middle through an iterative process <unk>
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 640.78 649.39 <NA> it 's exactly the same way that we do our own learning <unk> we have many many images as babies and we get told this is a bird <unk> this is not a bird 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 655.35 656.4 <NA> <unk> so
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 656.16 668.27 <NA> now we 've held x and w fixed to solve for y that 's everyday fast perception we figure out how we can solve for w that 's learning which is a lot harder because we need to do error minimization using a lot of training examples 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 668.27 674.78 <NA> and about a year ago alex mordvintsev on our team decided to experiment with what happens if we try solving for

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 686.47 695.24 <NA> it turns out that by using exactly the same error minimization procedure one can do that with the network trained to recognize birds <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 695.24 697.61 <NA> and the result
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 697.18 699.23 <NA> turns out to be

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 715.4 721.92 <NA> here 's another fun example this was a work made by mike tyka in our group which

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 729.84 740.23 <NA> <unk> creates a movie this way in this case what mike is doing is varying y over the space of different animals in a network designed to recognize and distinguish different animals from each other and you get this

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 758.58 768 <NA> doing this kind of synthesis or generation of imagery over that entire surface varying y over the surface you make a kind of map a visual map of all the things the network

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 792.29 799.14 <NA> psychedelic picture of me from multiple points of view at once the reason it looks like multiple points of view at once is because
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 798.92 804.91 <NA> that network is designed to get rid of the ambiguity of a face being in one pose or another pose
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 804.87 817.66 <NA> <unk> being looked at with one kind of lighting another kind of lighting so when you do this sort of reconstruction if you don 't use some sort of guide image or guide statistics then you 'll get a sort of confusion of different points of view 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 817.17 819.28 <NA> because it 's ambiguous <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 819.21 827.68 <NA> this is what happens if alex uses his own face as a guide image during that optimization process to reconstruct my own face <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 827.76 829.55 <NA> so you can see it 's not
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 830.07 834.8 <NA> perfect there 's still quite a lot of work to do on how we optimize that optimization process <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 834.8 839.99 <NA> but you start to get something more like a coherent face rendered using my own face as a guide 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 840.31 842.4 <NA> you don 't have to start with
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 842.19 849.96 <NA> a blank canvas or with white noise when you 're solving for x you can begin with an x that is itself already some other image <unk>
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 850.43 853.8 <NA> <unk> that 's what this little demonstration is this is a network
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 853.46 854.6 <NA> that
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 854.38 862.05 <NA> that is designed to categorize all sorts of different objects man made structures animals here we 're starting with just a picture of clouds <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 862.05 868.83 <NA> and as we optimize basically this network is figuring out what it sees in the clouds <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 868.37 874.23 <NA> and the more time you spend looking at this the more things you also will see in the clouds <unk> 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 874.43 879.79 <NA> you could also use the face network to hallucinate into this and you get some pretty crazy stuff
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 881.85 887.47 <NA> or mike has done some other experiments in which he takes
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 887.31 894.99 <NA> that cloud image hallucinates zooms hallucinates zooms hallucinates zooms and in this way <unk> you can get a sort of
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 894.99 898.93 <NA> fugue state of the network i suppose or a sort of
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 899.02 900.02 <NA> free
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 901.12 910.91 <NA> <unk> in which the network is eating its own tail so every every image is now the basis for what do i think i see next what do i think i see next what do i think i see next 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 910.87 913.49 <NA> i showed this for the first time
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 913.12 915.26 <NA> in public to
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 915.19 917 <NA> to a group
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 916.75 923.03 <NA> at a lecture in seattle called higher education this was right after marijuana was legalized 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 927.35 932.58 <NA> <unk> like to finish up quickly by just noting that this technology is not
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 932.09 939 <NA> constrained i 've shown you purely visual examples because they 're really fun to look at it 's not a purely visual technology 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 938.69 950.11 <NA> our artist collaborator ross goodwin has done experiments involving a camera that takes a picture <unk> and then a computer in his backpack writes a poem using neural networks based on the contents
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 950.1 954.13 <NA> <unk> of the image <unk> and that poetry neural network has been trained on
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 953.9 963.22 <NA> a large corpus of 20th century poetry and the poetry is you know i think kind of not bad actually in closing <unk> i think that
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 963.02 969.73 <NA> per michelangelo i think he was right perception and creativity are very intimately connected 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 969.27 976.87 <NA> what we 've just seen are neural networks that are entirely trained to discriminate or to recognize different things in the world 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 976.5 979.04 <NA> able to be run in reverse to generate
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 979.93 987.56 <NA> <unk> one of the things that suggests to me is not only that michelangelo really did see the sculpture in the blocks of stone but that
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 987.33 998.63 <NA> any any creature any being any alien that is able to do perceptual acts of that sort is also able to create because it 's exactly the same machinery that 's used in both cases 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 998.17 1000.91 <NA> also i think that
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1000.45 1004.97 <NA> perception and creativity are by no means uniquely human <unk> we start to
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1004.9 1011.09 <NA> <unk> have computer models that can do exactly these sorts of things and that ought to be unsurprising the brain is computational 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1011.08 1013.05 <NA> and finally 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1012.87 1023.34 <NA> computing began as an exercise in designing intelligent machinery <unk> it was very much modeled after the idea of how could we make machines intelligent 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1023.34 1025.14 <NA> and we finally are starting to fulfill
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1025.88 1033.09 <NA> <unk> some of the promises of those early pioneers of turing and von neumann and mcculloch and pitts <unk> and
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1032.84 1040.72 <NA> i think that computing is not just about accounting or playing candy crush or something from the beginning we modeled them after our minds 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1 BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S 1040.72 1045.93 <NA> and they give us both the ability to understand our own minds better and to extend them <unk>
