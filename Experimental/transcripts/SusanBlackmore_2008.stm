SusanBlackmore_2008 1 SusanBlackmore_2008 1007.42 1015.11 <NA> well we did pull through <unk> and we adapted <unk> but now we 're hitting as i 've just described we 're hitting the third replicator point 
SusanBlackmore_2008 1 SusanBlackmore_2008 1015.64 1025.11 <NA> and this is even more dangerous well <unk> it 's dangerous again why <unk> because the temes are selfish replicators and they don 't care about
