NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 47.84 49.75 <NA> what is complex well
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 53.16 57.71 <NA> <unk> something complicated comprises many small parts <unk> all different 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 57.71 63.52 <NA> and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery on the opposite

NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 130.13 135.7 <NA> it 's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 135.42 142.75 <NA> i call this simplifying complexity and it 's what we do at the chair of systems design at eth zurich

NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 204.9 210.25 <NA> <unk> it was very very complicated <unk> but it worked beautifully in our test room <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 210.12 216.58 <NA> and on demo day professors had assembled to grade the project so we took er 1 to the evaluation room it
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 216.24 224.93 <NA> turned out the light in that room was slightly different <unk> the robot 's vision system got confused at the first bend in the line <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 226.15 227.96 <NA> <unk> and crashed into a wall 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 228.13 236.39 <NA> we had spent weeks building it and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 236.11 244.92 <NA> that 's when i realized that the more complicated you make a machine the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 244.92 249.98 <NA> and i decided that in fact i didn 't really want to create complicated stuff <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 249.58 254.91 <NA> i wanted to understand complexity the complexity of the world around us and
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 254.84 259.59 <NA> <unk> especially in the animal kingdom which brings us to bats 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 259.97 267.48 <NA> bechstein 's bats are a common species of european bats they are very social animals mostly they roost or sleep together <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 267.89 277.93 <NA> and they live in maternity colonies which means that every spring <unk> the females meet after the winter hibernation <unk> and they stay together for about six months to rear their young
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 280.04 292.31 <NA> carry a very small chip <unk> which means that every time one of them enters enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes <unk> we know where she is and more importantly we know with whom she is 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 292.31 296.02 <NA> so i study roosting associations in bats <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 295.68 297.94 <NA> and this is what it looks like <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 298.26 304.94 <NA> during the day <unk> the bats roost in a number of sub groups in different boxes <unk> it could be that on one day

NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 307.18 319.43 <NA> but on another day <unk> it could be together in a single box or split between three or more boxes <unk> and that all seems rather erratic really it 's called fission fusion dynamics <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 319 329.97 <NA> the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups <unk> so what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 330.02 339.78 <NA> <unk> together to extract a long term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 339.53 343.44 <NA> okay <unk> so that 's what this picture looks like <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 343.76 349.29 <NA> in this network all the circles are nodes individual bats <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 348.89 354.25 <NA> and the lines between them are social bonds <unk> associations between individuals
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 354.96 357.32 <NA> <unk> out this is a very interesting picture 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 357.08 365.24 <NA> this bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission fusion dynamics <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 365.24 368.65 <NA> we call them cryptic social units <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 368.46 374.93 <NA> even more interesting in fact every year <unk> around october <unk> the colony splits up <unk> and all
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 377.2 384.17 <NA> <unk> but year after year <unk> when the bats come together again in the spring <unk> the communities stay the same 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 383.92 388.73 <NA> so these bats remember their friends for a really long time 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 388.36 397.61 <NA> with a brain the size of a peanut <unk> they maintain individualized long term social bonds <unk> we didn 't know that was possible 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 397.12 404.94 <NA> we knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that but compared to bats they have huge brains so
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 405.01 413.58 <NA> how could it be that the bats maintain this complex stable social structure with such limited cognitive cognitive abilities <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 413.3 416.85 <NA> and this is where complexity brings an answer 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 416.48 418.5 <NA> to understand this system 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 418.49 427.89 <NA> we built a computer model of roosting <unk> based on simple individual rules <unk> and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony it

NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 430.17 432.19 <NA> <unk> but it 's not complicated 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 431.91 442.93 <NA> what the model told us is that in a nutshell each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 442.95 451.42 <NA> simple <unk> individual rules this is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats <unk> but it gets better 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 451.38 454.88 <NA> between two thousand and ten and two thousand and eleven the
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 454.84 460.58 <NA> <unk> colony lost more than two thirds of its members probably due to the very cold winter 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 460.6 469.67 <NA> the next spring <unk> it didn 't form two communities like every year <unk> which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 469.33 475.19 <NA> instead it formed a single cohesive social unit 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 474.85 479.97 <NA> which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 480.59 492.93 <NA> what we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this all they do is follow simple association rules <unk> and from this simplicity emerges social complexity
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 492.47 499.99 <NA> which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure <unk> and i find this incredible
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 501.9 509.89 <NA> <unk> to tell you another story but for this we have to travel from europe to the kalahari desert in south africa this is where meerkats live i 'm sure
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 509.97 513.52 <NA> you know meerkats they 're fascinating creatures
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 513.33 516.71 <NA> they live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy <unk>
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 516.47 524.38 <NA> there is one dominant pair and many subordinates some acting as sentinels some acting as babysitters some teaching pups and so on 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 524.37 529.55 <NA> what we do is put very small gps collars on these animals
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 529.96 534.5 <NA> <unk> how they move together and what this has to do with their social structure 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 534.64 538.91 <NA> and there 's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 538.75 545.75 <NA> in the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road on this road there are cars <unk> so it 's dangerous <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 545.62 550.02 <NA> but the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 550.82 552.06 <NA> <unk> so we asked 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 551.72 555.31 <NA> how exactly do they do this 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 555.07 565.56 <NA> we found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road <unk> but when it comes to crossing it crossing the road she gives way to the subordinates 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 565.56 569.7 <NA> a manner of saying go ahead tell me if it 's safe 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 570.11 577.62 <NA> what i didn 't know in fact was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 577.58 579.97 <NA> and if simple rules were sufficient
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 580.05 581.29 <NA> <unk> to explain it <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 581.37 583.36 <NA> so i built a model 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 583.11 587.68 <NA> a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 587.31 596.8 <NA> it 's a simplistic model moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment they simply move together <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 596.73 605 <NA> when these particles get to the road <unk> they sense some kind of obstacle <unk> and they bounce against it the only difference
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 605.19 616.01 <NA> between the dominant female <unk> here in red <unk> and the other individuals is that for her <unk> the height of the obstacle <unk> which is in fact the risk perceived from the road is just slightly higher <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 615.55 623.06 <NA> and this tiny difference in the individual 's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe that
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 622.57 628.86 <NA> the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 630.23 638.82 <NA> <unk> george box who was an english statistician <unk> once wrote all models are false <unk> but some models are useful 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 638.63 640.84 <NA> and in fact <unk> this model
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 640.65 649.78 <NA> is obviously false <unk> because in reality meerkats are anything but random particles but it 's also useful because it tells us that extreme
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 652.38 653.87 <NA> <unk> at the individual level
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 653.69 657.97 <NA> can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 657.84 666.04 <NA> so again that 's simplifying complexity <unk> i would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 666.09 668.21 <NA> when the dominant female
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 667.88 671.56 <NA> gives way to a subordinate it 's not out of courtesy <unk> 
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 671.52 679.07 <NA> in fact the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group if she dies on the road <unk> the whole group is at risk
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 679.9 686.12 <NA> <unk> behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response these meerkats
NicolasPerony_2013X 1 NicolasPerony_2013X 685.63 696.41 <NA> are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old and they 're adapting it to a modern risk <unk> in this case a road built by humans <unk>
