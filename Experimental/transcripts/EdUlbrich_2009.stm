EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 12.31 17.7 <NA> <unk> i 'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 17.49 21.71 <NA> that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 22.06 28.92 <NA> and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization <unk> so i want to show you a clip of the film now hopefully it won 't stutter
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 29.9 33.61 <NA> <unk> and if we did our jobs well <unk> you won 't know that we were even involved
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 76.8 79.49 <NA> <unk> there were many changes some you could
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 80.38 88.4 <NA> some you couldn 't hair started growing in all sorts of places along with other things <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 89.5 92.75 <NA> i felt pretty good considering ed ulbrich 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 94.24 100.2 <NA> that was a clip from the curious case of benjamin button many of you <unk> maybe you 've seen it or you 've heard of the story
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 100.67 110.91 <NA> <unk> but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film the main character benjamin button who 's played by brad pitt is completely computer generated from the neck up 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 110.51 119.01 <NA> now <unk> there 's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor 's body <unk> we 've created a completely digital human head 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 119 123.97 <NA> so i 'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project this is based on an f scott fitzgerald short story
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 123.76 129.97 <NA> it 's about a man who 's born old and lives his life in reverse now this movie has floated around hollywood for
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 130.13 137.76 <NA> well over half a century and we first got involved with the project in the early ' 90s with ron howard as the director we took a lot of meetings and
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 137.54 141.41 <NA> we seriously considered it but at the time we had to throw in the towel <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 141.2 147.37 <NA> it was deemed impossible it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards backwards 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 147.37 153.14 <NA> the human form in particular the human head has been considered the holy grail of our industry
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 155.02 161.93 <NA> <unk> came back to us about a decade later and this time with a director named david fincher now <unk> fincher is is an interesting guy 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 161.98 170.52 <NA> david is fearless of technology and he is absolutely tenacious <unk> and david won 't take no and david believed like we do
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 170.29 174.9 <NA> in the visual effects industry <unk> that anything is possible as long as you have enough
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 175.49 177.96 <NA> <unk> resources and of course money 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 178.25 191.52 <NA> and so david had an interesting take on the film <unk> and he threw a challenge at us he wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor <unk> it happened to be this guy <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 191.52 195.51 <NA> we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 195.08 205 <NA> with david and we ruled out of course swapping actors that was one idea that we would have different actors and we would hand off from actor to actor we even ruled out the idea of using makeup we realized that prosthetic
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 204.96 207.25 <NA> <unk> makeup just wouldn 't hold up <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 207.06 216.09 <NA> particularly in close up and makeup is an additive process you have to build the face up and david wanted to carve deeply into brad 's face to bring the aging to this character <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 216.09 218.68 <NA> he needed to be a very sympathetic character
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 218.85 228.38 <NA> <unk> so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 229.99 235.08 <NA> <unk> 's head aged to appear as benjamin and attach that to the body of the real actor <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 235.08 243.78 <NA> sounded great of course <unk> this was the holy grail of our our industry <unk> and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn 't help
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 243.55 250.17 <NA> either because i 'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store <unk> you know we see his face constantly so there really was no tolerable
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 250.13 251.22 <NA> <unk> margin of error
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 250.99 263.52 <NA> there were two studios involved <unk> warner brothers and paramount <unk> and they both believed this would make an amazing film of course but it was a very high risk proposition there was lots of money and reputations at stake
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 263.09 268.74 <NA> <unk> but we believed that we had a very solid methodology that
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 268.31 274.02 <NA> might work <unk> but despite our verbal assurances they wanted some proof
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 273.74 279.97 <NA> and so in two thousand and four they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin <unk> and we did it in about five
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 280.02 281.08 <NA> <unk> weeks <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 280.71 292.6 <NA> but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts we basically put something together to get through the meeting i 'll roll that for you now this was the first test for benjamin button <unk> and in here you can see that 's a computer generated head
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 292.11 297.82 <NA> pretty good attached to the body of an actor <unk> and it worked <unk> and it gave the studio
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 297.82 304.73 <NA> great relief after many years of starts and stops on this project and making that tough decision they
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 304.66 313.79 <NA> <unk> finally decided to greenlight the movie and i can remember actually when i got the phone call to congratulate us to say the movie was a go i actually threw up you
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 315.76 324.99 <NA> this is some tough stuff <unk> so we started to have early team meetings and we got everybody together and it was really more like therapy in the beginning <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 325.49 334.77 <NA> <unk> convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character and it 's not a special effects film it has to be a man
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 334.55 343.2 <NA> <unk> we really felt like we were in a kind of a 12 step program <unk> and of course the first step is admit you 've got a problem 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 343.1 344.52 <NA> so
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 344.45 350.08 <NA> we had a big problem we didn 't know how we were going to do this <unk> but we did know one thing
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 350 358.42 <NA> being from the visual effects industry we with david believed that we now had enough time enough resources and god we hoped we had enough money
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 358.56 371.9 <NA> <unk> and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence <unk> so <unk> when you 're faced with something like that of course you 've got to break it down you take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that so we had three main areas that we had to focus on 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 371.9 374.93 <NA> we needed to make brad look a lot older needed to age
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 377.44 381.29 <NA> <unk> and we also needed to make sure that we could take brad
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 380.8 381.8 <NA> 's
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 381.63 391.5 <NA> idiosyncrasies his little tics the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen <unk> and we also needed to create
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 391.26 404.97 <NA> a character that could hold up under really all conditions <unk> he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at nighttime under candlelight he had to hold an extreme close up he had to deliver dialogue he had to be able to run he had to be able to sweat he had to be able to take a bath to cry
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 405.28 408.69 <NA> <unk> he even had to throw up not all at the same time but he had to you know 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 408.2 422.06 <NA> do all of those things <unk> and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we did about three hundred and twenty five shots <unk> so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 422.06 429.49 <NA> and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in two thousand and four and where we needed it to be
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 430.01 440.53 <NA> we focused on motion capture <unk> i 'm sure many of you have seen motion capture <unk> the state of the art at the time was something called marker based motion capture i 'll give you an example here it 's basically the idea of you wear a leotard <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 440.48 448.85 <NA> and they put some reflective markers on your body <unk> and instead of using cameras there 're infrared sensors around a volume <unk> and those infrared sensors track the
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 450.64 461.06 <NA> <unk> in real time and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character you can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 461.06 471.93 <NA> as the dancers but we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that 's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process and as you can see it gives you a
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 471.69 475.05 <NA> pretty crappy performance that
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 475 485.31 <NA> 's not terribly compelling <unk> and what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers we needed the the subtleties of the skin we needed to see skin moving <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 485.21 495.48 <NA> <unk> over muscle moving over bone we needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 495.43 503.32 <NA> <unk> the state of the art <unk> so we aborted using motion capture <unk> and we were now well out of our comfort zone <unk> and in uncharted territory
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 505.05 507.53 <NA> <unk> we were left with this idea that we ended up calling 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 507.53 515.9 <NA> technology stew we started to look out in other fields <unk> the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 515.72 522.2 <NA> come from other industries like medical imaging the video game space <unk> and re appropriate them <unk> and
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 522.01 525.4 <NA> we had to create kind of a sauce and the sauce was
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 525.15 529.94 <NA> code in software that we 'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 529.9 539.15 <NA> <unk> together and and work as one <unk> <unk> initially we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named dr paul ekman in the early ' 70s he believed
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 538.72 549.87 <NA> that he could in fact catalog the human face and he came up with this idea of facial action coding system or facs he believed that there were seventy basic poses or shapes of the
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 552.41 560.1 <NA> <unk> those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing <unk> and of course
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 559.85 570.45 <NA> <unk> these transcend age race culture gender <unk> so this became the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 570.4 576.13 <NA> <unk> and here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face and now what we 're looking at is really
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 580.02 583.6 <NA> <unk> of a computer array of cameras <unk> and those cameras can
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 583.23 589.45 <NA> frame by frame reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject 's doing at the moment so effectively you get
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 589.22 600.31 <NA> 3d data in real time of the subject <unk> and if you look in a comparison on the left we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us so clearly <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 600.26 604.58 <NA> we were in a substantially better place for this but these were the early days of this technology
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 604.99 607.7 <NA> <unk> proven yet <unk> we measure
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 607.54 612.08 <NA> complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count <unk> and so
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 611.74 624.02 <NA> <unk> on the left we were seeing one hundred thousand polygons we could go up into the millions of polygons it seemed to be infinite this was when we had our aha this was the breakthrough this is when we 're like ok we 're going to be ok this is actually going to work 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 623.53 624.81 <NA> and
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 625.82 629.76 <NA> <unk> what if we could take brad pitt <unk> and we could put brad
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 629.39 631.23 <NA> in this device
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 631.06 641.58 <NA> <unk> and use this contour process and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights <unk> and we could in fact scan him in real time performing ekman 's facs poses <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 641.53 648.48 <NA> right so <unk> effectively we ended up with a 3d database of everything brad pitt 's face is capable of doing 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 650 660.17 <NA> from there we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face so we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 660.12 670.27 <NA> <unk> a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of of doing now <unk> that 's great except we had him at age forty four we need to put another forty years on him at this point we <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 670.17 679.4 <NA> <unk> brought in rick baker <unk> and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry <unk> and we also brought in a gentleman named kazu tsuji and kazu tsuji is one of the great
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 680.1 683.64 <NA> sculptors of our time <unk> and we commissioned them to make a
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 683.43 692.68 <NA> a maquette or a bust of benjamin <unk> so in the spirit of the great unveiling i had to do this i had to unveil something <unk> so this is ben eighty
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 694.42 700.16 <NA> we created three of these there 's ben eighty there 's ben seventy there 's ben sixty <unk> and this really became
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 701.81 705.96 <NA> <unk> this was made from a life cast of brad so in fact
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 705.5 717.93 <NA> <unk> anatomically it is correct the eyes the jaw the teeth everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has we have these maquettes scanned into the computer at at very high resolution enormous polygonal count
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 717.68 719.73 <NA> <unk> and so now we had
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 719.33 725.52 <NA> three age increments of benjamin in the computer <unk> but we needed to get
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 725.51 729.64 <NA> a database of him doing more than that we went through this process then called retargeting
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 729.93 740.5 <NA> <unk> this is brad doing one of the ekman facs poses and here 's the resulting data that comes from that the model that comes from that retargeting is the process of transposing that data <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 740.45 749.26 <NA> onto another model and because the life cast or the bust the maquette of benjamin was made from brad we could transpose the data
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 754.84 764.96 <NA> <unk> everything brad pitt 's face can do at age eighty seven in his 70s and in his 60s next we had to go into the shooting process so while all that 's going on we 're down in new orleans and locations around the <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 764.86 770.34 <NA> <unk> world and we shot our body actors and we shot them wearing blue hoods so these are the gentleman who played benjamin 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 779.9 788.73 <NA> <unk> now we needed to get brad 's performance to drive our virtual benjamin <unk> and so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the the rest of the cast and
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 788.51 790.33 <NA> the body actors
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 789.91 794.18 <NA> and about six months later we brought brad onto a sound stage in los angeles
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 794.02 796.78 <NA> and he watched on the screen
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 796.78 804.85 <NA> his job then was to become benjamin <unk> and so we looped the scenes he watched again and again we encouraged him to improvise <unk> and he took
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 804.78 808.08 <NA> <unk> benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn 't think he was going to go 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 808.09 818.03 <NA> we shot him with four hd cameras so we 'd get multiple views of him and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 817.85 827.54 <NA> from there we went into a process called image analysis <unk> and so here you can see again <unk> the chosen take <unk> and you are seeing now that data being transposed on to ben
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 830.05 840.53 <NA> <unk> about this is we used something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjamin 's face and so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well in frame fourteen <unk>
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 840.43 853.07 <NA> <unk> the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here and it concludes moving in frame thirty two and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from and then the sauce i talked about with our technology stew that secret sauce
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 854.81 859.35 <NA> <unk> to match the performance footage of brad in live action
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 859.07 866.61 <NA> with our database of aged benjamin the facs shapes that we had on a frame by frame basis we could actually reconstruct
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 866.41 874.32 <NA> a 3d head that exactly matched the performance of brad <unk> so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film <unk> 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 874.04 879.97 <NA> and here you can see the body actor <unk> and then this is what we called the dead head no reference to jerry garcia
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 880.22 881.53 <NA> <unk> and
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 881.1 886.96 <NA> then here 's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance and then again <unk> the final shot it
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 887.91 889.78 <NA> was a long process 
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 901.78 907.04 <NA> <unk> next section here <unk> i 'm going to just blast through this because we could do a whole tedtalk on the next
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 906.55 914.81 <NA> several slides <unk> we had to create a lighting system so really a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 914.81 916.91 <NA> benjamin had to appear so that
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 916.48 925.05 <NA> we could put ben 's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that 's on the other actors in the real world <unk> we also had to create an eye system <unk> we found
EdUlbrich_2009 1 EdUlbrich_2009 926.39 936.57 <NA> <unk> the eyes are the window to the soul absolutely true so the key here was to keep everybody looking in ben 's eyes <unk> and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel his intent coming through the <unk>
