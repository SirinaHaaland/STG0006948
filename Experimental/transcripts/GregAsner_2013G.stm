GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 58.65 66.79 <NA> and what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be they just use a different strategy <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 66.33 72.23 <NA> whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances usually during the day

GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 419.72 429.1 <NA> we can go to one of the smallest tropical countries panama and see also a huge range of carbon variation from high in red to low in blue
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 430.11 438.58 <NA> <unk> most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands <unk> but what you see that 's left in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds is the stuff that 's up in the mountains 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 438.15 451.72 <NA> one interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen <unk> you 're seeing the buffer zone around the panama canal that 's in the reds and yellows the canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 451.62 454.97 <NA> this kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 455.34 461.39 <NA> and resource policy development it 's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 461.41 467.63 <NA> my second question how do we prepare for climate change in a place like the amazon rainforest <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 467.17 477.89 <NA> let me tell you i spend a lot of time in these places and we 're seeing the climate changing already <unk> temperatures are increasing <unk> and what 's really happening is we 're getting a lot of droughts <unk> recurring droughts

GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 483.05 492.18 <NA> the amazon was so dry in two thousand and ten that even the main stem of the amazon river itself dried up partially as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 493.19 500.17 <NA> what we found is that in very remote areas these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 501.06 514 <NA> <unk> for example these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the two thousand and ten drought this area happens to be on the border of peru and brazil <unk> totally unexplored <unk> almost totally unknown scientifically 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 514.29 528.4 <NA> so what we think as earth scientists is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in brazil all the way west into the andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 528.33 529.91 <NA> one of the problems with
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 529.81 534.41 <NA> <unk> this is that humans are taking apart the western amazon as we speak look at this <unk>
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 535.62 538.85 <NA> gash in the forest created by gold miners 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 538.39 545.4 <NA> you see the forest in green in 3d and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 545.4 549.2 <NA> species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this obviously <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 549.52 554.61 <NA> if you haven 't been to the amazon you should go it 's an amazing experience every time
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 554.84 559.47 <NA> <unk> matter where you go you 're going to probably see it this way on a river <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 559.04 565.26 <NA> but what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what 's really going on back in the forest itself 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 565.52 574.9 <NA> we flew over this same river imaged the system in 3d the forest is on the left and then we can digitally remove the forest and see what 's going on below the
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 575.76 585.64 <NA> <unk> and in this case we found gold mining activity all of it illegal set back away from the river 's edge as you 'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 586.02 590.45 <NA> don 't worry we 're working with the authorities to deal with this and many many other problems
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 590.26 600.11 <NA> in the region <unk> so in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique important corridors like the western amazon and the andes amazon
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 600.94 602.79 <NA> <unk> we have to start making
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 602.61 611.27 <NA> geographically explicit plans now how do we do that if we don 't know the geography of biodiversity in the region if it 's so unknown to science <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 610.87 619.5 <NA> so what we 've been doing is using the laser guided spectroscopy from the cao to map for the first time the biodiversity of the amazon rainforest <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 619.5 625.11 <NA> here you see actual data showing different species in different colors reds are one type of species blues
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 625.13 627.24 <NA> <unk> are another and greens are yet another <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 627.29 631.56 <NA> and when we take this together and scale up to the regional level 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 631.25 638.49 <NA> we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 638.24 649.69 <NA> this tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat and that 's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate

GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 660.6 666.82 <NA> and third and final question is how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 666.82 671.54 <NA> the example i started out with about lions hunting that was a study we did

GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 691.99 699.98 <NA> some of their decisions have really big impacts for example how much and where to use fire as a management tool 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 700.55 709.39 <NA> <unk> how to deal with a large species like elephants <unk> which may if their populations get too large have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species <unk> 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 709.18 713.78 <NA> and let me tell you these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape

GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 742.38 749.99 <NA> but what 's good is that the technology we 've developed and we 're working with in south africa for example is allowing us to map every single tree
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 751.09 761.91 <NA> <unk> and then through repeat flights we 're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants in the red as you see on the screen <unk> and how much that 's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 761.91 772.28 <NA> that 's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don 't lead to those extremes that i just showed you 
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 775.06 779.82 <NA> so really the way we 're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it
GregAsner_2013G 1 GregAsner_2013G 779.75 788.31 <NA> <unk> as tending to a circle of life where we have fire management elephant management those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem
