AdamGrant_2016S 1 AdamGrant_2016S 244.96 250.26 <NA> so i wondered then if givers are the worst performers who are the best performers
AdamGrant_2016S 1 AdamGrant_2016S 251.36 257.55 <NA> <unk> let me start with the good news <unk> it 's not the takers takers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs <unk> 
AdamGrant_2016S 1 AdamGrant_2016S 257.35 259.54 <NA> and they fall at the hands of matchers

AdamGrant_2016S 1 AdamGrant_2016S 269.12 274.93 <NA> and that way justice gets served well most people are matchers and that means if you 're a
AdamGrant_2016S 1 AdamGrant_2016S 275.28 283.72 <NA> <unk> it tends to catch up with you eventually what goes around will come around <unk> and so the logical conclusion is it must be the matchers who are the best performers <unk> 
AdamGrant_2016S 1 AdamGrant_2016S 283.32 290.47 <NA> but they 're not in every job in every organization i 've ever studied the best results belong to the givers again
