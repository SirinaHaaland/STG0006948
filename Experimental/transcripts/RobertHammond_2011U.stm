RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 25.7 28.45 <NA> <unk> because so many people were run over by the trains
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 28.24 37.32 <NA> that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front and he became known as the west side cowboy but even with a cowboy about one person

RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 87.12 95 <NA> so we exchanged business cards <unk> and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization friends of the high line <unk> 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 94.51 96.18 <NA> and the goal
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 96 104.97 <NA> at first was just saving it from demolition but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it and what first attracted me or interested me was
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 104.96 107.77 <NA> <unk> this this view from the street which is this
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 107.53 112.12 <NA> steel structure sort of rusty this industrial relic <unk> 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 112.12 119.68 <NA> but when i went up on top it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of manhattan
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 119.44 124.96 <NA> with views of the empire state building and the statue of liberty and the hudson river and that 's really where
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 125.52 130.61 <NA> <unk> the idea coalesced around let 's make this a park and let 's have it be sort of inspired
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 130.43 137.38 <NA> by this wildscape at the time there was a lot of opposition mayor giuliani wanted to tear it down
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 136.98 142.54 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to fast forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 142.14 151.03 <NA> mayor bloomberg came in office he was very supportive but we still had to make the economic case <unk> this was after nine eleven the city was in tough times 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 151.03 154.94 <NA> so we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 154.9 163.16 <NA> <unk> case and it turns out we got those numbers wrong we thought it would cost one hundred million dollars to build so far it 's cost about one hundred and fifty million <unk> 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 163.16 170.27 <NA> and the the main case was this is going to make good economic sense for the city so we said over a 20 year time period 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 169.78 179.97 <NA> the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about two hundred and fifty million that was enough it really got the city behind it it turns out
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 179.96 186.66 <NA> <unk> we were wrong on that now people estimate it 's created about a half a billion dollars or will create about a half a billion dollars
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 186.5 197.72 <NA> <unk> in tax revenues for the city we did a design competition selected a design team we worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 197.72 201.94 <NA> there 's three sections we opened the fist section in two thousand and nine 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 201.75 204.97 <NA> it 's been successful beyond our dreams
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 204.93 209.8 <NA> <unk> last year we had about two million people which is about ten times what we ever estimated 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 209.31 219.7 <NA> this is one of my favorite features in section one it 's this amphitheater right over 10th ave and the first section ends at 20th st right now the other thing it 's generated <unk>
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 219.65 224.93 <NA> obviously a lot of economic value <unk> it 's also inspired i think a lot of great architecture there 's a point
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 225.22 232.24 <NA> <unk> you can stand here and see buildings by frank gehry jean nouvel shigeru ban neil denari <unk> 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 232.25 243.32 <NA> and the whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the high line and this has been designed by renzo piano and they 're going to break ground in may <unk> 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 243.1 253.76 <NA> and we 've already started construction on section two this is one of my favorite features this flyover where you 're eight feet off the surface of the high line <unk> running through a canopy of trees 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 253.33 254.97 <NA> the high line used to be
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 255.19 263.66 <NA> covered in billboards <unk> and so we 've taken a playful take where instead of framing advertisements it 's going to frame people in views of the city 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 263.66 266.64 <NA> this was just installed last month <unk> 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 266.21 274.93 <NA> and then the last section was going to go around the rail yards which is the largest undeveloped site in manhattan and the city has planned for
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 277.77 280.39 <NA> <unk> of development that the high line is going to ring around <unk> 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 280.39 288.56 <NA> but what really i think makes the high line special is the people and honestly <unk> even though i love the designs that we were building i was always frightened
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 288.2 294.32 <NA> that i wouldn 't really love it because i fell in love with that wildscape and how could you recreate that magic 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 294.32 302.09 <NA> but what i found is it 's in the people and how they use it that to me makes it so special just one quick example
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 301.9 304.91 <NA> is i realized right after we opened that there were all these
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 304.87 310.19 <NA> <unk> people holding hands on the high line and i realized new yorkers don 't hold hands <unk> 
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 310.18 316 <NA> we just don 't do that outside <unk> but you see that happening on the high line and i think that 's
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 316 321.62 <NA> the power that that public space can have to transform how people experience their city
RobertHammond_2011U 1 RobertHammond_2011U 321.37 324.27 <NA> and interact with each other thanks
