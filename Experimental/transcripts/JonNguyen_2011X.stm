JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 12.61 22.4 <NA> <unk> as a kid <unk> i was fascinated with all things air and space i would watch nova on pbs our school would show bill nye the science guy
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 23.95 29.7 <NA> when i was in elementary school my next door neighbor he gave me a book for my birthday it was an astronomy book
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 29.84 35.91 <NA> <unk> i poured over that thing for hours on end <unk> and it was a combination of all these things
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 35.42 40.89 <NA> that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 41.27 50.35 <NA> and part of that dream was i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft <unk> well
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 50.49 58.51 <NA> <unk> a number of years later <unk> i graduated from ucla and i found myself at nasa working for the jet propulsion laboratory <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 58.23 61.55 <NA> and there our team was challenged
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 61.22 65.35 <NA> to create a 3d visualization of the solar system 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 65.1 73.43 <NA> and today i want to show you what we 've done so far now the kicker is <unk> everything i 'm about to do here
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 73.22 79.91 <NA> you can do at home because we built this for the public for you guys to use so
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 80.02 84.62 <NA> <unk> you 're looking at right now is the earth <unk> you can see the united states and california and san diego <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 84.13 93.02 <NA> and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around now this isn 't new <unk> anyone who 's used google earth has seen this before <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 93.02 102.38 <NA> but one thing we like to say in our group is <unk> we do the opposite of google earth google earth goes from this view down to your backyard 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 101.98 104.94 <NA> we go from this view out to the stars
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 105.38 110.19 <NA> so the earth is cool but what we really want to show are the spacecraft <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 109.7 113.34 <NA> so i 'm going to bring the interface back up 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 113.34 125.08 <NA> and now you 're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the earth these are a number of our science space earth orbiters <unk> we haven 't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 125.04 129.16 <NA> <unk> if we did it would be a complete mess because there 's a lot of stuff out there 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 129.3 134.85 <NA> and the cool thing is <unk> we actually created 3d models for a number of these spacecraft <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 134.86 142.72 <NA> so if you want to visit any of these all you need to do is double click on them <unk> so i 'm going to find the international space station
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 142.68 147.35 <NA> double click and it will take us all the way down to the iss <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 147.35 152.47 <NA> and now you 're riding along with the iss where it is right now <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 153.36 154.94 <NA> and the other cool thing is
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 154.98 160.64 <NA> not only can we move the camera around we can also control time <unk> so i can slide this jog dial here
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 160.64 166.16 <NA> to shuttle time forward <unk> and now we can see what a sunset on the iss would look like 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 167.2 169.73 <NA> and they get one every ninety minutes 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 172.75 175.02 <NA> all right so what about the rest of
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 175.73 185.91 <NA> <unk> i can click on this home button over here <unk> and that will take us up to the inner solar system and now we 're looking at the rest of the solar system <unk> you can see there 's saturn there 's jupiter
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 185.51 188.97 <NA> <unk> and while we 're here i want to point out something <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 188.66 195.9 <NA> it 's actually pretty busy here we have the mars science laboratory on its way to mars just launched last weekend 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 195.56 204.85 <NA> here we have juno on its cruise to jupiter <unk> there <unk> we have dawn orbiting vesta <unk> and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 204.78 208.27 <NA> <unk> pluto <unk> and i mention this because
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 208.07 212.45 <NA> there 's this strange public perception that nasa 's dead 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 212.27 216.47 <NA> that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there 's no more spacecraft out there <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 216.47 225.11 <NA> well a lot of what nasa does is robotic exploration <unk> and we have a lot of spacecraft out there <unk> granted we 're not sending humans
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 227.02 231.32 <NA> <unk> with our own launch vehicles but nasa is far from dead <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 231.28 237.98 <NA> and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there 's so many other things that we 're doing <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 238.15 246.53 <NA> anyway while we 're here again if you want to visit anything all you need to do is double click so i 'm just going to <unk> double click on vesta <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 246.88 252.53 <NA> and here we have dawn orbiting vesta <unk> and this is happening right now <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 255.1 256.93 <NA> <unk> and we can see
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 256.93 265.57 <NA> uranus rotating on its side along with its moons <unk> you can see how it 's tilted at about eighty nine degrees <unk> and
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 265.12 276.45 <NA> just being able to visit different places and go through different times we have data from one thousand nine hundred and fifty to two thousand and fifty granted we don 't have everything in between because some of the data is hard to get 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 276.74 279.97 <NA> just being able to visit places in different times
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 282.17 285.79 <NA> you can explore this for hours literally hours on end <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 285.66 294.55 <NA> but i want to show you one thing in particular <unk> so i 'm going to open up the destination tab spacecraft outer planet missions voyager one 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 294.18 297.25 <NA> and i 'm going to bring up the titan flyby <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 297.51 300.08 <NA> so now we 've gone back in time
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 301.39 307.13 <NA> <unk> we 're now riding along with voyager one the date here is november eleven one thousand nine hundred and eighty 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 307.03 309.56 <NA> now there 's a funny thing going on here <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 309.1 319.02 <NA> it doesn 't look like anything 's going on it looks like i 've paused the program <unk> it 's actually running at real rate right now <unk> one second per second and in fact voyager one here
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 319.46 321.8 <NA> flying by titan at
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 321.58 329.97 <NA> i think it 's thirty eight thousand miles per hour <unk> it only looks like nothing 's moving because well saturn here is seven hundred thousand miles
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 329.96 337.5 <NA> <unk> away <unk> and titan here is four thousand to five thousand miles away it 's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing 's happening <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 337.61 345 <NA> but to make it more interesting i 'm going to speed up time <unk> and we can watch as voyager one flies by titan 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 344.84 349.32 <NA> which is a hazy moon of saturn it actually has a very thick atmosphere <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 349.19 352.77 <NA> and i 'm going to recenter the camera on saturn here <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 353.09 354.73 <NA> i 'm going to pull out
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 355.11 356.89 <NA> <unk> i want to show you
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 356.49 359.26 <NA> voyager one as it flies by saturn <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 359.46 364.76 <NA> there 's a point to be made here with a 3d visualization like this 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 364.52 374.78 <NA> we can not only just say voyager one flew by saturn <unk> there 's a whole story to tell here and even better because it 's an interactive application <unk> you can tell the story for yourself <unk>
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 374.78 379.97 <NA> if you want to pause it <unk> you can pause it if you want to keep going if you want to change the camera angle you can do that
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 380.68 388.25 <NA> and because of that i can show you that voyager one doesn 't just fly by saturn <unk> it actually flies
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 388.05 389.99 <NA> underneath saturn <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 390.43 399.38 <NA> now what happens is as it flies underneath saturn <unk> saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 398.92 401.81 <NA> so if i just keep letting this go <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 401.53 404.03 <NA> you can see voyager one
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 403.97 404.97 <NA> fly up
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 404.99 414.6 <NA> <unk> like that and in fact i 'm going to go back to the solar system <unk> i 'm going to go back to today now <unk> and i want to show you where voyager one is 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 414.68 416.88 <NA> right there <unk> 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 416.75 422.22 <NA> above way above the solar system <unk> way beyond our solar system 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 421.91 429.43 <NA> and here 's the thing now you know how it got there <unk> now you know why and to me that 's the point of this program <unk> you can
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 430.14 435.34 <NA> <unk> manipulate it yourself <unk> you can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 435.18 441.35 <NA> you know the theme today is the world in your grasp well <unk> we 're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 441.35 447.65 <NA> and we hope once it 's there you 'll be able to learn for yourself what we 've done out there and what we 're about to do 
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 447.42 450.56 <NA> and my personal dream is for kids
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 450.4 454.94 <NA> to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired
JonNguyen_2011X 1 JonNguyen_2011X 455.11 460.86 <NA> <unk> as i was as a kid to pursue stem education and to pursue a dream in space exploration
