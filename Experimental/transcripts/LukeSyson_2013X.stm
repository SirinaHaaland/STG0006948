LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 384.94 393.59 <NA> there was a sort of idea really that if you owned a vase like this then there was really only one fate possible 
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 397.24 400.05 <NA> so there i was in
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 402.77 409.14 <NA> <unk> i took the job and i went on looking at these vases i sort of had to because they 're on a through route

LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 428.49 432.97 <NA> <unk> what i started with was was understanding this as really
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 432.57 444.25 <NA> a supreme piece of of design it took me a little time but that tutu for example actually this is a piece that does dance in its own way <unk> it has an extraordinary lightness and yet it is also amazing balanced <unk> 
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 444.25 447.11 <NA> it has these kinds of sculptural ingredients
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 446.9 454.7 <NA> <unk> <unk> and then the play between actually really quite carefully disposed color and gilding and the sculptural surface is really
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 454.87 456.32 <NA> <unk> really rather remarkable <unk> 
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 456.32 470.15 <NA> and then i realized that this piece went into the kiln four times at least four times in order to arrive at this how many moments for accident can you think of that could have happened to this piece and then remember <unk> not just one but two so <unk>
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 471.28 474.96 <NA> <unk> he 's having to arrive at two exactly matched vases of this

LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 504.87 510.85 <NA> <unk> sense for me <unk> encapsulated this object actually comes from the same root as the word <unk> ' fantasy '
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 510.96 519.2 <NA> and that what this object was just as much in a way <unk> in its own way as a leonardo da vinci painting is a portal to somewhere else this is
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 529.99 539.09 <NA> <unk> if you think about divans and perhaps even <unk> opium induced visions of pink elephants then at that point this object starts to make
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 538.66 546.92 <NA> sense this is an object which is all about escapism it 's about an escapism that that happens
LukeSyson_2013X 1 LukeSyson_2013X 546.43 549.93 <NA> that the aristocracy in france sought very deliberately
