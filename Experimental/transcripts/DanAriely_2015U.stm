DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 17.13 24.75 <NA> the problem is that we have these color tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations

DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 28.61 38.62 <NA> if i gave you a few beers to taste and i asked you to rate them on intensity and bitterness different beers would occupy different space <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 38.41 45.87 <NA> but what if we tried to be objective about it in the case of beer it would be very simple what if we did a blind taste <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 45.87 52.51 <NA> well if we did the same thing you tasted the same beer now in the blind taste things would look slightly different <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 52.28 54.85 <NA> most of the beers will go into one place

DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 65.05 74.84 <NA> what happens when people expect something from their physiology <unk> for example we sold people pain medications some people we told them the medications were expensive some people we told them it was
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 75.49 84.92 <NA> <unk> and the expensive pain medication worked better it relieved more pain from people because expectations do change our physiology <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 84.43 92.67 <NA> and of course we all know that in sports if you are a fan of a particular team you can 't help but see the game develop from the perspective
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 92.5 99.96 <NA> of your team <unk> so all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions and our expectations

DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 103.82 115.23 <NA> important questions what happened with questions that had to do with social justice <unk> so we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version for thinking about inequality <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 114.86 121.87 <NA> so we started looking at inequality and we did some large scale surveys around the u s and other countries <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 121.87 129.94 <NA> so we asked two questions do people know what kind of level of inequality we have and then what level of inequality do we want
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 130.13 131.26 <NA> to have 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 131.13 133.93 <NA> so let 's think about the first question <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 133.47 141.34 <NA> imagine i took all the people in the u s and i sorted them from the poorest on the right to the richest on the left <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 140.85 148.9 <NA> and then i divided them into five buckets <unk> the poorest twenty percent the next twenty percent the next the next and the richest twenty percent <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 148.77 154.79 <NA> and then i asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think is concentrated in each of those buckets
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 154.9 164.21 <NA> <unk> so to make it simpler <unk> imagine i ask you to tell me how much wealth do you think is concentrated in the bottom two buckets <unk> the bottom forty percent <unk>
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 163.93 168.3 <NA> take a second think about it and have a number usually we don 't
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 167.94 172.55 <NA> think think for a second have a real number in your mind you have it 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 172.63 179.97 <NA> okay here 's what lots of americans tell us they think that the bottom twenty percent has about two point nine percent of the wealth
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 180.22 186.67 <NA> <unk> the next group has six point four <unk> so together it 's slightly more than nine <unk> the next group
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 186.43 189.87 <NA> they say has twelve percent twenty percent <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 189.64 197.79 <NA> and the richest twenty percent people think has fifty eight percent of the wealth <unk> you can see how this relates to what you thought now
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 197.78 204.94 <NA> what 's reality reality is slightly different <unk> the bottom twenty percent has zero point one percent of the wealth
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 204.95 214.34 <NA> the next twenty percent has zero point two percent of the wealth <unk> together it 's zero point three <unk> the next group has three point nine

DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 219.96 224.93 <NA> <unk> percent of the wealth <unk> so what we actually have and what we think we
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 227.32 230.82 <NA> <unk> what about what we want <unk> how do we even figure this out <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 230.58 238.75 <NA> so to look at this to look at what we really want <unk> we thought about the philosopher john rawls if you remember john rawls <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 238.76 242.25 <NA> he had this notion of what 's a just society 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 242.06 249.47 <NA> he said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it you would be willing to enter it in a random place <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 250.91 259.95 <NA> <unk> because if you 're wealthy you might want the wealthy to have more money the poor to have less if you 're poor you might want more equality but if you 're going to go into that society
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 259.67 264.54 <NA> in every possible situation and you don 't know you have to consider all the aspects 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 264.54 274.11 <NA> it 's a little bit like blind tasting in which you don 't know what the outcome will be when you make a decision <unk> and rawls called this the veil of ignorance 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 273.86 275.05 <NA> so 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 275.45 287.41 <NA> another group a large group of americans and we asked them the question in the veil of ignorance <unk> what are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it knowing that you could end randomly at any place <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 287.41 296.32 <NA> and here is what we got <unk> what did people want to give to the first group the bottom twenty percent <unk> they wanted to give them about ten percent of the wealth <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 295.83 299 <NA> the next group <unk> fourteen percent of the wealth
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 305.14 312.35 <NA> <unk> in our sample wanted full equality <unk> nobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 312.46 322.35 <NA> but what does it mean it means that we have this knowledge gap between what we have and what we think we have <unk> but we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 322.14 329.7 <NA> to what we think we have now we can ask these questions by the way not just about wealth we can ask it about other things as well
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 330.2 340.62 <NA> <unk> so for example <unk> we asked people from different parts of the world about this question people who are liberals and conservatives <unk> and they gave us basically the same answer <unk>
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 340.57 347.04 <NA> we asked rich and poor they gave us the same answer <unk> men and women <unk> npr listeners and forbes readers
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 350.46 357.78 <NA> <unk> very similar answers we even asked different departments of a university we went to harvard and we checked almost every department 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 357.79 367.34 <NA> and in fact from harvard business school where a few people wanted the wealthy to have more and the [ poor ] to have less <unk> the similarity was astonishing i know some of you went to
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 367.01 369.49 <NA> harvard business school <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 369.12 376.6 <NA> we also asked this question about something else we asked what about the ratio of ceo pay to unskilled workers <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 376.6 379.64 <NA> so you can see what people think is the ratio
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 379.9 384.11 <NA> and then we can ask the question what do they think should be the ratio <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 383.92 386.9 <NA> and then we can ask what is reality <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 386.56 391.65 <NA> what is reality and you could say well it 's not that bad right the red and the yellow are not that different 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 391.65 395.09 <NA> but the fact is it 's because i didn 't draw them on the same scale <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 397.45 400.02 <NA> it 's hard to see there 's yellow and blue in there
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 402.14 408.84 <NA> <unk> what about other outcomes of wealth <unk> wealth is not just about wealth we asked what about things like health <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 408.65 412.47 <NA> what about availability of prescription medication <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 412.47 419.37 <NA> what about life expectancy what about life expectancy of infants how do we want this to be distributed
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 418.97 422.76 <NA> what about education for young people and
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 422.76 429.94 <NA> for older people and across all of those things what we learned was that people don 't like inequality of wealth
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 430.1 439.45 <NA> <unk> but there 's other things where inequality which is an outcome of wealth is even more aversive to them for example inequality in health or education <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 439.14 446.63 <NA> we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 446.42 454.97 <NA> basically young kids and babies because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation <unk> so what are some lessons
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 454.96 456.11 <NA> <unk> from this 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 455.62 466.83 <NA> we have two gaps we have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap and the knowledge gap is something that we think about how do we educate people how do we get people to think differently about inequality
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 466.5 472.49 <NA> and the consequences of inequality in terms of health education jealousy crime rate and so on 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 472.33 479.61 <NA> then we have the desirability gap how do we get people to think differently about what we really want you see the rawls
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 480.23 490.59 <NA> <unk> the rawls way of looking at the world the blind tasting approach <unk> takes our selfish motivation out of the picture how do we implement that to a higher degree on a more extensive
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 490.19 491.46 <NA> scale <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 491.23 497.7 <NA> and finally we also have an action gap how do we take these things and actually do something about it i
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 497.69 504.97 <NA> think part of the answer is to think about people like young kids and babies that don 't have much agency because people seem to be more
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 505.02 507.04 <NA> <unk> willing to do this 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 507.15 512.86 <NA> to summarize i would say next time you go to drink beer or wine
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 512.86 517.07 <NA> first of all think about what is it in your experience that is real 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 516.84 521.71 <NA> and what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect coming from expectations <unk> 
DanAriely_2015U 1 DanAriely_2015U 521.25 529.07 <NA> and then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us <unk> thanks a lot
