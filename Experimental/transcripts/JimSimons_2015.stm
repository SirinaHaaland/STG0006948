JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1180.02 1187.86 <NA> <unk> are two very very interesting questions the first question is a tortuous path from

JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1198.02 1200.02 <NA> is a star in

JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1213.54 1214.93 <NA> so 
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1214.93 1224.02 <NA> in steady state there are about two million stars in formation at any time that one is somewhere along this settling down period 
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1223.56 1228.38 <NA> and there 's all this crap sort of circling around it dust and stuff
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1230.11 1233.81 <NA> <unk> probably a solar system or whatever it forms but here 's the thing
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1234.22 1238.19 <NA> in this dust that
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1238.09 1242.72 <NA> surrounds a forming star have been found 
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1242.77 1250.29 <NA> now significant organic molecules molecules not just like methane

JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1270.89 1278.95 <NA> start off with some of these basic building blocks now does that mean there 's going to be life all around maybe
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1279.81 1291.61 <NA> <unk> but it 's a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings those seeds all the way to life and most of those seeds will fall on fallow
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1291.6 1300.08 <NA> planets ca so for you personally finding an answer to this question of where we came from of how did this thing happen that
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1300 1304.58 <NA> something you would love to see js would love to see and like to know
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1304.72 1312.17 <NA> if that path is tortuous enough <unk> and so improbable that no matter what you start with
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1312.25 1320.88 <NA> we could be a singularity but on the other hand given all this organic dust that 's floating around <unk> we could have

JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1357.45 1360.97 <NA> works js well math certainly works
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1360.81 1366.58 <NA> math certainly works <unk> but this has been fun working with marilyn and
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1366.72 1368.68 <NA> giving it away has been
JimSimons_2015 1 JimSimons_2015 1368.68 1379.28 <NA> very enjoyable ca i just find it it 's an inspirational thought to me that by taking knowledge seriously so much more can come from it so thank you for your amazing life and for coming here to ted
