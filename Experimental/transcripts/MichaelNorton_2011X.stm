MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 29.93 32.43 <NA> <unk> fact that 's wrong 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 33.65 46.26 <NA> i 'm at a business school so that 's what we do so that that 's wrong <unk> and in fact <unk> if you think that you 're just not spending it right <unk> so instead of spending it the way you usually spend it maybe if you spent it differently that might work a little bit
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 45.89 49.99 <NA> better before i tell you the ways you can spend it that will make you happier <unk>
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 50.07 57.76 <NA> <unk> let 's think about the ways we usually spend it that don 't in fact make us happier <unk> we had a little natural experiment so cnn a little while ago wrote this
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 57.45 66.85 <NA> interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery <unk> it turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives will be amazing this article 's about how their lives get ruined
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 66.51 74.92 <NA> what happens when people win the lottery is one they spend all the money and go into debt and two all of their friends and everyone they 've ever met
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 74.46 79.94 <NA> find them and bug them for money it ruins their social relationships in fact so they have more debt
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 79.96 87.89 <NA> <unk> and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery what was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article readers of the thing 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 87.89 95.12 <NA> and instead of talking about how it it made them realize that money doesn 't lead to happiness <unk> everyone started saying you know what i 'd do if i won the lottery 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 94.78 100.02 <NA> and fantasizing about what they 'd do here 's just two of the ones we saw that are interesting to think

MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 106.88 114.21 <NA> and another person wrote i would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 114.17 122.62 <NA> this is even worse then i 'd have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 122.46 123.69 <NA> and nothing else 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 125.9 129.97 <NA> and so many of the comments were exactly of this type where people got money
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 129.96 139.35 <NA> <unk> and in fact it made them antisocial <unk> so i told you it ruins people 's lives and their friends bug them also money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves <unk>
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 139.36 150.14 <NA> we thought maybe the reason money doesn 't make us happy is that we 're spending it on the wrong things in particular we 're always spending it on ourselves <unk> and we wondered what would happen if we made people spend more of their money
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 149.97 153.53 <NA> on others so instead of being antisocial with your money <unk> what if you
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 154.98 166.34 <NA> it we thought let 's make people do it and see what happens let 's have some people do what they usually do spend money on themselves and let 's make some people give money away and measure their happiness and see if in fact they get happier <unk>
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 166.34 170.88 <NA> the first way we did this was one vancouver morning we went out on the campus
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 170.69 175.05 <NA> at university of british columbia approached people and said do you want to be in an experiment they said
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 175.94 184.68 <NA> <unk> we asked them how happy they were <unk> and then gave them an envelope one of the envelopes had things in it that said by 5pm today spend this money on
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 184.22 192.9 <NA> yourself we gave some examples of what you could spend it on other people got a slip of paper that said by 5pm today spend this money on somebody else 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 192.67 199.88 <NA> also inside the envelope was money and we manipulated how much money we gave them some people got this slip of paper and five dollars 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 199.88 202.87 <NA> some got this slip of paper and twenty dollars <unk> 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 202.68 204.22 <NA> we let them go about their day
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 204.9 212.89 <NA> <unk> whatever they wanted we found out they did spend it in the way we asked them to we called them up and asked them what did you spend it on how happy do you feel now 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 212.58 221.38 <NA> what did they spend it on these are college undergrads a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup one woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 220.95 224.81 <NA> people gave money to homeless people huge effect here of
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 228.16 234.17 <NA> <unk> if you give undergraduates five dollars it looks like coffee to them and they run over to starbucks and spend it as fast as they can
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 234.16 244.26 <NA> some people bought coffee for themselves the way they usually would but <unk> others bought coffee for somebody else so the very same purchase just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 244.21 249.99 <NA> <unk> somebody else <unk> what did we find when we called at the end of the day people who spent money on others got happier people who spent
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 251.51 261.61 <NA> <unk> didn 't make them less happy it just didn 't do much for them the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn 't matter much people thought twenty dollars would be way better than five in fact <unk> 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 261.56 270.24 <NA> <unk> it doesn 't matter how much money you spent what really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself we see this again and again when we give people money
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 279.9 285.7 <NA> <unk> we wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries so we went to uganda
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 285.5 298.03 <NA> and ran a very similar experiment imagine instead of just people in canada we say name the last time you spent money on yourself or others describe it how happy did it make you or in uganda name the last time you spent money on yourself or others
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 297.54 300.05 <NA> and describe that then we asked them how happy they
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 301.09 311.57 <NA> <unk> and what we see is sort of amazing because there 's human universals on what you do with your money and real cultural differences on what you do as well so for example <unk> one guy from uganda says this <unk>
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 311.52 318.84 <NA> i called a girl i wished to love they basically went out on a date and he says at the end that he didn 't achieve her up till now 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 325.7 331.71 <NA> <unk> we went to a movie we left early <unk> and then went back to her room for cake just cake 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 332.33 343.25 <NA> human universal you spend money on others you 're being nice <unk> maybe you have something in mind maybe not but then we see extraordinary differences so look at these two this is a woman from canada <unk> we say 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 343.25 345.96 <NA> name a time you spent money on somebody else she says 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 345.71 354.88 <NA> i bought a present for my mom i drove to the mall bought a present gave it to my mom perfectly nice thing to do it 's good to get gifts for people you know compare that to this woman from
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 354.87 361.99 <NA> <unk> uganda i was walking and met a longtime friend whose whose son was sick with malaria they had no money they went to a clinic
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 361.62 367.79 <NA> and i gave her this money this isn 't $ ten thousand it 's the local currency <unk> so it 's a very small amount of money in fact but
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 367.61 375.92 <NA> enormously different motivations here this is a real medical need literally a lifesaving donation <unk> above it 's just kind of i bought a gift for my mother 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 375.92 379.97 <NA> what we see again though is that the specific way you spend on other people
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 380.04 390.41 <NA> isn 't nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy which is really quite important so you don 't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy <unk>
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 390.36 399.96 <NA> you can do small trivial things and still get the benefits from doing this these are only two countries we wanted to look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 401.63 411.7 <NA> <unk> we got data from the gallup organization which you know from all the political polls happening lately they asked people did you donate money to charity recently and how happy are you with life in general 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 411.7 421.95 <NA> we can see what the relationship is between those two things are they positively correlated giving money makes you happy or are they negatively correlated on this map green will mean they 're positively correlated red means <unk>
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 421.9 429.97 <NA> they 're negatively correlated and you can see the world is crazily green so in almost every country in the world where we have this data people who give
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 429.96 436.48 <NA> <unk> money to charity are happier people than people who don 't give money to charity i know you 're looking at the red country in the middle 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 436.11 446.54 <NA> i would be a jerk and not tell you what it is but <unk> it 's central african republic you can make up stories maybe it 's different there for some reason just below that to the right is rwanda though which is amazingly green 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 446.54 450.08 <NA> so almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 450.04 451.25 <NA> <unk> than keeping it
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 450.82 452.63 <NA> for yourself <unk> 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 452.14 461.7 <NA> what about work which is where we spend the rest of our time when we 're not with the people we know <unk> we decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing these are sales teams
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 461.48 469.4 <NA> in belgium they work in teams go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs we can look and see how well they sell things

MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 471.53 479.97 <NA> we give people on some teams some money spend it however you want on yourself just like we did with the undergrads in canada <unk> to other teams we say here 's fifteen euro
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 480.19 490.38 <NA> spend it on one of your teammates buy them something as a gift and give it to them then we can see we 've got teams that spend on themselves and these pro social teams who we give money to <unk>
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 490.33 504.91 <NA> make the team better the reason i have a ridiculous pinata there is one team pooled their money and bought a pinata <unk> they smashed the pinata the candy fell out and things like that a silly trivial thing to do but think of the difference on a team that didn 't do that at all that got fifteen euro
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 504.99 515.14 <NA> <unk> it in their pocket maybe bought themselves a coffee or teams that had this pro social experience where they bonded together to buy something and do a group activity what we see is that the teams that are pro social sell <unk>
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 515.04 528.92 <NA> <unk> more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves one way to think of it is for every fifteen euro you give people for themselves <unk> they put it in their pocket and don 't do anything different than before you don 't get money from that you lose money since it doesn 't motivate them to perform
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 530.02 536.64 <NA> <unk> when you give them fifteen euro to spend on their teammates they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 536.43 542.72 <NA> you 're probably thinking to yourselves this is all fine but there 's a context that 's incredibly important for public policy

MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 554.96 560.25 <NA> <unk> got that if you can 't show it with dodgeball teams this is all stupid so we we went and
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 559.91 571.36 <NA> found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them and did the exact same thing as before so we give people on some teams money to spend on themselves other teams we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates <unk> 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 571.36 578.95 <NA> the teams that spend money on themselves have the same winning percentages as before the teams we give the money to spend on each other become different teams

MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 600.01 605.43 <NA> <unk> that 's the way to make yourself happier it 's that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself 
MichaelNorton_2011X 1 MichaelNorton_2011X 605.19 610.84 <NA> and try giving some of it to other people instead and we luckily have an opportunity for you
