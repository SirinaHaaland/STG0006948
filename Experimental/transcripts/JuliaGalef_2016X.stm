JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 176.68 179.97 <NA> next <unk> they went and looked through his personal history for

JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 201.24 208.3 <NA> <unk> a spy has to remember a lot of things so the case went to trial <unk> and dreyfus was found guilty
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 208.62 212.18 <NA> afterwards they took him out into this public square

JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 244.32 253.43 <NA> one thing that 's really interesting to me about the dreyfus affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that dreyfus was guilty i
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 253 254.85 <NA> mean you might even assume that
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 254.84 257.94 <NA> <unk> that they were setting him up that they were intentionally framing him
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 257.94 267.3 <NA> but historians don 't think that 's what happened as far as we can tell the officers genuinely believed that the case against dreyfus was strong which
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 266.81 274.96 <NA> makes you wonder <unk> what does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man <unk>
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 277.11 288.08 <NA> <unk> this is a case of what scientists call motivated reasoning it 's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations our desires and fears <unk> shape the way we interpret information

JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 304.93 310.64 <NA> <unk> you have never persecuted a french jewish officer for high treason i assume
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 310.21 316.67 <NA> <unk> but maybe you 've followed sports or politics so you might have noticed that
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 316.57 325.11 <NA> when the referee judges that your team committed a foul for example you 're highly motivated to find reasons why he 's wrong <unk> but if he judges
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 325.04 329.58 <NA> <unk> that the other team committed a foul awesome that 's a good call let 's not examine it too closely 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 330.26 337.35 <NA> or maybe you 've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy like capital punishment 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 337.22 344.28 <NA> and as researchers have demonstrated if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it 's not effective
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 344 349.4 <NA> <unk> then you 're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed <unk> 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 349.4 354.97 <NA> but if it shows that capital punishment works it 's a good study and vice versa if you don 't support capital punishment same thing
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 355.38 363.8 <NA> our judgment is strongly influenced <unk> unconsciously <unk> by which side we want to win and this is ubiquitous this shapes

JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 371.52 379.58 <NA> what 's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset is how unconscious it is we can think we 're being objective and
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 380.07 384.26 <NA> fair minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man <unk> 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 384.49 387.66 <NA> however fortunately for dreyfus his story is not over 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 387.42 394.62 <NA> this is colonel picquart he 's another high ranking officer in the french army <unk> and like most people he assumed dreyfus was guilty 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 394.62 399.17 <NA> also like most people in the army he was at least casually anti semitic 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 398.8 399.93 <NA> but
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 403.79 413.4 <NA> <unk> what if we 're all wrong about dreyfus what happened was he had discovered evidence that the spying for germany had continued <unk> even after dreyfus was in prison 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 413.03 421.92 <NA> and he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo much closer than dreyfus 's handwriting 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 421.88 424.9 <NA> so he brought these discoveries to his superiors
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 426.36 434.03 <NA> <unk> to his dismay <unk> they either didn 't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings like 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 434.03 445.12 <NA> well <unk> all you 've really shown picquart is that there 's another spy who learned how to mimic dreyfus 's handwriting and he picked up the torch of spying after dreyfus left <unk> 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 444.78 446.89 <NA> but dreyfus is still guilty 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 447.36 449.93 <NA> eventually picquart managed to get dreyfus
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 450.82 457.05 <NA> <unk> but it took him ten years <unk> and for part of that time he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army <unk>
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 459.96 464.39 <NA> a lot of people feel like picquart can 't really be the hero of this story
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 464.19 473.84 <NA> because he was an anti semite and that 's bad <unk> which i agree with <unk> but personally for me the fact that picquart was anti semitic
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 473.53 475.2 <NA> actually makes his actions
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 476.51 484.57 <NA> <unk> because he had the same prejudices the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 484.36 486.66 <NA> trumped all of that
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 486.56 492.45 <NA> <unk> so to me <unk> picquart is a poster child for what i call scout mindset 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 492.08 502.33 <NA> it 's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose <unk> but just to see what 's really there as as honestly and accurately as you can even if it 's not

JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 521.58 526.19 <NA> <unk> and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 529.81 535.61 <NA> <unk> emotional so just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like

JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 538.06 541.82 <NA> scout mindset is too it 's just rooted in different emotions
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 541.82 549.84 <NA> for example <unk> scouts are curious <unk> they 're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new

JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 562.82 570.75 <NA> they think it 's virtuous to test your own beliefs <unk> and they 're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak 
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 570.29 574.93 <NA> and above all scouts are grounded which means
JuliaGalef_2016X 1 JuliaGalef_2016X 575.79 577.85 <NA> <unk> as a person isn 't tied
