CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 20.68 28.38 <NA> and as a little girl i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful trusted sidekick
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 28.2 29.88 <NA> something that would delight us
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 29.92 33.57 <NA> enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two <unk>
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 33.56 39.06 <NA> i knew robots like that didn 't really exist <unk> but i knew i wanted to build them 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 38.9 45.39 <NA> so twenty years pass i am now a graduate student at mit studying artificial intelligence <unk> the year is <unk>
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 46.51 54.64 <NA> and nasa has just landed the first robot on mars <unk> but robots are still not in our home ironically <unk> and i remember thinking about
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 54.81 63.88 <NA> <unk> all the reasons why that was the case <unk> but one really struck me <unk> robotics had really been about interacting with things not with people
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 63.48 67.69 <NA> certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 67.32 75.08 <NA> people accept robots into our daily lives for me that was the white space that 's what robots could not do yet <unk> and so that year i started
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 76.87 79.25 <NA> <unk> world 's first social robot
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 79.3 87.39 <NA> three years later a lot of programming working with other graduate students in the lab kismet was ready to start interacting with people
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 105.95 112.74 <NA> <unk> child or pre verbal child which i assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind it didn 't speak language but it didn 't matter 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 112.74 117.31 <NA> this little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 117.15 124.87 <NA> and with that the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots <unk> so over the past several years i 've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 125.22 131.56 <NA> <unk> now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students and one of my favorite robots
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 131.16 138.29 <NA> is leonardo we developed leonardo in collaboration with stan winston studio and so i want to show you a special moment for me of leo <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 138.29 145.94 <NA> this is matt berlin interacting with leo introducing leo to a new object and because it 's new leo doesn 't really know what to make of it 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 145.71 149.51 <NA> but sort of like us he can actually learn about it from watching matt 's reaction
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 155.95 157.67 <NA> <unk> this is cookie monster 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 160.99 163.34 <NA> can you find cookie monster <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 169.27 172.46 <NA> leo cookie monster is very bad <unk>

CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 191.78 198.18 <NA> right so leo and cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start but they get along great now 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 199.34 204.97 <NA> so what i 've learned through building these systems is that robots are
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 204.93 212.96 <NA> <unk> actually a really intriguing social technology <unk> where it 's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 212.72 223.63 <NA> that is a core part of their functionality and with that shift in thinking we can now start to imagine new questions new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 223.86 225.08 <NA> but what do i mean
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 225 228.32 <NA> when i say push our social buttons well one of the things that we 've learned is that
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 228.32 237.23 <NA> if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language the same sort of non verbal cues that people use like nexi our humanoid robot is doing here
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 236.74 241.29 <NA> what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 241.29 248.09 <NA> people use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is how likable how engaging how trustworthy it
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 247.63 250.34 <NA> turns out it 's the same for robots 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 249.97 254.88 <NA> it 's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 254.84 256.42 <NA> <unk> understand human behavior 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 256.18 262.9 <NA> to answer questions like how is it that from a brief encounter we 're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 262.66 268.79 <NA> mimicry 's believed to play a role <unk> but how is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 268.79 274.9 <NA> it turns out it 's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 276.57 281.99 <NA> <unk> we can 't carefully control them because they 're subconscious for us but with the robot you can and so in this video here
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 281.75 290.81 <NA> this is a video taken from david desteno 's lab at northeastern university he 's a psychologist we 've been collaborating with there 's actually a scientist carefully controlling nexi 's cues
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 290.81 299.89 <NA> to be able to study this question <unk> and the bottom line is the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 301.18 308.12 <NA> <unk> given that key insight <unk> we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots for instance <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 307.87 312.66 <NA> if robots do respond to our non verbal cues maybe they would be a cool new
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 312.5 321.17 <NA> communication technology <unk> so imagine this what about a robot accessory for your cellphone you call your friend <unk> she puts her handset in a robot and <unk>
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 322.32 329.94 <NA> you can make eye contact you can talk with your friends you can move around you can gesture maybe the next best thing to really being there or is it
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 330.17 340.47 <NA> to explore this question my student siggy adalgeirsson did a study where we brought human participants people into our lab to do a collaborative task <unk>
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 340.37 354.7 <NA> <unk> with a remote collaborator the task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task this ended up being a survival task and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 354.78 362.42 <NA> the remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants <unk>
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 362.42 367.07 <NA> the first was just the screen this is just like video conferencing today <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 366.83 374.96 <NA> the next was to add mobility so have the screen on a mobile base this is like if you 're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today this is mirroring that that
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 376.39 378.59 <NA> <unk> and then the fully expressive mebot 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 378.37 386.67 <NA> so after the interaction we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with with the technology with a remote collaborator through this technology <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 386.49 388.26 <NA> in a number of different ways <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 388.08 393.97 <NA> we looked at psychological involvement how much empathy did you feel for the other person we looked at overall engagement <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 393.97 404.48 <NA> we looked at their desire to cooperate and this is what we see when they use just the screen <unk> it turns out when you add mobility the ability to roll around the table you get a little more of a boost 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 404.87 411.06 <NA> <unk> more of a boost when you add the full expression so it seems like this physical social embodiment actually really makes a difference 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 411.11 414.57 <NA> now let 's try to put this into a little bit of context 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 414.35 421.56 <NA> today we know that families are living further and further apart and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 421.07 425.17 <NA> for me i have three young boys <unk> and i want them to have a really good relationship
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 427.17 436.76 <NA> <unk> but my parents live thousands of miles away so they just don 't get to see each other that often <unk> we try skype we try phone calls but my boys are little they don 't really want to talk they want to play <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 436.76 444.92 <NA> so i love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance play technology <unk> i imagine a time not too far from now
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 444.68 450.08 <NA> my mom can go to her computer open up a browser and jack into a little robot <unk> and as

CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 458.97 467.94 <NA> i could imagine grandmothers being able to do social plays with their granddaughters with their friends <unk> and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house like sharing a bedtime story <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 467.7 475.14 <NA> and through this technology being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren 's lives in a way that 's not possible today
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 475.7 478.68 <NA> <unk> think about some other domains like maybe health 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 478.68 486.81 <NA> so in the united states today over sixty five percent of people are either overweight or obese and now it 's a big problem with our children as well 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 486.5 496.17 <NA> and we know that as you get older in life if you 're obese when you 're younger that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life <unk> but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 495.95 499.93 <NA> but if robots can be engaging if we like to cooperate
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 500.67 508.63 <NA> <unk> if robots are persuasive maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program maybe they can help you manage your weight
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 508.68 521.02 <NA> sort of like a digital jiminy as in the well known fairy tale a kind of friendly supportive presence that 's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 520.56 523.84 <NA> so we actually explored this idea in our lab 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 523.62 524.99 <NA> this is a robot <unk>
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 525.61 531.53 <NA> <unk> cory kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work <unk> and it was designed to be a robot diet and exercise coach 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 531.13 541.43 <NA> it had a couple of simple non verbal skills it could do it could make eye contact with you it could share information looking down at a screen you 'd use a screen interface to enter information like how many calories you ate that day <unk>
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 541.38 553.17 <NA> how much exercise you got and then it could help track that for you and the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and and patients and so forth <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 555.16 561.57 <NA> working alliance with you through that dialogue <unk> it could help you set goals and track your progress and it would help motivate you 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 561.14 569.97 <NA> so an interesting question is does the social embodiment really matter does it matter that it 's a robot is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 570.08 579.97 <NA> to explore that question we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interventions in people 's homes for a period of several weeks one case was the robot you saw
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 580.81 594.67 <NA> another was a computer that ran the same touch screen interface <unk> ran exactly the same dialogues the quality of advice was identical <unk> and the third was just a pen and paper log because that 's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet and exercise program <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 594.42 600.02 <NA> so one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 600.79 607.4 <NA> <unk> but really how long they interacted with the robot because the challenge is not losing weight it 's actually keeping it off and
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 607.39 613.29 <NA> the longer you could interact with one of these interventions <unk> well that 's indicative potentially of longer term success <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 613.07 617.57 <NA> so the first thing i want to look at is how long how long did people interact with these systems <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 617.29 624.56 <NA> it turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 625.19 630.54 <NA> <unk> when it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance people rated the robot higher
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 630.32 632.52 <NA> and they trusted the robot more 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 633.41 638.1 <NA> and when you look at emotional engagement <unk> it was completely different 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 638.12 642.63 <NA> people would name the robots they would dress the robots 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 643.64 649.8 <NA> laughter and even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study they would come out to the car and say good bye to the robots 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 649.67 654.97 <NA> they didn 't do this with a computer <unk> the last thing i want to talk about today is the future of children 's media
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 655.35 664.24 <NA> we know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today whether it 's television or computer games or whatnot my sons they love the screen they love the screen <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 663.9 668.98 <NA> but i want them to play as a mom i want them to play like real world play <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 668.98 675.11 <NA> and so i have a new project in my group i wanted to present to you today called playtime computing that 's really trying to think about
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 675.49 686.18 <NA> <unk> take what 's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child where it can take on many of the properties of real world play <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 685.69 687.68 <NA> so here 's the
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 687.82 689.81 <NA> first exploration of this idea <unk>
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 691 699.99 <NA> <unk> characters can be physical or virtual <unk> and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back <unk> i
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 712.13 717.11 <NA> <unk> the character itself could come into your world it turns out that kids
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 717.11 729.97 <NA> love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world and when it 's in their world they can relate to it and play with it in a way that 's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen another important idea is this notion of persistence of character
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 729.93 731.68 <NA> <unk> across realities <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 731.22 741.83 <NA> so changes that that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world so here <unk> nathan has changed the letter a to the number two you can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 741.62 750.29 <NA> when it goes into the virtual world so they are now sending the character back into that world and now it 's got number power <unk> and then finally
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 750.31 764.75 <NA> <unk> what i 've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids where they really feel like they are part of that story a part of that experience and i really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching star wars 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 764.55 774.81 <NA> but i want to do more than that i actually want them to create those experiences i want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own <unk> so we 've been exploring
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 774.76 779.91 <NA> <unk> a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into

CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 782.98 792.57 <NA> and build upon them i really want to come up with new ways of children 's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation i think that 's very very important 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 792.32 800.46 <NA> so this is a new project we 've invited a lot of kids into this space and they think it 's pretty cool <unk> 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 799.97 803.14 <NA> but i can tell you the thing that they love the most
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 802.97 804.97 <NA> is the robot <unk> what they care
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 804.93 806.86 <NA> <unk> about is the robot 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 806.4 814.31 <NA> robots touch something deeply human within us and so whether they 're helping us to become creative and innovative 
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 1 CynthiaBreazeal_2010W 814.1 824.53 <NA> or whether they 're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance or whether they are our trusted sidekick who 's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves
