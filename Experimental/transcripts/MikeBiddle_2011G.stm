MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 20.41 29.97 <NA> i hope within the next ten minutes to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life and i 'd like to start at the very beginning think back when you
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 29.93 39.72 <NA> <unk> were just a kid how did look at the stuff in your life <unk> perhaps it was like these toddler rules it 's my stuff if i saw it first 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 39.98 44.16 <NA> the entire pile is my stuff if i 'm building something 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 43.97 50.14 <NA> the more stuff that 's mine the better <unk> and of course <unk> it 's your stuff if it 's broken
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 52.02 62.19 <NA> <unk> well after spending about twenty years in the recycling industry it 's become pretty clear to me that we don 't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults <unk> and let me tell you why i have that perspective 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 62.2 73.88 <NA> because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people 's discarded stuff now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 73.7 79.91 <NA> but it 's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world well less than one percent
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 79.93 91.79 <NA> <unk> in fact the united nations estimates that there 's about eighty five billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year and that 's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream <unk> 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 91.36 100.1 <NA> and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth that number well more than doubles <unk> and of course the more developed the country the bigger these mountains <unk> 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 99.64 104 <NA> now when you see these mountains <unk> most people think of garbage 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 103.84 104.94 <NA> we see
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 104.98 112.19 <NA> above ground mines and the reason we see mines is because there 's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 112.03 122.46 <NA> and it 's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams <unk> because as we 've heard all week at ted <unk>
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 122.41 129.88 <NA> the world 's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff and of course <unk> they want the toys
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 130.02 140.17 <NA> <unk> the tools that many of us take for granted <unk> and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day <unk> it 's mostly many types of plastics and many types <unk>
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 140.07 149.63 <NA> <unk> of metals and the metals we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world and the

MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 152.01 157.65 <NA> which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 157.65 164.87 <NA> and these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we 're already starting to see today 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 165.01 173.88 <NA> the good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end of life stuff and starting to recycle our end of life stuff <unk> particularly in regions of the world like here in europe
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 173.69 179.46 <NA> that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 180.17 185.59 <NA> <unk> most of what 's extracted from our <unk> end of life stuff if it makes it to a recycler are the metals 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 185.59 190.78 <NA> to put that in perspective and i 'm using steel as a proxy here for metals because it 's the most common metal
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 190.57 200.02 <NA> if your stuff makes it to a recycler <unk> probably over ninety percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose plastics are a whole other story
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 200 210.02 <NA> well less than ten percent are are recovered in fact it 's more like five percent most of it 's incinerated or landfilled now most people think that 's because plastics are a throw away material have very little value
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 210.02 219.23 <NA> <unk> but actually plastics are several times more valuable than steel <unk> and there 's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel <unk> 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 227.05 232.01 <NA> <unk> 's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 232.01 245.36 <NA> they have very different densities they have different electrical and magnetic properties <unk> and they even have different colors <unk> so it 's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 245.2 254.94 <NA> plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties <unk> and any plastic can be
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 254.87 262.56 <NA> <unk> any color as you probably well know so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don 't work for plastics <unk> 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 263 275.73 <NA> another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world and sadly to say <unk> particularly from the united states where we don 't have any recycling policies in place like here in europe
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 275.27 277.9 <NA> finds its way to developing countries for

MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 291.99 299.42 <NA> or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here <unk> and they extract the metals by hand <unk>
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 309.76 316.55 <NA> <unk> i call this environmental arbitrage <unk> and it 's not fair it 's not safe and it 's not sustainable 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 318.13 324.99 <NA> now because the plastics are so plentiful and by the way those other methods don 't lead to the recovery of plastics obviously
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 325 333.03 <NA> but people do try to recover the plastics <unk> this is just one example this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai india 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 332.6 344.82 <NA> they store the plastics on the roofs they bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these and people try very hard to separate the plastics by color by shape by feel by any technique they can 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 344.51 352.56 <NA> and sometimes they 'll resort to what 's known as the burn and sniff technique where they 'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic <unk> 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 352.49 354.94 <NA> none of these techniques result in any
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 354.96 361.09 <NA> <unk> amount of recycling in any significant way <unk> and by the way <unk> please don 't try this technique at home <unk>

MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 373.92 379.88 <NA> so about twenty years ago i literally started in my garage tinkering around trying to figure out how to separate these very

MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 393.07 400.02 <NA> and we eventually broke the code this is the last frontier of recycling it 's the last major material to be recovered in any
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 400 407.78 <NA> significant amount on the earth and we finally figured out how to do it and in the process we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 407.56 417.58 <NA> the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals you breakdown the molecules you recombine them in very specific ways to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day <unk> 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 417.53 423.19 <NA> <unk> we said there 's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint

MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 434.31 444.89 <NA> and because we 're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them <unk> we 're using a mining approach to extract the materials we have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment <unk> 
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 444.89 454.37 <NA> we have enormous energy savings i don 't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save eighty to ninety percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way <unk>

MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 476.6 488.58 <NA> <unk> the short time period i have i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits they recover the metals and leave behind what 's called shredder residue it 's their waste a
MikeBiddle_2011G 1 MikeBiddle_2011G 488.58 492.19 <NA> very complex mixture of materials but predominantly plastics <unk>
