RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 193.55 199.96 <NA> it 's better <unk> you know they like it <unk> so <unk> how is it that people went from the twelve thousand miles a year to
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 200 208.33 <NA> five hundred miles it 's because they said it 's eight to ten dollars an hour and sixty five dollars a day if i 'm going to go buy some ice cream 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 208.5 217.93 <NA> do i really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream or maybe i 'll do without maybe i would have bought the ice cream when i did some other errand so people really respond very quickly to it to <unk>
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 217.83 223.4 <NA> <unk> prices and the last point i want to make is zipcar would never be possible without technology

RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 230.71 239.17 <NA> and for me as a service provider i would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything so without these wireless technologies

RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 241.81 247.43 <NA> so here 's another example this company is goloco i 'm launching it in about three weeks
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 247 254.01 <NA> and i hope to do for ridesharing what i did for car sharing this will apply to people across all of america today
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 254.99 264.33 <NA> <unk> of the trips are single occupancy vehicles yet twelve percent of trips to work are currently carpool <unk> and i think that we can apply social networks

RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 294.62 303.65 <NA> and it will also i think enhance our freedom of mobility <unk> where can i go today and who can i do it with those are the types of things that you will look at and feel 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 303.65 304.97 <NA> and the social benefits
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 305.74 315.21 <NA> the rate of single occupancy vehicles is i told you seventy five percent i think we can get that that down to fifty percent the demand for parking of course is down congestion and the co2 emissions 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 315.21 317.61 <NA> one last piece about this of course is that it 's
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 317.4 325.23 <NA> enabled by wireless technologies and it 's the cost of driving that 's making people want to be able to do this the average american spends
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 325.01 329.88 <NA> nineteen percent of their income on their car and there 's a pressure for them to

RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 333.05 344.82 <NA> so <unk> the last example of this is congestion pricing very famously done in london it 's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads in london the day they turned the congestion pricing on 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 344.36 354.25 <NA> there was a twenty five percent decrease in congestion overnight <unk> and that 's persisted for the four years in which they 've been doing congestion pricing and again do people like the outcome

RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 359.7 365.95 <NA> again we can see that price plays an enormous role in people 's willingness to

RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 375.85 377.33 <NA> <unk> we can undo that 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 377.08 386.84 <NA> congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is again wirelessly enabled you weren 't going to put tollbooths around the city of london and open and shut those gates <unk> 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 386.92 394.16 <NA> and what congestion pricing is is that it 's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 393.94 399.99 <NA> and road pricing is where we 're all going to have to go because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 400.49 403.08 <NA> <unk> with gas taxes and
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 403.97 412.92 <NA> as we get our cars more fuel efficient that 's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes so we need to charge people by the
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 412.58 417.51 <NA> by the mile that they drive whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 417.5 425.04 <NA> will be happening with road pricing why do we travel too much car travel is underpriced and therefore we over consumed 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 425 431.17 <NA> we need to put this better market feedback <unk> and if we have it you 'll decide how many miles to drive what mode of travel where to live and work 
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 431.16 437.71 <NA> and wireless technologies make this real time loop possible so i want to move now to the second part of my story <unk>

RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 439.2 441.74 <NA> when are we going to start doing
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 441.55 451.34 <NA> this this congestion pricing road pricing is coming when are we going to do it are we going to wait ten to fifteen years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years
RobinChase_2007 1 RobinChase_2007 455.01 461.75 <NA> overnight <unk> and what kind of wireless technology are we going to use <unk> this is my
