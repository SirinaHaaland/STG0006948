LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 66.02 71.86 <NA> various diseases thrive in this environment the most drastic of which is called trachoma 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 71.46 79.97 <NA> trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye <unk> multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind

LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 115.28 124.26 <NA> i did research on wikipedia on google about lotions creams the compositions the melting points the toxicities i did high school science
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 123.86 129.97 <NA> and i wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper and it looked like the kfc special spice
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 130.1 139.06 <NA> you know so i was like okay <unk> so we 've got the formula ready now we need to get this thing into practice <unk> fast forward four years later <unk>

LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 154.63 157.35 <NA> <unk> drybath the world 's first
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 158.82 164.09 <NA> lotion you literally put it on your skin and you don 't have to bathe 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 168.07 171.71 <NA> so after having tried to make it work in high school
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 171.71 179.94 <NA> with the limited resources i had i went to university met a few people got it into practice <unk> and we have a fully functioning
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 179.9 188.13 <NA> <unk> product that 's ready to go to the market it 's actually available on the market <unk> so we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making drybath available 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 188.15 193.29 <NA> one of the things we learned was that poor communities don 't buy products in bulk 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 192.8 200.14 <NA> they buy products on demand a person in alex doesn 't buy a box of cigarettes they buy one cigarette each day even though it 's more expensive
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 200.58 206.07 <NA> <unk> so we packaged drybath in these innovative little sachets you just snap them in half <unk> and you squeeze it out 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 206.08 211.78 <NA> and the cool part is one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 211.8 220.3 <NA> after creating that model we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 220.62 229.94 <NA> at least once a week <unk> anyway we realized that we could save eighty million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath and also we would save
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 229.87 239.54 <NA> <unk> two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas two hours more for school two hours more for homework two hours more to just be a kid 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 239.38 246.84 <NA> after seeing that global impact we narrowed it down to our key value proposition which was cleanliness and convenience 
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 246.84 250.08 <NA> drybath is a rich man 's convenience and a poor man
LudwickMarishane_2012S 1 LudwickMarishane_2012S 250 250.78 <NA> 's lifesaver
