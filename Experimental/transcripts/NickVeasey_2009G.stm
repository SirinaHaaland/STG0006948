NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 18.49 29.55 <NA> quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch i 'm not sure it seems a bit extreme to me that image was the start of the x ray technology and i 'm still fundamentally using the same principles today
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 29.95 35.58 <NA> i 'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner <unk> the
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 35.6 43.3 <NA> first shot i ever did was of a soda can which was to promote a brand that we all know so i 'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 43.3 48 <NA> but the second shot i did was my shoes i was wearing on the day and i do really like this shot because
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 47.54 52.06 <NA> it shows all the detritus that 's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 54.99 59.68 <NA> <unk> time moving on to something a bit larger this is an x ray of
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 59.48 62.32 <NA> a bus and the bus is full of people it
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 61.89 71.06 <NA> 's actually the same person it 's just one skeleton <unk> and back in the ' 60s they used to teach student radiographers to take x rays thankfully not on you and i but
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 70.82 79.97 <NA> on dead people <unk> so i 've still got access to one of these dead people called frieda she 's falling apart i 'm afraid because she 's very old and fragile <unk> but everyone on
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 79.9 82.35 <NA> <unk> that bus is frieda and the bus is taken with a
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 83.64 86.87 <NA> which is the sort of machine you have on borders which
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 86.53 90.17 <NA> checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 90.16 92.33 <NA> fairly obvious what that is 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 92.26 102.02 <NA> so using large scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don 't see x rays of big things that often technology is moving ahead and
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 101.62 104.28 <NA> these large cargo scanner
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 104.87 107.49 <NA> <unk> that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better <unk> 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 107.49 115.29 <NA> again though to make it come alive you need somehow to add the human element <unk> and i think the reason this image works again is because frieda is driving the bulldozer 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 117.02 124.41 <NA> quite a difficult brief make a pair of men 's pants look beautiful but i think the process in itself <unk> shows how exquisite they are 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 124.37 129.01 <NA> fashion now i 'm sort of anti fashion because i don 't show the surface i show what 's within
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 130.14 136.21 <NA> <unk> don 't really like me because it doesn 't matter if kate moss is wearing it or if i 'm wearing it it looks the same 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 136.26 141.59 <NA> we all look the same inside believe me <unk> the creases in the material and the
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 141.14 143.02 <NA> sort of nuances and
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 143.02 153.92 <NA> i show things for really what they are what they 're made of i peel back the layers and expose it <unk> and if it 's well made i show it if it 's badly made i show it <unk> and i 'm sure ross can associate that with design the design comes from within
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 154.9 164.9 <NA> <unk> it 's not just topshop i get some strange looks when i go out getting my props here i was fumbling around in the ladies ' underwear department of a department store <unk> almost got escorted from the premises <unk> 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 164.83 179.07 <NA> i live opposite a farm and this was the runt of the litter a piglet that died and what 's really interesting is if you look at the legs you 'll notice that the bones haven 't fused and should that pig have grown unfortunately it was dead it would have certainly been dead after i x rayed it with the amount of radiation i used anyway
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 180.01 184.14 <NA> but once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 185.15 186.51 <NA> so that 's
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 186.38 191.92 <NA> an empty parka jacket but i quite love the way it 's posed nature is my greatest inspiration 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 191.92 199.78 <NA> and to carry on with a theme that we 've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture <unk> if you look at the roof of
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 199.57 204.97 <NA> the eden project or the british library it 's all this honeycomb structure <unk> and i 'm sure those architects are
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 204.96 212.95 <NA> <unk> inspired as i am by what surrounds us by nature this in fact is a victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 212.79 219.1 <NA> an amaryllis flower looking really three dimensional seaweed ebbing in the tide <unk> 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 219 222.95 <NA> now how do i do this and where do i do this and all of that sort of thing this is my new
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 229.93 232.05 <NA> <unk> one thousand two hundred and fifty kilograms and
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 231.81 235.7 <NA> the only exercise i get is opening and closing it 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 236.38 242.51 <NA> the walls are seven hundred millimeters thick of solid dense concrete so i 'm using quite a lot of radiation 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 242.08 249.96 <NA> a lot more than you 'd get in a hospital or a vet 's and there i am this is a quite high powered x ray machine what 's interesting really about
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 250.34 260.46 <NA> <unk> really is if you think about it is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs or looking for contraband or whatever and i use that sort of technology to create things that <unk>
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 260.41 265.92 <NA> are quite beautiful <unk> so <unk> still working with film i 'm afraid technology in <unk>
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 267.38 275.05 <NA> <unk> apart from these large cargo scanning machines hasn 't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it which is show
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 279.69 281.95 <NA> <unk> was designed in the days when everyone shot
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 281.55 285.28 <NA> photographs on film they scan each individual x ray 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 285.06 294.46 <NA> and this shows how i do my process of same size x rays so this is <unk> again my daughter 's dress still has the tag in it from me buying it so i can take it back to the shop if she didn 't like it <unk> 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 294 297.91 <NA> but there are four x ray plates you can see them overlapping <unk> 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 297.51 300.2 <NA> so <unk> when you move forward
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 300.58 307.31 <NA> <unk> something fairly small a dress which is this size onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process you can see that that is a lot of work 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 307.31 312.71 <NA> in fact that is three months solid x raying there is over five hundred separate components <unk> 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 312.22 316.67 <NA> boeing sent me a seven hundred and forty seven in containers <unk> and i sent them back an x ray 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 317.29 324.84 <NA> i kid you not okay so frieda is my dead skeleton this <unk> unfortunately is basically two pictures <unk> one on the
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 325.37 328.95 <NA> <unk> is a photograph of an american footballer the one on the left is an x ray 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 328.52 334.81 <NA> but this time i had to use a real body because i needed all the skin tissue to make it look real to make it look like it was a real athlete 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 334.81 339.81 <NA> so here i had to use a recently deceased body <unk> and getting a hold of that was
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 339.83 347.04 <NA> extremely difficult and laborious but people do donate their bodies to art and science and when they do i 'm in the queue so i like to use them 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 354.3 363.31 <NA> <unk> more organic more natural <unk> it 's whatever takes my fancy really <unk> it 's not accurately colored to how it is in real life that flower doesn 't come in bright orange i don 't think 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 362.82 365.2 <NA> but i just like it in bright orange 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 364.83 373.09 <NA> and also with something technical like these are dj decks it sort of adds another level it makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 373.02 375.08 <NA> <unk> the most difficult things to
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 375.07 383.63 <NA> <unk> the most technically challenging things to x ray are the lightest things <unk> the most delicate things to get the detail in a feather <unk> believe me if there is anyone out here who knows anything about x rays that 's
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 383.2 385.92 <NA> quite a challenge <unk> i 'm now going to show you
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 385.73 387.39 <NA> a short film i 'll step to the side
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 411.11 418 <NA> <unk> if you touch that you could possibly die through radiation poisoning in my career i 've had two exposures to radiation which is two too
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 431.91 436.43 <NA> <unk> a child 's toy that we all recognize <unk> but also it looks like it 's a robot
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 492.74 500.76 <NA> <unk> which is used on the borders between countries looking for contraband and illegal immigrants the lorry goes in front of it and it takes slices
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 500.63 503.71 <NA> of x rays through the lorry <unk> and that 's how this was done
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 505.07 511.81 <NA> bit like a ct scanner in a hospital slices and then if you look carefully there is all little things he 's got headphones on reading
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 511.38 517.21 <NA> the newspaper got a hat on glasses got a bag <unk> so these little details
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 517.53 520.75 <NA> help to make it work make it real 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 528.01 535.19 <NA> <unk> the problem with using living people is that to take an x ray if i x ray you you get exposed to radiation so to avoid that
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 534.73 536 <NA> i have to
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 535.83 539.48 <NA> avoid it somehow is i use dead people 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 539.11 548.97 <NA> now that 's a variety of things from recently deceased bodies to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train

NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 557.06 558.39 <NA> i have

NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 572.32 574.74 <NA> inside that stem <unk> because it transfers
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 575 578.33 <NA> food from its roots to its leaves look at this monster
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 604.87 608.69 <NA> <unk> be not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye <unk> 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 609.37 611.54 <NA> the way the leaves form 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 611.59 613.76 <NA> they 're curling back on each other 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 613.54 617 <NA> so the x ray will show the overlaps in these little corners
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 627.92 636.18 <NA> <unk> the thicker the object <unk> the more radiation it needs <unk> and the more time it needs the lighter the object <unk> the less radiation sometimes you keep the time up 
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 635.9 641.02 <NA> because the time gives you detail the longer the exposure goes on for the more detail you get
NickVeasey_2009G 1 NickVeasey_2009G 661.2 669.62 <NA> <unk> get a bit darker in the tube <unk> but everything else would suffer so these leaves at the edge would start to disappear what i like is how hard the
