ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 12.64 15.5 <NA> <unk> so why do we learn mathematics
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 15.25 21.53 <NA> essentially for three reasons calculation application <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 21.16 28.07 <NA> and last and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it inspiration 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 27.97 29.94 <NA> mathematics is the science
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 29.9 36.54 <NA> <unk> of patterns and we study it to learn how to think logically critically and creatively <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 36.17 41.74 <NA> but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 41.74 50.41 <NA> and when our students ask why are we learning this then they often hear that they 'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 50.17 54.91 <NA> but wouldn 't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 54.87 59.83 <NA> <unk> because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 59.43 70.15 <NA> now i know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers the fibonacci numbers 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 69.93 79.97 <NA> yeah i already have fibonacci fans here that 's great now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways <unk> from the standpoint of calculation
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 80.49 84.56 <NA> they 're as easy to understand as one plus one which is two 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 84.33 91.19 <NA> then one plus two is three <unk> two plus three is five three plus five is eight <unk> and so on <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 90.96 103.99 <NA> indeed the person we call fibonacci was actually named leonardo of pisa and these numbers appear in his book liber abaci which taught the western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 104.72 115.2 <NA> <unk> applications fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often the number of petals on a flower is typically a fibonacci number or the number of spirals <unk>
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 115.15 120.13 <NA> on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a fibonacci number as well 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 125.25 135.31 <NA> <unk> about them are the beautiful number patterns they display let me show you one of my favorites <unk> suppose you like to square numbers <unk> and frankly who doesn 't
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 135.75 147.88 <NA> let 's look at the squares of the first few fibonacci numbers so one squared is one two squared is four three squared is nine five squared is twenty five and so on
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 147.51 150.02 <NA> now it 's no surprise that when you
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 150.04 160.43 <NA> <unk> add consecutive fibonacci numbers you get the next fibonacci number right that 's how they 're created <unk> but you wouldn 't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together <unk>
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 160.38 166.71 <NA> <unk> but check this out one plus one gives us two <unk> and one plus four gives us five 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 180.23 184.78 <NA> <unk> numbers <unk> let 's see what we get there so one plus one plus four is six 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 184.6 195.12 <NA> add nine to that we get fifteen add twenty five we get forty add sixty four we get one hundred and four <unk> now look at those numbers <unk> those are not <unk>
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 195.02 202.41 <NA> <unk> fibonacci numbers <unk> but if you look at them closely you 'll see the fibonacci numbers buried inside of them do
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 205.02 214 <NA> <unk> is two times three <unk> fifteen is three times five forty is five times eight two three five eight <unk> who do we appreciate 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 213.99 216.52 <NA> fibonacci of course <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 216.33 229.1 <NA> now as much fun as it is to discover these patterns it 's even more satisfying to understand why they are true <unk> let 's look at that last equation why should the squares of one one
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 229.75 236.36 <NA> <unk> five and eight add up to eight times thirteen <unk> i 'll show you by drawing a simple picture 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 235.96 241.5 <NA> we 'll start with a one by one square and next to that put another
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 255.59 263.71 <NA> <unk> creating one giant rectangle right <unk> now let me ask you a simple question what is the area of the rectangle <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 263.47 273.78 <NA> well on the one hand it 's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it right <unk> just as we created it it 's one squared plus one squared <unk>
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 273.73 279.67 <NA> plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared right <unk> that 's the area
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 280.28 290.44 <NA> on the other hand because it 's a rectangle the area is equal to its height times its base and the height is clearly eight <unk> and the base is five <unk>
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 290.34 298.61 <NA> <unk> plus eight which is the next fibonacci number thirteen <unk> right so the area is also eight times thirteen <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 300.25 310.55 <NA> <unk> the area two different ways they have to be the same number <unk> and that 's why the squares of one one two three five and eight add up to eight times thirteen <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 310.09 315.3 <NA> now if we continue this process we 'll generate rectangles of the form
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 314.99 316.04 <NA> thirteen by <unk>
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 317.29 319.4 <NA> <unk> by thirty four and so on <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 319.2 324.86 <NA> now check this out if you divide thirteen by eight you get one point six two five 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 324.86 329.73 <NA> and if you divide the larger number by the smaller number then these ratios get
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 329.69 342.84 <NA> <unk> closer and closer to about one point six one eight known to many people as the golden ratio a number which has fascinated mathematicians scientists and artists for centuries <unk> 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 342.84 354.31 <NA> now i show all this to you because like so much of mathematics there 's a beautiful side to it that i fear does not get enough attention in our schools we spend lots of time learning about
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 354.39 363.7 <NA> <unk> calculation <unk> but let 's not forget about application including perhaps the most important application of all learning how to think 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 363.47 367.09 <NA> if i could summarize this in one sentence it would be this 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 367.08 373.57 <NA> mathematics is not just solving for x it 's also figuring out why 
ArthurBenjamin_2013G 1 ArthurBenjamin_2013G 373.29 374.69 <NA> thank you very much
