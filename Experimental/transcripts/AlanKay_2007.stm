AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 609.38 617.06 <NA> are a little challenging there and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 616.84 625.08 <NA> act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they had created these artifacts now she had

AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 629.06 634.14 <NA> for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 633.8 636.45 <NA> so they 'll think so they 're cutting out the
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 635.96 642 <NA> little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up but the whole point of this thing is
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 642.92 645.69 <NA> for them to look at this chart
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 645.92 650.05 <NA> and fill it out what have you noticed about what you did

AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 993.46 999.02 <NA> of what 's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it 's tricky to see what 's going on <unk> 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 998.53 1004.03 <NA> and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up <unk> 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1003.57 1004.94 <NA> so when the children see
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1004.9 1008.21 <NA> <unk> this they say ah acceleration 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1008.41 1016.68 <NA> remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways <unk> and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1016.26 1019.52 <NA> it is 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1019.75 1027.8 <NA> so what i 'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1028 1029.97 <NA> like that and they 're getting
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1029.96 1033.75 <NA> <unk> faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys up 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1037.46 1042.42 <NA> then we see the differences <unk> the increase in the speed
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1042.47 1048.3 <NA> is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we 've done that already <unk>
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1050.93 1054.85 <NA> how shall we look and verify that we actually
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1055.53 1059.83 <NA> have it so you can 't tell much from just making the ball
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1059.43 1065.68 <NA> drop there <unk> but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time <unk> 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1066.84 1072.13 <NA> we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1073.53 1074.81 <NA> galileo by the
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1075.19 1076.4 <NA> <unk> did this
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1076.27 1081.59 <NA> very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1082.15 1086.46 <NA> i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1086.28 1088.01 <NA> this is actually
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1087.61 1095.93 <NA> probably a newton and the apple type story but it 's a great story <unk> and i thought i would do just one thing
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1096.01 1103.47 <NA> on the $ one hundred laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1105.32 1108.26 <NA> <unk> so once you have gravity here 's this
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1108.04 1111.81 <NA> increase the speed by something increase the ship 's
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1111.5 1118.38 <NA> speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it 'll crash the space ship 
AlanKay_2007 1 AlanKay_2007 1118.34 1121.48 <NA> but if i oppose gravity here we go
