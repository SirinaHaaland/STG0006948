BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 27.55 36.6 <NA> how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life <unk> and some days that can even be a little scary <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 36.17 47.9 <NA> but what i 'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 47.9 49.96 <NA> to help heal some
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 56.94 69.31 <NA> <unk> a couple of years ago i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 69.54 78.91 <NA> now at the time that i was reading this it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 78.66 80 <NA> so i was basically
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 80.02 88.61 <NA> <unk> just willing to settle for just reading the next wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 88.61 98.88 <NA> but that was actually exactly the point that michael pollan was making in this article it 's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 98.7 102.66 <NA> that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 104.87 114.78 <NA> <unk> happen to know a little bit from my own work about how nasa has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 114.35 119.29 <NA> and that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 118.87 125.25 <NA> by running a kind of <unk> high quality liquid soil over plants ' root systems 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 125.42 129.76 <NA> now to a vegetable plant my apartment has got to be about as
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 129.72 136.93 <NA> <unk> foreign as outer space <unk> but i can offer some natural light and year round climate control
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 136.71 145.6 <NA> fast forward two years later we now have window farms which are vertical hydroponic platforms for food growing indoors <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 145.11 150.05 <NA> and the way it works is that there 's a pump at the bottom which periodically sends this liquid
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 150 158.9 <NA> <unk> nutrient solution up to the top which then trickles down through plants ' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets so there 's no dirt involved 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 158.8 167.81 <NA> now light and temperature vary with each window 's microclimate so a window farm requires a farmer <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 167.32 175.05 <NA> and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm and whether she is going to feed her
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 176.96 184.02 <NA> <unk> back at the time a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 183.53 197.88 <NA> and i really wanted it to be an open project because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the united states right now and could possibly become another area like monsanto where we have a lot of corporate
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 197.51 199.78 <NA> intellectual property in the way of
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 200.55 202.03 <NA> <unk> people 's food 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 201.57 210.64 <NA> so i decided that instead of creating a product what i was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 210.87 218.77 <NA> the first few systems that we created they kind of worked we were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical new york city apartment window <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 218.77 224.87 <NA> and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers all kinds of stuff but the first few systems were these
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 227.95 232.28 <NA> <unk> that martha stewart would definitely never have approved 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 232.15 241.86 <NA> so to bring on more codevelopers what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs we explained how they worked <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 241.86 252.59 <NA> and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems <unk> and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 252.82 254.97 <NA> so actually now on this
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 254.99 262.23 <NA> <unk> website we have eighteen thousand people <unk> and we have window farms all over the world 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 261.89 271.48 <NA> what we 're doing is what nasa or a large corporation would call r & d <unk> or research and development but what we call it is r
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 279.99 289.54 <NA> <unk> that we use air pumps instead of water pumps it took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right but once we did we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 289.38 303.82 <NA> tony in chicago has been taking on growing experiments like lots of other window farmers and he 's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 303.78 304.97 <NA> and window
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 304.93 316.25 <NA> <unk> farmers in finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the finnish winters by outfitting them with led grow lights that they 're now making open source and part of the project <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 315.94 325.08 <NA> so window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software <unk> and with every open source project
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 325.25 335.46 <NA> <unk> the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns <unk> and the universal concerns <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 334.97 342.07 <NA> so my core team and i are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 342.07 346.08 <NA> and we 're able to look out for the needs of newcomers <unk> so for <unk>
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 347.14 349.75 <NA> we provide free <unk> very
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 351.36 360.13 <NA> <unk> so that anyone anywhere around the world can build one of these systems for free <unk> and there 's a patent pending on these systems as well that 's held by the community <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 359.67 370.27 <NA> and to fund the project we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don 't have time to build their own systems 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 370.23 375.11 <NA> now within our community a certain culture has appeared in our culture
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 375.04 382.1 <NA> <unk> it is better to be a tester who supports someone else 's idea than it is to be just the idea guy 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 381.94 395.87 <NA> what we get out of this project is support for our own work as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 395.62 403.11 <NA> but i think that eleen expresses best what we really get out of this which is the actual joy of collaboration
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 404.78 413.31 <NA> <unk> expresses here what it 's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea <unk> built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 413 426.81 <NA> if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we 're all talking about as environmentalists and and food people maybe we just need to ditch the term consumer and get behind the people who are doing stuff 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 426.89 429.94 <NA> open source projects tend to have a momentum of their
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 429.93 440.35 <NA> <unk> own and what we 're seeing is that r & d i y has moved beyond just window farms and leds into solar panels and aquaponic systems <unk> 
BrittaRiley_2011X 1 BrittaRiley_2011X 440.13 449.68 <NA> and we 're building upon innovations of generations who went before us <unk> and we 're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now
