KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 266.12 274.21 <NA> and that 's because everest is so high it 's in the jet stream <unk> and winds are constantly scouring the face so no snow gets to accumulate 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 274.21 278.65 <NA> what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit

KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 332.9 345.06 <NA> so here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what 's called the triangular face it 's the first part of climb it 's done in the dark because it 's actually less steep than what comes next and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark <unk> 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 345.5 353.11 <NA> so that 's what happened the climbers got on the southeast ridge this is the view looking at the southeast ridge the summit would be in the foreground

KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 406.07 415.77 <NA> <unk> all the climbers here are climbing unroped <unk> and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody you 'd wind up just pulling them off with you 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 415.4 418.68 <NA> so each person climbs individually <unk> and <unk>
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 420.16 429.85 <NA> it 's not a straight path at all <unk> it 's very difficult climbing <unk> and there 's always the risk of falling on either side if you fall to your left <unk> you 're going to

KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 876.26 878.56 <NA> and found his way back to the camp
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 879.99 888.43 <NA> <unk> told me that story very quietly but i was absolutely stunned by it i couldn 't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 888.09 896.62 <NA> and then getting up he apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia <unk> and
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 896.13 900.05 <NA> i can only try to speculate on how he did it 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 900.61 907.67 <NA> <unk> what if we had beck hooked up to a spect scan <unk> something that could actually measure brain function 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 908.83 913.92 <NA> just very simply the three parts of the brain the frontal lobe <unk> where you
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 913.68 924.38 <NA> focus your attention and concentration you have the temporal lobe where you form images and keep memories <unk> and the posterior part of your brain which contains the cerebellum which controls motion <unk> 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 924.38 929.52 <NA> and the brain stem where you have your basic maintenance functions like heartbeat and respiration
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 930.17 934.77 <NA> <unk> so let 's take a cut through the brain here <unk> and imagine
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 934.57 941.34 <NA> that beck was hooked up to a spect scan <unk> this measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain <unk> 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 940.85 949.96 <NA> so you have the prefrontal cortex here <unk> lighting up in red this is a pretty evenly distributed scan you have the the middle area where the temporal lobe might
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 950.88 959.29 <NA> <unk> and the posterior portion where the maintenance functions are in the back <unk> this is a roughly normal scan <unk> showing equal distribution of energy 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 959.79 963.88 <NA> now you go to this one and you see how much more
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 963.51 973.49 <NA> the frontal lobes are lighting up this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realizes he 's in danger <unk> he 's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 973.49 979.04 <NA> <unk> these parts of the brain are quieting down he 's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point <unk> 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 978.83 979.97 <NA> and he 's working pretty
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 980.02 984.41 <NA> <unk> hard he 's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 986.32 988.28 <NA> ok but
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 988.24 998.79 <NA> he 's he 's losing ground here he 's running out of energy <unk> it 's too cold he can 't keep his metabolic fires going and you see there 's no more red here his brain is quieting down <unk> 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 998.79 999.9 <NA> he 's collapsed in the
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1000.46 1007.76 <NA> <unk> everything is quiet there 's very little red anywhere beck is powering down <unk> he 's dying <unk> 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1009.88 1018.32 <NA> you go on to the next scan <unk> but in beck 's case <unk> you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1018.31 1024.93 <NA> <unk> he 's beginning to think about his family he 's beginning to have images that are motivating him to to get up he 's
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1030.38 1039.75 <NA> <unk> this is how he 's going to turn thought back into into action <unk> this part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus it 's an area in which
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1039.44 1047.04 <NA> a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists <unk> this is where people make decisions where they develop willpower <unk> 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1047.04 1054.82 <NA> and you can see there 's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain where he 's got images of his family into this area <unk> which is
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1054.75 1056.56 <NA> <unk> powering his will 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1058.26 1066.2 <NA> okay this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it 's actually going to be a motivating factor he 's going to develop enough energy in that area
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1066.2 1068.33 <NA> after a day a night and a day
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1068.14 1071.8 <NA> to actually motivate himself to get up 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1073.53 1075.26 <NA> and you can see here
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1075.85 1086.87 <NA> <unk> he 's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe he 's beginning to focus he can concentrate now he 's thinking about what he 's got to do to save himself so this energy has been transmitted up toward the front
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1086.38 1094.13 <NA> front of his brain and it 's getting quieter down here but he 's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going 
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1094.15 1100.02 <NA> and then that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas <unk> he 's not thinking about his
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1101.3 1106.15 <NA> <unk> he 's getting himself motivated this is the posterior part where his muscles are going to be moving and
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1105.94 1114.61 <NA> he 's going to be pacing himself his heart and lungs are going to pick up speed <unk> so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1114.61 1117.45 <NA> do a spect scan on beck during this
KenKamler_2009P 1 KenKamler_2009P 1117.65 1124.93 <NA> during this survival epic <unk> so here i am taking care of beck at twenty one thousand feet and i felt what i was
