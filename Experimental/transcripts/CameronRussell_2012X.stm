CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 160.63 164.18 <NA> <unk> i always just say oh i was scouted but that means nothing 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 163.87 167.04 <NA> the real way that i became a model
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 166.65 173.54 <NA> is i won a genetic lottery <unk> and i am the recipient of a legacy <unk> and maybe you 're wondering what is a legacy well

CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 209.94 216.88 <NA> but unfortunately i have to inform you that in two thousand and seven a very inspired nyu ph d student counted

CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 227.77 234.77 <NA> <unk> the next question people always ask is can i be a model when i grow up and the first answer is i don 't know they don 't put me in charge of that 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 235.55 245.45 <NA> but the second answer and what i really want to say to these little girls is why you know you can be anything you could be the president of the united states or the inventor of the next internet or

CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 264.83 272.1 <NA> <unk> saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the powerball when you grow up it 's

CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 275.85 285.73 <NA> i will demonstrate for you now ten years of accumulated model knowledge <unk> because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right now so 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 285.3 299.81 <NA> if the photographer is right there <unk> the light is right there like a nice hmi and the client says we want a walking shot this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 305.44 308.72 <NA> <unk> it will look something like this 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 309.49 313.76 <NA> hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle that was i don 't know what happened there
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 314.14 320.9 <NA> <unk> unfortunately after you 've gone to school and you have a rsum and you 've done a few jobs you can 't say anything anymore so
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 320.68 324.96 <NA> if you say you want to be the president of the united states <unk> but your rsum reads underwear
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 325.91 335.67 <NA> <unk> people give you a funny look the next question is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos <unk> but that is only a small component of what 's happening

CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 364.04 370.07 <NA> and i hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 370.07 377.18 <NA> and they are constructions by a group of professionals by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 381.67 385.04 <NA> the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 385.63 390.59 <NA> i do have too many 8 inch heels which i never get to wear except for earlier
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 390.52 396.56 <NA> <unk> but the free stuff that i get is the free stuff that i get in real life and that 's what we don 't like to talk about
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 396.19 402.41 <NA> <unk> i grew up in cambridge and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free

CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 413.72 422.61 <NA> <unk> and i got these free things because of how i look not who i am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 422.61 428.11 <NA> i live in new york and last year of the one hundred and forty thousand teenagers that were stopped and frisked

CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 432.83 442.24 <NA> there are only one hundred and seventy seven thousand young black and latino men in new york so for them it 's not a question of will i get stopped but how many times will i get stopped when will i get stopped 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 441.96 447.29 <NA> when i was researching this talk <unk> i found out that of the 13 year old girls in the united states
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 448.43 454.94 <NA> don 't like their bodies and that number goes to seventy eight % by the time that they 're seventeen <unk> so the last question people
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 454.87 456.65 <NA> <unk> ask me is 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 456.7 464 <NA> what is it like to be a model and i think the answer that they 're looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 463.8 466.81 <NA> you will be so happy and fabulous 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 466.81 474.84 <NA> and when we 're backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that we say it 's really amazing to travel <unk> and it 's amazing to get to work with
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 477.14 481.19 <NA> <unk> and those things are true but they 're only one half of the story because the thing
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 480.97 489.95 <NA> that we never say on camera that i have never said on camera is i am insecure and i 'm insecure because i have to think about what i look like
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 489.79 491.28 <NA> every day
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 491.93 499.92 <NA> <unk> and if you ever are wondering if i have thinner thighs and shinier hair will i be happier 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 500.01 507.28 <NA> <unk> you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and they 're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 508.14 514.78 <NA> <unk> when i was writing this talk <unk> i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 514.38 520.72 <NA> i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look i 've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 520.32 526.54 <NA> and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn 't always make me happy 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 526.17 529.97 <NA> but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 530.19 536.69 <NA> of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries <unk> but
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 536.32 541.34 <NA> i 'm also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it 's great that i got to come
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 541.09 548.72 <NA> before ten or twenty or thirty years had passed and i 'd had more agency in my career because maybe then i wouldn 't tell the story of how i got my first job <unk> 
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 548.71 553.1 <NA> or maybe i wouldn 't tell the story of how i paid for college which seems so important right now
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 554.72 561.69 <NA> <unk> takeaway to this talk i hope it 's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image
CameronRussell_2012X 1 CameronRussell_2012X 561.69 565.24 <NA> in our perceived successes and our perceived failures
