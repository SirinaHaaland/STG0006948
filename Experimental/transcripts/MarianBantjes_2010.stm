MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 195.98 204.91 <NA> i 'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works this is a piece that i did for the guardian newspaper in the <unk> u k they have a magazine that they

MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 212.85 216.34 <NA> i started by creating a series of tiling units <unk>

MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 231.4 242.54 <NA> but then as well i was able to just flip them rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns 
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 242.5 245.15 <NA> so here 's the word puzzle again <unk>

MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 250 252.63 <NA> <unk> it 's extremely difficult to read 
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 253.04 262.08 <NA> but all i have to do is fill certain areas of those <unk> letterforms and i can bring those words out of the background pattern <unk> 
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 261.59 264.07 <NA> but maybe that 's a little too obvious 
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 263.89 274.29 <NA> so then i can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves <unk> and this way <unk> working with the art director i 'm able to bring it to just <unk>
MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 274.19 279.97 <NA> <unk> the right point that it 's puzzling for the audience they can figure out that there 's something they have to read

MarianBantjes_2010 1 MarianBantjes_2010 360.49 373.36 <NA> so it 's a little bit unexpected but in a way it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or or they make in school and give to their parents which is in itself a form of honor <unk>
