EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 12.94 15.63 <NA> <unk> an ecologist and sean 's a physicist
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 15.63 24.96 <NA> and we both study complex networks <unk> and we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short ted talk about the ecology of war and we realized that we
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 25.1 34.05 <NA> <unk> connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met and then we thought you know there are thousands of other talks out there especially tedx talks that are popping up all over the world 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 33.59 41.11 <NA> how are they connected and what does that global conversation look like so sean 's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that sean gourley exactly so
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 40.93 49.96 <NA> we took twenty four thousand tedx talks from around the world one hundred and forty seven different countries <unk> and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 50.88 60.38 <NA> <unk> the ideas behind them and we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other <unk> and so of course if you 're going to do this kind of stuff you need a lot of data so the data that you 've got
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 60.2 71.54 <NA> is a great thing called youtube and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube all the comments all the views who 's watching it where are they watching it <unk> what are they saying in the comments <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 71.54 79.43 <NA> but we can also pull up using speech to text translation we can pull the entire transcript and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 79.78 90.78 <NA> <unk> so we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things we can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer line by line extracting key concepts from this <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 90.78 96.98 <NA> and we take those key concepts and they sort of form this mathematical structure of an idea <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 96.52 98.75 <NA> and we call that the meme ome 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 98.38 104.94 <NA> and the meme ome you know quite simply is the mathematics that underlies an idea <unk> and we can do some pretty interesting analysis
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 104.9 107.13 <NA> <unk> with it <unk> which i want to share with you now 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 106.7 116.76 <NA> so each idea has its own meme ome and each idea is unique with that but of course <unk> ideas they borrow from each other they kind of steal sometimes and they certainly build on each other <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 116.75 129.82 <NA> and we can go through mathematically and take the meme ome from one talk and compare it to the meme ome from every other talk and if there 's a similarity between the two of them <unk> we can create a link and represent that as a graph just like eric and i are connected
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 130.02 134.56 <NA> so that 's theory that 's great <unk> let 's see how it works in actual practice <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 134.16 144.49 <NA> so what we 've got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 144.18 149.81 <NA> and what we did on this is we analyzed the top twenty five percent of these <unk> and we started to see where the connections
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 150.49 160.31 <NA> <unk> where they connected with each other <unk> cameron russell talking about image and beauty connected over into europe <unk> we 've got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 159.97 167.66 <NA> and we 've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 167.53 174.75 <NA> so from this we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection but luckily computer technology allows us to go out into
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 176.21 185.69 <NA> <unk> so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this and the similar talks kind of smash together <unk> and the different ones fly apart <unk> and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful eb 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 185.53 195.2 <NA> so i want to just point out here that every node is a talk they 're linked if they share similar ideas and that comes from a machine reading of entire talk transcripts <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 195.2 204.91 <NA> and then all these these topics that pop out they 're not from tags and keywords they come from the network structure of interconnected ideas <unk> keep going sg absolutely so i got a little
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 204.87 206.68 <NA> <unk> quick on that but he 's going to slow me down <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 206.51 214.33 <NA> we 've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media you 've got of course the human brain right next to healthcare which you might expect 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 214.33 224.09 <NA> but also you 've got video games which is sort of adjacent as those two spaces interface with each other <unk> but i want to take you into one cluster that 's particularly important to me <unk> and that 's the environment <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 223.87 224.99 <NA> and i want to kind of zoom
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 225.01 227.7 <NA> <unk> on that and see if we can get a little more resolution 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 227.52 237.83 <NA> so as we go in here what we start to see apply the physics engine again we see what 's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones the structure starts to emerge <unk>
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 237.78 250.08 <NA> where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world so you 've got food economy and local food at the top you 've got greenhouse gases solar and nuclear waste what
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 250.04 258.36 <NA> <unk> you 're getting is a range of smaller conversations each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share creating a broader concept of the environment <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 258.13 269.76 <NA> and of course from here we can go and and zoom in and see well <unk> what are young people looking at <unk> and they 're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion this is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 269.75 271.21 <NA> if we split along
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 271.03 274.6 <NA> gender lines we can see females resonating heavily with
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 274.37 279.94 <NA> food economy <unk> but also out there in hope and optimism and so there 's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 279.95 288.13 <NA> throw to eric for the next part eb yeah i mean <unk> just to point out here you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on youtube <unk>
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 288.13 295.31 <NA> <unk> let 's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment and look at all the talks together 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 295.07 299.84 <NA> now often when we 're faced with this amount of content we do a couple of things to simplify it
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 300.61 304.17 <NA> <unk> we might just say well <unk> what are the most popular talks out there <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 304.17 313.97 <NA> and a few rise to the surface there 's a talk about gratitude there 's another one about personal health and nutrition <unk> and of course there 's got to be one about porn right
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 313.66 325.2 <NA> <unk> and so then we might say well gratitude that was last year what 's trending now what 's the popular talk now <unk> and we can see that the new emerging top trending topic is about digital privacy
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 325.61 330.91 <NA> <unk> so this is great it simplifies things but there 's so much creative content that 's just buried at the bottom <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 330.91 336.93 <NA> and i hate that how do we bubble stuff up to the surface that 's maybe really creative and interesting well
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 336.86 341.16 <NA> we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 340.76 354.97 <NA> remember it 's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics and let 's say we could take two of them like cities and genetics and say well are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines and that 's essentially this kind of creative remix
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 354.99 362.86 <NA> <unk> is one of the hallmarks of innovation <unk> well here 's one by jessica green about the microbial ecology of buildings it 's literally defining a new field <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 362.86 370.82 <NA> and we could go back to those topics and say well <unk> what talks are central to those conversations in the cities cluster one of the most central was one by
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 370.61 375.14 <NA> by mitch joachim about ecological cities and in the genetics cluster
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 375 389.68 <NA> we have a talk about synthetic biology by craig venter these are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline we could go the other direction and say well <unk> what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields we used a measure of ecological diversity to get this 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 389.69 393.77 <NA> like a talk by steven pinker on the history of violence very synthetic 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 393.31 401.69 <NA> and then of course there are talks that are so unique they 're kind of out in the stratosphere in their own special place <unk> and we call that the colleen flanagan index
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 401.38 404.91 <NA> <unk> and if you don 't know colleen she 's an artist and i asked her
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 405.05 410.31 <NA> <unk> 's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space and apparently it smells like bacon 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 410.33 412.14 <NA> i wouldn 't know
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 412.36 423.03 <NA> so we 're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields ones that are central to their topic <unk> and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate <unk>
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 422.93 428.22 <NA> <unk> fields <unk> okay we never would have found those with our obsession with what 's trending now <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 430.29 436.39 <NA> <unk> of complexity or the patterns of how things are connected sg so that 's exactly right we 've got
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 436.22 440.26 <NA> ourselves in a world that 's massively complex <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 439.98 444.73 <NA> and we 've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 444.5 448.97 <NA> and those algorithms whilst being kind of useful are also very very narrow <unk> 
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 448.97 454.94 <NA> and we can do better than that because we can realize that their complexity is not random it has mathematical structure
EricBerlow_2013U 1 EricBerlow_2013U 455.01 466.02 <NA> and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what 's being said to see what 's not being said <unk> and to be a little bit more human and hopefully a little smarter thank you
