DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 37.22 42.31 <NA> <unk> and like many immigrants at the time they arrived on the lower east side in new york city
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 42.13 50.05 <NA> and they encountered a crazy melting pot what was amazing about their generation was that they were not only building new lives in this
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 52.05 57.97 <NA> <unk> but they were also literally building the city <unk> i 've always been fascinated by those decades and by that history <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 57.97 63.61 <NA> and i would often beg my grandmother to tell me as many stories as possible about the old new york <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 63.78 72.79 <NA> but she would often just shrug it off tell me to eat more meatballs more pasta <unk> and so i very rarely got any of the history that i wanted to hear about 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 72.84 74.96 <NA> the new york city that i encountered

DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 85.07 94.97 <NA> at first i thought i wanted to go work abroad so i took a job with unicef in kenya <unk> but it felt weird to me that i knew more about local kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown i
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 94.96 101.99 <NA> took a job with the city of new york but very quickly felt frustrated with the slowness of government bureaucracy <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 102.13 103.98 <NA> i even took a job at google
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 105.05 111.78 <NA> <unk> very fast i drank the kool aid and believed almost wholeheartedly that technology could solve all social problems
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 111.8 115.29 <NA> <unk> but i still didn 't feel like i was making the world a better place 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 115.46 123.7 <NA> it was in two thousand and nine that my friend and now business partner james ramsey alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site which is
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 123.52 124.87 <NA> this this is the former
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 125 126.03 <NA> <unk> trolley terminal
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 125.72 131.62 <NA> that was the depot for passengers traveling over the williamsburg bridge from brooklyn to
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 131.62 138.19 <NA> manhattan <unk> and it was open between one thousand nine hundred and eight and one thousand nine hundred and forty eight just around the time when my grandparents were
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 137.85 144.28 <NA> living right in the area <unk> and we learned also that the site was entirely abandoned in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 144.39 149.99 <NA> fascinated by this discovery we begged the authorities to draw us into the space 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 150.43 153.41 <NA> <unk> we finally got a tour <unk> and this is what we saw 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 153.41 164.04 <NA> now this photo doesn 't really do it justice it 's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space it 's a football field of unused land
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 163.85 174.5 <NA> immediately below a very crowded area of the city and it almost feels like you 're indiana jones on an archaeological dig <unk> and all the details are all still there it 's really pretty remarkable 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 175.43 178.86 <NA> <unk> the site itself is located at the very heart of the lower east side 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 178.66 182.58 <NA> and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 182.38 189.57 <NA> new york city has two thirds the green space per resident as other big cities <unk> and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 189.57 197.82 <NA> so we immediately started thinking about how we could take this site and turn it into something that could be used for the public but also could potentially even be green 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 197.51 204.73 <NA> our plan in a nutshell is to draw natural sunlight underground using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 205.11 211.51 <NA> <unk> directs it below the city sidewalks and would allow plants and trees to grow with the light that 's directed underneath 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 211.47 215.83 <NA> with this approach you could take a site that looks like this today
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 215.37 217.93 <NA> and transform it into something
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 217.5 219.37 <NA> that looks like this 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 219.9 228.92 <NA> in two thousand and eleven we first released some of these images <unk> and what was funny was a lot of people said to us oh it kind of looks like the high line underground
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 229.93 231.05 <NA> <unk> and
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 230.86 238.22 <NA> so what our nickname ended up becoming and what ended up sticking was the lowline so the lowline was born 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 237.82 243.05 <NA> what was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 242.8 249.93 <NA> <unk> and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible <unk> so like a crazy person i decided to quit my job and
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 250 257.85 <NA> focus entirely on this project here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 257.57 266.46 <NA> here 's the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology you can see the six solar collectors at the center there <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 266.12 276.33 <NA> and here 's the full exhibit all put together in this warehouse you can see the solar canopy overhead the light streaming in and this entirely live green space below 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 275.84 279.94 <NA> so in the course of just a few weeks tens of thousands of people came to see
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 280.13 288.04 <NA> our exhibit and since that time we 've grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 287.79 292.12 <NA> here 's a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the line 's site 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 291.89 298.43 <NA> and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next ten years <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 298.43 304.94 <NA> notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there 's really a lack of green space so what we 're proposing is really something
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 304.87 306.86 <NA> <unk> that will add
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 306.52 316.92 <NA> one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood but more importantly will introduce a really community driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 316.87 324.81 <NA> <unk> and right now we 're focusing very closely on how we engage with the city of new york on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 326.54 330.21 <NA> <unk> here 's our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 330.21 340.78 <NA> so here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city and invite people into this warm underground space 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 340.6 346.68 <NA> in the middle of winter when it 's absolutely freezing outside the last place you 'd want to go would be an outdoor space or outdoor park 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 346.25 350.37 <NA> the lowline would really be a four season space and a respite for the city <unk> 
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 350.75 354.91 <NA> so i like to think that the lowline actually brings my own family 's story
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 354.84 369.58 <NA> <unk> full circle <unk> if my grandparents and my parents were really focused on building the city up and out i think my generation is focused on reclaiming the spaces that we already have <unk> rediscovering our shared history and reimagining how we can make our communities
DanBarasch_2014S 1 DanBarasch_2014S 369.58 373.37 <NA> more interesting more beautiful and more just thanks
