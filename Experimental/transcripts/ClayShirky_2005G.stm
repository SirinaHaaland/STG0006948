ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 25 28.98 <NA> framing of that problem is called coordination costs
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 28.58 36.34 <NA> and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output 
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 36.34 46.6 <NA> and we 've had a classic answer for coordination costs which is <unk> if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people you start an institution right you raise some resources you found something it can be
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 46.44 49.87 <NA> private or public it can be for profit or not profit it can be large or

ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 68.1 74.35 <NA> there has been a second answer which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure 
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 74.35 79.97 <NA> to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system

ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 262.37 277.24 <NA> you end up with a professional class <unk> look at the change here we 've gone from people with photos to photographers right we 've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the mermaid parade or whatever else they 're sent out
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 280.14 288.66 <NA> <unk> when you build cooperation into the infrastructure which is the flickr answer you can leave the people where they are

ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 314.2 316.38 <NA> what flickr does
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 315.93 322.85 <NA> is it replaces planning with coordination and this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems

ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 338.81 349.2 <NA> right we 're now able to do that kind of thing with groups to say instead of we must make an advance plan we must have a five year projection of where the wikipedia is going to be or whatever 
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 349.19 354.64 <NA> you can just say let 's coordinate the group effort <unk> and let 's deal with it as we go because we 're now
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 355.02 360.34 <NA> <unk> coordinated that we don 't have to take on the the problems of deciding in advance what to do 
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 360.15 366.13 <NA> so here 's another example this one 's somewhat more somber these are photos on flickr tagged iraq 
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 368.64 375.11 <NA> and everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the mermaid parade is is even harder here
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 375.31 380.99 <NA> <unk> there are more pictures there are more photographers it 's taken over a wider geographic area
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 380.68 385.92 <NA> the photos are spread out over a longer period of time and

ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 445.29 448.18 <NA> this is called a power law distribution
ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 447.99 454.97 <NA> <unk> it appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as

ClayShirky_2005G 1 ClayShirky_2005G 455.64 458 <NA> this is often what you get
