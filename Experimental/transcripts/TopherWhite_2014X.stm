TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 25.21 28.71 <NA> <unk> i visited the rainforests of borneo for the very first time
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 30.26 34.39 <NA> <unk> and as you might imagine <unk> it was the overwhelming sounds of the forest
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 34.21 36.09 <NA> that struck me the most there
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 36.17 39.09 <NA> 's this constant cacophony of noise 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 38.99 48.61 <NA> some things actually do stick out for example this here is a big bird a rhinoceros hornbill <unk> this buzzing is a cicada <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 53.85 56.71 <NA> <unk> actually singing to each other over a great distance 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 58.59 64.27 <NA> the place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve which is why you can hear so many of them <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 64.32 73.75 <NA> but in fact the most important noise that was coming out of the forest that time was one that i didn 't notice and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 73.83 78.68 <NA> so as i said this was a gibbon reserve <unk> they spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 79.9 87.47 <NA> <unk> they also have to spend a lot of their time protecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side <unk> and so if we take the sound of the forest
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 86.98 96.24 <NA> and we actually turn down the gibbons the insects and the rest in the background the entire time in recordings you heard was the sound of a chainsaw
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 96.24 104.97 <NA> at great distance <unk> they had three full time guards who were posted posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 104.96 113.26 <NA> <unk> illegal logging <unk> and one day <unk> we went walking again as tourists out into the forest and within five minutes ' walk <unk> we stumbled upon
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 113.08 118.45 <NA> somebody who was just sawing a tree down <unk> five minutes ' walk a few hundred meters from the ranger station <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 118.45 123.78 <NA> they hadn 't been able to hear the chainsaws <unk> because as you heard the forest is very very loud it
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 125.04 126.76 <NA> <unk> as quite unacceptable
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 126.57 131.65 <NA> that in this modern time just a few hundred meters away from a ranger station
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 131.31 140.71 <NA> in a sanctuary that in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up it sounds impossible <unk> but in fact it was quite true <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 141.27 145.57 <NA> so how do we stop illegal logging it 's really tempting as an engineer always to come up with a <unk>
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 147.6 154.97 <NA> <unk> solution <unk> but in fact you 're in the rainforest it has to be simple <unk> it has to be scalable <unk> and so what we also noticed while were there
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 154.99 159.86 <NA> <unk> was that everything we needed was already there <unk> we could build a system
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 159.55 163.04 <NA> that would allow us to stop this using what 's already there 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 163.42 171.29 <NA> who was there what was already in the forest well <unk> we had people <unk> we had this group there that was dedicated three full time guards that was dedicated to go and stop it <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 171.01 174.77 <NA> but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 175.25 185.32 <NA> <unk> the real surprise this is the big one was that there was connectivity out in the forest there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere we 're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road there 's
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 185.27 192.9 <NA> <unk> certainly no electricity <unk> but they had very good cell phone service these people in the towns were on facebook all the time they 're surfing the web on their phones <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 200.52 208.15 <NA> <unk> because people can 't hear them <unk> and send an alert <unk> but you have to have a device to go up in the trees so if we can use
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 207.69 212.47 <NA> some device to listen to the sounds of the forest <unk> connect to the cell phone network that 's there <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 212.47 217.45 <NA> and send an alert to people on the ground <unk> perhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 218.34 224.47 <NA> but let 's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest because it 's something that we 've definitely all heard about
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 224.16 228.52 <NA> forever people in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest since
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 228.39 229.58 <NA> we were kids
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 229.87 244.31 <NA> <unk> and it seems that the message has never changed we 've got to save the rainforest it 's super urgent this many football fields have been destroyed <unk> yesterday and yet here we are today about half of the rainforest remains <unk> and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 244.96 250.17 <NA> but in fact <unk> this is the little known fact that i didn 't realize at the time <unk> deforestation accounts
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 250.79 258.3 <NA> <unk> more greenhouse gas than all of the world 's planes trains cars trucks and ships combined it 's the second highest contributor to climate change 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 258.17 266.58 <NA> also according to interpol as much as ninety percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 266.6 272.79 <NA> <unk> like the illegal logging that we saw <unk> so if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 272.79 277.09 <NA> then in fact we could eat heavily into this seventeen percent
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 276.87 279.61 <NA> and potentially have a major impact in the short term
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 280.05 283.57 <NA> <unk> be the cheapest fastest way to fight climate change
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 284.55 293.54 <NA> and so here 's the system that we imagine it looks super high tech the moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw it sends an alert
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 293.54 298.27 <NA> through the standard gsm network that 's already there to a ranger in the field
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 297.84 304.94 <NA> who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging it 's no more about going out and finding a tree that 's been cut
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 305.01 311.45 <NA> it 's not about seeing a tree from a satellite in an area that 's been clear cut <unk> it 's about real time intervention <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 311.17 318.68 <NA> so i said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it but in fact <unk> actually as you saw they weren 't able to do it so it may not be so cheap and fast 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 318.67 324.93 <NA> but if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones <unk> it could be pretty cheap cell phones are thrown away
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 325.04 332.67 <NA> <unk> the hundreds of millions every year hundreds of millions in the u s alone not counting the rest of the world which of course
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 332.21 339.33 <NA> we should do <unk> but in fact cell phones are great <unk> they 're full of sensors <unk> they can listen to the sounds of the forest <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 338.84 344.34 <NA> we do have to protect them we have to put them in this box that you see here and we do have to power them <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 345.02 354.16 <NA> powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy any sort of solar power under a tree canopy was
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 354.92 363.91 <NA> as yet unsolved problem <unk> and that 's this unique solar panel design that you see here <unk> which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process these are strips
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 363.91 367.88 <NA> that are cut down <unk> so this is
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 367.7 369.46 <NA> me putting it all together
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 369.03 375.43 <NA> in my parents ' garage actually thanks very much to them for allowing me to do that as you can see <unk> this is
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 375.42 379.37 <NA> a device up in a tree what you can see from here
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 379.96 390.42 <NA> <unk> that they are pretty well obscured up in the tree canopy at a distance that 's important <unk> because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance <unk> allowing them to cover about three square kilometers if
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 390.42 392.04 <NA> someone were to take them
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 391.81 394.49 <NA> <unk> it would make the area unprotected <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 394.72 396.39 <NA> so
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 396.22 400.02 <NA> does it actually work <unk> well to test it <unk> we took it back to
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 400.73 404.37 <NA> <unk> not the same place but another place to another gibbon reserve
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 404.2 407.43 <NA> that was threatened daily by illegal logging 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 407.78 412.56 <NA> on the very second day <unk> it picked up illegal chainsaw noises <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 412.37 423.54 <NA> we were able to get a real time alert i got an email on my phone actually we had just climbed the tree everyone had just gotten back down all these guys are smoking cigarettes <unk> and then i get an email <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 423.05 426.93 <NA> and they all quiet down <unk> and in fact you can hear the chainsaw
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 426.5 429.94 <NA> really really faint in the background but no one had noticed it until that moment
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 430.32 436.54 <NA> and so then we took off to actually stop these loggers i was pretty nervous <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 436.26 443.98 <NA> this is the moment where we 've actually arrived close to where the loggers are this is the moment where you can see where i 'm actually regretting perhaps
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 443.55 450.08 <NA> the entire endeavor i 'm not really sure what 's on the other side of this hill that guy 's much braver than i am <unk>
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 450.49 458.69 <NA> <unk> but he went so i had to go <unk> walking up and in fact he made it over the hill <unk> and interrupted the loggers
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 458.49 460.01 <NA> in the act 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 459.64 468 <NA> for them it was such a surprise they had never ever been interrupted before that it was such an impressive event for them that we 've heard from our partners they have not been back since 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 468 474.68 <NA> they were in fact great guys they showed us how the entire operation works <unk> and what they really convinced us on the spot was that if
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 475.04 479.91 <NA> <unk> can show up in real time and stop people <unk> it 's enough of a deterrent they won 't come back 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 481.04 482.43 <NA> so thank you 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 489.38 492.9 <NA> word of this spread <unk> possibly because we told a lot of people
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 492.71 500.14 <NA> <unk> and in fact <unk> then some really amazing stuff started to happen people from around the world started to send us emails phone calls
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 500.25 503.56 <NA> <unk> what we saw was that people throughout asia people throughout
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 503.1 511.09 <NA> africa people throughout south america <unk> they told us that they could use it too <unk> and what 's most important what we 'd found that we thought might be exceptional 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 510.66 519.28 <NA> in the forest there was pretty good cell phone service that was not exceptional we were told <unk> and that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 519.03 525.04 <NA> and then something really amazing happened which was that people started sending us their own old cell phones <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 524.85 529.91 <NA> so in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground people who are already there
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 529.92 541.04 <NA> who can both improve and use the existing connectivity <unk> and we 're using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife so to speak <unk> 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 540.67 546.2 <NA> and if the rest of the device can be completely recycled then we believe it 's an entirely upcycled device 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 546.73 550.02 <NA> so again <unk> this didn 't come because of any sort of
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 551.24 556.11 <NA> <unk> just came from using what 's already there <unk> and i 'm thoroughly convinced that if it 's not phones 
TopherWhite_2014X 1 TopherWhite_2014X 555.77 563.29 <NA> that there 's always going to be enough there that you can build similar solutions that can be very effective in new contexts thank you very much
