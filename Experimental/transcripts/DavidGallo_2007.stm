DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 86.75 96.93 <NA> already we 've found the world 's highest mountains the world 's deepest valleys <unk> underwater lakes underwater waterfalls a lot of that we shared with you from the stage and in a place where we thought no life at all 
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 96.69 104.49 <NA> we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don 't know much about this planet at all there 's still
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 105.02 113.17 <NA> <unk> percent and either that ninety seven percent is empty or just full of surprises <unk> but i want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing <unk>
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 113.17 116.01 <NA> cephalopods head foots

DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 125 132.98 <NA> fascinating how cephalopods can with their incredible eyes <unk> sense their surroundings look at light look at patterns here 's an octopus moving across the reef 
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 132.98 137.89 <NA> finds a spot to settle down curls up and then disappears into the background <unk> 
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 137.82 139.78 <NA> tough thing to do 
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 140.52 150.23 <NA> in the next bit we 're going to see a couple squid now males when they fight if they 're really aggressive they turn white and these two males are fighting <unk> they do it by bouncing their butts together which is an interesting
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 151.72 161.03 <NA> <unk> here 's a male on the left and a female on the right and the male has managed to split his coloration coloration so the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid in him

DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 179.96 182.31 <NA> <unk> not just a squid phenomenon with males but i don 't know 
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 184.19 191.61 <NA> cuttlefish i love cuttlefish <unk> this is a giant australian cuttlefish and there he is his droopy little eyes up here

DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 196.79 204.67 <NA> a crevice <unk> and watch his watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae disappears right into the background
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 205.98 215.62 <NA> positively amazing here 's two males fighting once again they 're smart enough these cephalopods they know not to hurt each other but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 215.82 218.08 <NA> that 's an amazing thing 
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 219.06 229.97 <NA> here 's an octopus sometimes they don 't want to be seen when they move because predators can see them <unk> this guy can make himself look like a rock and looking at his environment can actually slide across the bottom

DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 240.52 246 <NA> so we 're learning lots new from the shallow water still exploring the deep but learning lots from the shallow water there
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 246 254.97 <NA> 's a good reason why the shallow water 's full of predators and if you 're an octopus or a cephalopod you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 255.25 263.44 <NA> in the next scene you 're going to see a nice coral bottom <unk> and you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn 't use your camouflage use your skin to change
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 263.44 267.39 <NA> color and texture here 's some algae in the foreground
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 267.68 272.1 <NA> and an octopus ain 't that amazing now

DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 285.69 289.31 <NA> so he 's bluffing let 's do it backwards i thought he was joking when he first showed it to me i thought it
DavidGallo_2007 1 DavidGallo_2007 289.31 299.2 <NA> was all graphics so here here it is in reverse watch the skin color watch the skin texture just an amazing animal it can change color and texture to match the surroundings
