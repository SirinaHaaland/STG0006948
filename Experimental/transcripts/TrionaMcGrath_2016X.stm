TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 19.33 24.87 <NA> the oceans cover two thirds of our planet <unk> they provide half the oxygen we

TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 37.88 43.74 <NA> people used to think that the oceans were so vast that they wouldn 't be affected by human activities <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 43.7 49.63 <NA> well today i 'm going to tell you about a serious reality that is changing our oceans
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 49.44 54.61 <NA> called ocean acidification or the evil twin of climate change
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 55.35 57.71 <NA> did you know that the oceans have absorbed

TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 63.42 72.55 <NA> now this is just another great service provided by the oceans since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that 's causing climate change 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 72.81 79.52 <NA> but as we keep pumping more and more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 79.96 86.06 <NA> <unk> more is dissolving into the oceans and this is what 's changing our ocean chemistry 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 86.83 92.15 <NA> when carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater it undergoes a number of chemical reactions 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 92.15 97.25 <NA> now lucky for you i don 't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 96.88 103.4 <NA> but i 'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean the seawater ph goes down <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 103.21 104.97 <NA> and this basically means that there
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 104.93 107.97 <NA> <unk> is an increase in ocean acidity <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 107.84 116.04 <NA> and this whole process is called ocean acidification and it 's happening alongside climate change <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 115.88 120.84 <NA> scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 120.5 128.56 <NA> this figure is an important time series in hawaii and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide

TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 181.04 190.68 <NA> now i 'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data to to monitor a changing ocean firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter so <unk>
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 190.63 197.8 <NA> as you can imagine in the north atlantic we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness but
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 200.55 209.53 <NA> <unk> so we lower this instrument over the side of the ship <unk> and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom that can tell us information about the surrounding water <unk> such as temperature
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 209.33 211.19 <NA> or dissolved oxygen 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 210.95 220.55 <NA> and then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles <unk> so we start at the bottom which can be over four kilometers deep just off our continental shelf <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 220.55 224.77 <NA> and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 225 233.12 <NA> <unk> take the seawater back on the deck <unk> and then we can either analyze them on the ship or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 232.66 239.42 <NA> but why should we care how is ocean acidification going to affect all of us 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 240.22 243.95 <NA> well here are the worrying facts 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 244.24 250.32 <NA> there has already been an increase in ocean acidity of twenty six percent
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 252.32 254.91 <NA> <unk> which is directly due to human activities <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 255.17 259.76 <NA> unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 259.76 266.37 <NA> we 're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of one hundred and seventy percent
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 265.88 274.84 <NA> by the end of this century <unk> i mean this is within our children 's lifetime this rate of
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 285.99 293.33 <NA> <unk> so our marine life have never ever experienced such a fast rate of change before <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 293.33 297.88 <NA> so we literally could not know how they 're going to cope <unk> 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 298.53 304.91 <NA> now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago <unk> which was much slower
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 304.99 311.99 <NA> <unk> what we 're seeing today <unk> and this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species

TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 316.54 323.87 <NA> studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well but many are showing a negative response 
TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 324.58 329.55 <NA> one of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases the

TrionaMcGrath_2016X 1 TrionaMcGrath_2016X 333.98 342.69 <NA> now these ions are basically the building blocks for many marine species to make their shells for example crabs
