JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 28.82 42.36 <NA> because cities are about people they 're places where people come together for all kinds of exchange <unk> and besides skylines are highly specific urban habitats with their own insects plants and animals <unk> and even their own weather <unk>

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 88.02 94.13 <NA> the projects i 'm going to show you today use the idea of building relationships as the key driver for design 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 94.3 99.96 <NA> here 's an example of what i mean recently <unk> we were asked to design a center for social justice
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 103.01 114.03 <NA> <unk> they asked us for a building that could break down traditional barriers between different groups and in doing so create possibilities for meaningful conversations around social justice

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 175 182.73 <NA> <unk> 's pretty hard to get a kitchen and a fireplace in a building like this with the building codes but it was so important to the concept we got it done <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 182.75 187.03 <NA> and now the central space works for big social gatherings

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 245.59 252.44 <NA> we chose the building method because it connects people to each other and to the environment <unk>

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 330.92 334.98 <NA> <unk> so we invented a way to use balconies as the new social connectors <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 335.03 342.73 <NA> the shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition as you go up the tower the result of this is that

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 347.42 352.23 <NA> you can lean over your balcony and say hey just like you would across the backyard

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 411.26 423.9 <NA> so i 've shown how tall buildings can be social connectors <unk> but what about public architecture how can we create better social cohesion in public buildings and civic spaces <unk> and why is it important 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 423.47 425.02 <NA> public architecture is

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 428.97 434.56 <NA> about fifteen years ago in chicago they started to replace old police stations <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 434.16 438.16 <NA> and they built this identical model all over the city

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 443.31 448.51 <NA> the communities didn 't feel invested in the process or feel a sense of ownership of these buildings 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 448.02 453.83 <NA> it was equality in the sense that everybody gets the same police station but it wasn 't equity in the sense

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 462.73 470.4 <NA> <unk> there 's a debate about whether architecture can even do anything to improve social relationships <unk> but i believe
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 470.16 474.38 <NA> that we need architecture and every tool in our tool kit
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 473.89 474.93 <NA> to improve
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 477.89 484.38 <NA> <unk> policy reforms have been recommended in order to rebuild trust <unk> but my team and i wondered if

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 494.57 504.97 <NA> so we reached out to community members and police officers in north lawndale it 's a neighborhood in chicago where the police station is perceived as a scary fortress surrounded by a parking lot
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 504.84 505.9 <NA> <unk> lot 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 505.71 512.68 <NA> in north lawndale people are afraid of police and of going anywhere near the police station even to report a crime <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 512.25 520.63 <NA> so we organized this brainstorming session with both groups participating and we came up with this whole new idea for the police station <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 520.59 529.94 <NA> it 's called polis station polis is a greek word that means a place with a sense of community <unk> it 's based on the idea
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 529.92 536.17 <NA> that if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions between police and community members 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 536.17 541.61 <NA> you can rebuild that relationship and activate the neighborhood at the same time <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 541.63 549.72 <NA> instead of the police station as a scary fortress you get highly active spaces on the public side of the station
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 550 553.65 <NA> <unk> that spark conversation like a barbershop a coffee shop
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 553.45 558.21 <NA> or sports courts as well <unk> both cops and kids said they love sports 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 557.78 566.79 <NA> these insights came directly from the community members and the police officers themselves and as designers our role was just to
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 566.33 575.02 <NA> connect the dots and suggest the first step <unk> so with the help of the city and the parks <unk> we were able to raise funds and design and
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 576.69 582.82 <NA> <unk> right on the police station parking lot <unk> it 's a start <unk> but is it rebuilding trust the
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 582.42 592.57 <NA> people in north lawndale say the kids are using the courts every day and they even organize tournaments like this one shown here <unk> and once in a while an officer joins in <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 593.73 602.77 <NA> but now they even have basketballs inside the station that kids can borrow and recently they 've asked us to expand the courts and build a park on the site 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 605.11 607.4 <NA> <unk> report something astonishing <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 606.94 610.42 <NA> before there was fear of going anywhere the station <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 610.42 617.72 <NA> and now they say there 's a sense that the court is safer than other courts nearby and they prefer their kids to play here <unk> 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 617.59 624.98 <NA> so maybe in the future on the public side of the station <unk> you might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 624.73 629.97 <NA> or reserve the community room for a birthday party or renew your driver 's license or get

JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 656.58 666.25 <NA> but reimagining the buildings for the future is going to require engaging the people who live there engaging the public can be intimidating
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 665.88 673.99 <NA> and i 've felt that too but maybe that 's because in architecture school we don 't really learn how to engage the public in the act of design 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 673.65 679.1 <NA> we 're taught to defend our design against criticism <unk> but i think that can change
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 680.41 684.66 <NA> so if we can focus the design mind on creating
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 684.66 690.72 <NA> positive reinforcing relationships in architecture and through architecture i believe
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 690.33 699.41 <NA> we can do much more than create individual buildings <unk> we can reduce the stress and the polarization in our urban habitats 
JeanneGang_2016W 1 JeanneGang_2016W 699.73 705.17 <NA> we can create relationships <unk> we can help steady this planet we all share
