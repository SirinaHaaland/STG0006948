MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 16.78 25.08 <NA> i suddenly realized that the next day was mother 's day and i hadn 't gotten anything for my mom <unk> so i started thinking about
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 25 32.43 <NA> what should i get my mom for mother 's day <unk> i thought why don 't i make her an interactive mother 's day card
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 31.94 38.67 <NA> using the scratch software that i 'd been developing with my research group at the mit media lab 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 38.63 46.65 <NA> we developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 46.22 49.83 <NA> and then share their creations with one another <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 50.03 54.28 <NA> so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 53.97 54.97 <NA> to make an
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 54.81 60.89 <NA> <unk> interactive card for my mom before making my own mother 's day card i thought i would take a look
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 60.71 69.64 <NA> at the scratch website <unk> so over the last several years kids around the world ages eight and up have shared their projects 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 69.24 76.18 <NA> and i thought i wonder if of those three million projects whether anyone else has thought to put up mother 's day cards <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 75.84 79.82 <NA> so in the search box i typed in mother 's day
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 80.17 88.7 <NA> and i was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of mother 's day cards that showed up on the scratch website 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 88.21 93.89 <NA> many of them just in the past twenty four hours by procrastinators just like myself <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 93.85 96.53 <NA> so i started taking a look at them 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 97.09 99.92 <NA> i saw one of them that featured a kitten
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 100.27 103.92 <NA> and her mom and wishing her mom a happy mother 's day
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 106.13 111.39 <NA> and the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 112.55 122.67 <NA> another one was an interactive project where when you moved the mouse over the letters of happy mom day it reveals a special happy mother 's day slogan 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 123.59 124.87 <NA> music in
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 125.82 132.46 <NA> <unk> the creator told a narrative about how she had googled to find out when mother 's day was happening 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 133.62 141.94 <NA> typing and then once she found out when mother 's day was happening she delivered a special mother 's day greeting of how much she loved her mom
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 142.77 151.12 <NA> so i really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects in fact i liked it so much that instead of making my own project 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 151.12 154.49 <NA> i sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 155.29 167.69 <NA> and actually she reacted exactly the way that i hoped that she would she wrote back to me and she said i 'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother 's day cards for their mothers 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 168.1 173.9 <NA> so my mom was happy <unk> and that made me happy <unk> but actually
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 173.44 179.79 <NA> i was even happier for another reason i was happy because these kids were using

MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 182.87 191.47 <NA> as they created their interactive mother 's day cards <unk> you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies <unk>

MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 193.19 197.32 <NA> i mean that they were able to start expressing themselves
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 197.13 199.57 <NA> and to start expressing their ideas
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 200.7 210.25 <NA> <unk> when you become fluent with language <unk> it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 210 213.61 <NA> and it 's similar with new technologies
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 213.48 222.04 <NA> <unk> by writing be creating these interactive mother 's day cards these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 221.73 224.78 <NA> now maybe you won 't be so surprised by this <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 225.64 231.02 <NA> <unk> a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology i
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 230.89 235.31 <NA> mean all of us have heard young people referred to as digital natives

MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 242.32 252.14 <NA> when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies <unk> you often see them in situations like this <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 251.86 253.94 <NA> or like this <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 253.81 254.94 <NA> and there 's no doubt
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 255.14 259.49 <NA> <unk> that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 259.49 268.38 <NA> and chatting and texting and gaming but that doesn 't really make you fluent so
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 268.04 275.01 <NA> young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 275.22 281.26 <NA> <unk> a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 280.77 286.45 <NA> it 's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 286.23 290.72 <NA> and i 'm really interested in seeing how can we help young people become fluent
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 290.53 299.87 <NA> so they can write with new technologies and that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs or code
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 302.08 309.62 <NA> <unk> people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code you know in recent years there have been
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 309.43 315.92 <NA> hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 315.64 319.68 <NA> you look online you 'll see places like codecademy
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 319.47 324.81 <NA> and events like coderdojo and sites like girls who code <unk> or black
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 326.15 335.64 <NA> <unk> it seems that everybody is getting into the act you know just at the beginning of this year at the turn of the new year new york city mayor michael bloomberg
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 335.44 344.18 <NA> made a new year 's resolution that he was going to learn to code in two thousand and twelve a few months later the country of estonia decided that
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 344.18 353.95 <NA> all of its first graders should learn to code <unk> and that triggered a debate in the u k about whether all the children there should learn to code
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 354.81 361.16 <NA> <unk> now for some of you when you hear about this <unk> it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 361.16 365.8 <NA> when many people think of coding they think of it as something
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 365.43 374.84 <NA> that only a very narrow sub community of people are going to be doing and they think of coding looking like this <unk> and in fact if this is what coding is
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 375.37 381.5 <NA> <unk> it will only be a narrow sub community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 381.33 389.87 <NA> that can code <unk> but coding doesn 't have to be like this <unk> let me show you about what it 's like to code in scratch <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 389.56 399.69 <NA> so in scratch to code you just snap blocks together in this case you take a move block snap it into a stack and the stacks of blocks
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 399.51 404.94 <NA> control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story in this case controlling
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 404.96 406.05 <NA> <unk> big fish <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 405.82 408.25 <NA> after you 've created your program 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 408.07 410 <NA> you can click on share 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 410.01 417.63 <NA> and then share your project with other people so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 417.95 427.41 <NA> so of course making a fish game isn 't the only thing you can do with scratch of the millions of projects on the scratch website there 's everything from animated stories
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 426.92 429.67 <NA> to school science projects

MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 447.84 454.91 <NA> so i think there 's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this to be able to take
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 455.02 464.09 <NA> <unk> ideas and share their ideas with the world and it doesn 't just stay on the screen you can also code to interact with the physical world around you <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 464.11 471.11 <NA> here 's an example from hong kong where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 470.89 474.93 <NA> and had a light sensor so the light sensor detects the hole in the
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 475.7 482.83 <NA> <unk> so as they move the physical saw the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 482.59 488.47 <NA> and saws down the tree we 're going to continue to look at new ways of
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 488.29 497.79 <NA> bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us this is an example from a new version of scratch that we 'll be releasing
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 497.79 500.05 <NA> in the next few months and
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 501.51 508.09 <NA> <unk> be able to push you in new directions <unk> here 's an example it uses the webcam <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 509.67 513.31 <NA> and as i move my hand <unk> i can pop the balloons
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 514.11 516.43 <NA> or i can move the bug
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 517.92 522.88 <NA> so it 's a little bit like microsoft kinect where you interact with gestures in the world 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 522.87 529.61 <NA> but instead of just playing someone else 's game you get to create the games and if you see someone else 's game you can just say
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 529.84 531.2 <NA> <unk> inside and
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 530.83 539.3 <NA> you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it so there 's a new block that says how much video motion there is and then 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 538.84 543.38 <NA> if there 's so much video motion it will then tell the balloon to pop 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 543.91 546.9 <NA> the same way that this uses the camera
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 546.72 554.85 <NA> to get information into scratch <unk> you can also use the microphone <unk> here 's an example of a project using the
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 554.81 561.73 <NA> <unk> microphone <unk> so i 'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 594.99 600.05 <NA> <unk> kids are creating projects like this they 're learning to code <unk> but
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 600 607.29 <NA> <unk> even more importantly they 're coding to learn <unk> because as they learn to code <unk> it enables them
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 607.05 616.64 <NA> to learn many other things opens up many new opportunities for learning again it 's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 616.3 624.84 <NA> when you learn to read and write <unk> it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things <unk> when you learn to read you can then
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 626.69 636.18 <NA> <unk> the same thing with coding if you learn to code you can code to learn now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious you learn more about how computers work <unk>

MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 644.93 647.22 <NA> here 's another project 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 647.27 650.41 <NA> and i saw this when i was visiting
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 650.23 654.97 <NA> one of the computer clubhouses these are after school learning centers that we helped start

MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 671.66 674.86 <NA> and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 674.58 679.34 <NA> but also he wanted to do more he wanted to keep score
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 679.9 688.37 <NA> <unk> was a game where the big fish eats the little fish <unk> but he wanted to keep score <unk> so that each time the big fish eats the little fish 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 688.57 695.72 <NA> the score would go up and it would keep track and he didn 't know how to do that so i showed him 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 695.89 699.66 <NA> in scratch <unk> you can create something called a variable
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 700.88 702.6 <NA> <unk> call it score <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 703.97 708.23 <NA> and that creates some new blocks for you and also creates
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 708.04 713.73 <NA> a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score <unk> so each time i click on 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 713.45 719.8 <NA> change score it increments the score <unk> so i showed this to the clubhouse member
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 719.59 728.73 <NA> let 's call him victor and victor when he saw that this block would let him increment the score he knew exactly what to do he took the block
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 728.9 729.97 <NA> and he put
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 729.93 735.49 <NA> <unk> it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish <unk> 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 736.59 744.67 <NA> so then each time the big fish eats the little fish <unk> he will increment the score <unk> and the score
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 744.66 750.11 <NA> will go up by one <unk> and it 's in fact working and he saw

MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 755.44 762.56 <NA> and what went through my mind was how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables 
MitchResnick_2012X 1 MitchResnick_2012X 763.45 770.18 <NA> it doesn 't happen in most classrooms <unk> but that 's because in most classrooms when kids learn about variables
