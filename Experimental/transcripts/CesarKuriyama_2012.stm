CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 96.56 100.31 <NA> did and something that i realized early on in the project was that

CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 105.04 114.69 <NA> the day the first time that i forgot <unk> it really hurt me because it 's something that i really wanted to from the moment that i turned thirty i wanted to keep this project going until

CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 188.33 193.59 <NA> <unk> this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that i 've done 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 193.25 198.09 <NA> even just this one second allows me to remember everything else i did that one day <unk> 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 197.75 204.76 <NA> it 's difficult sometimes to pick that one second on a good day i 'll have maybe three or four seconds that i really
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 204.9 211.51 <NA> <unk> want to choose but i 'll just have to narrow it down to one <unk> but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 212.16 224.99 <NA> it 's also kind of a protest a personal protest <unk> against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert and they 're disturbing you they 're not even enjoying the show they 're watching the concert
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 227.14 234.68 <NA> <unk> i hate that i admittedly used to be that guy a little bit back in the day <unk> and i 've decided that the best way
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 234.19 237.5 <NA> for me to still capture and keep
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 237.04 249.84 <NA> a visual memory of my life and not be that person is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that memory of yeah that concert was amazing i really loved that concert and it just takes a quick 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 249.84 251.51 <NA> quick second 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 253.63 254.67 <NA> i was on a
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 255.07 262.65 <NA> three month road trip this summer it was something that i 've been dreaming about doing my whole life just driving around the u s and canada and
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 262.31 267.36 <NA> just figuring out where to go the next day and it was was kind of outstanding <unk> 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 267.35 274.96 <NA> i actually ran out <unk> i spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that i had to take my year off so i
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 275.73 279.58 <NA> <unk> i went to seattle and i spent some time with friends working on a really neat project
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 288.39 293.38 <NA> one of the reasons that i took my year off was to spend more time with my family and
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 292.89 301.54 <NA> this really tragic thing happened where my sister in law her intestine suddenly strangled one day <unk> and
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 301.47 304.91 <NA> we took her to the emergency room <unk> and she was
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 304.99 312.05 <NA> she was in really bad shape we almost almost lost her a couple of times and i was there with my brother every day <unk> 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 315.76 319.58 <NA> it helped me realize something else during this project is that
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 321.52 329.67 <NA> recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult <unk> it 's not we tend to take our cameras out when
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 330.46 338.88 <NA> awesome things or we 're oh yeah this party let me take a picture but we rarely do that when we 're having a bad day and something horrible is happening
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 338.39 345.99 <NA> <unk> and i found that it 's actually been very very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 346.46 351.69 <NA> it really helps you appreciate the good times <unk> it 's not always a good day <unk> so
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 351.95 353.56 <NA> when you have a bad one
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 354.96 360.19 <NA> <unk> it 's important to remember it just as much as it is important to remember the [ good ] days 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 369.89 374.77 <NA> now one of the things that i do is i don 't use any filters i don 't use anything to
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 382.02 388.16 <NA> i started a rule of first person perspective <unk> early on i think i had a couple of videos where you would
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 387.76 395.49 <NA> see me in it but i realized that wasn 't the way to go the way to really remember what i saw was to record it as i actually saw it
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 404.99 411.39 <NA> <unk> now a couple of things that i have in my head about this project are wouldn 't it be interesting if
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 411.08 418.68 <NA> thousands of people were doing this i turned thirty one last week which is there <unk> 
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 420.5 429.97 <NA> i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this i think everyone would have a different interpretation of it <unk> i think everyone would benefit from just having that one second
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 429.99 433.36 <NA> <unk> to remember every day <unk> personally i 'm tired of
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 433.36 441.67 <NA> forgetting and this is a really easy thing to do i mean we all have hd capable cameras in our pockets right now most people in this room i bet
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 441.18 449.81 <NA> and it 's something that 's <unk> i never want to forget another day that i 've ever lived and this is my way of doing that and it 'd be really interesting also to
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 450.73 454.73 <NA> <unk> if you could just type in on a website june eighteen <unk> two thousand and
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 454.36 460.37 <NA> eighteen and you would just see a stream of people 's lives on that particular day from all over the world and
CesarKuriyama_2012 1 CesarKuriyama_2012 459.88 467.85 <NA> i don 't know i think this project has a lot of possibilities and i encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day so you can never forget that
