SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 132.45 142.72 <NA> the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age and it 's one reason why i spent five years as a journalist trying to understand 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 142.26 148.03 <NA> why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 148.14 150.17 <NA> and i think there 's three main reasons
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 151.42 156.38 <NA> <unk> those three reasons add up to the fourth reason which is probably the biggest reason of all 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 155.92 159 <NA> the first reason is certainly scientific 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 159 171.48 <NA> this little parasite that causes malaria it 's probably one of the most complex and wily pathogens known to humankind <unk> it lives half its life inside the cold blooded mosquito and half its life inside
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 171.31 179.52 <NA> the warm blooded human these two environments are totally different <unk> but not only that they 're both utterly hostile
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 179.84 192.19 <NA> <unk> so the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off this little creature survives under siege like that <unk> but not only does it survive <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 192.19 197.88 <NA> it has thrived <unk> it has spread <unk> it has more ways to evade attack than we know 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 197.78 204.97 <NA> it 's a shape shifter for one thing just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly the malaria parasite transforms
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 204.93 208.78 <NA> <unk> itself like that seven times in its life cycle <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 209.13 216.19 <NA> and each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other they have totally different physiology <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 215.82 224.5 <NA> so say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite 's life cycle it might do nothing at all to any of the other stages 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 224.4 229.94 <NA> it can hide in our bodies undetected unbeknownst to us for days for weeks

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 233.35 241.28 <NA> so the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 240.94 249.93 <NA> only about twelve species of mosquitos carry most of the world 's malaria <unk> and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 250 255.72 <NA> specialize in so you might think then well why don 't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 255.71 261.45 <NA> right we could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 261.02 262.35 <NA> but
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 262.1 264.75 <NA> say you live in the tropics
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 264.29 267.84 <NA> and you walk outside your hut one day
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 267.84 274.87 <NA> and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt around your home or say your cow does or say your pig does <unk>

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 276.71 284.98 <NA> and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water that 's it you 've created the perfect malarial mosquito habitat that 's right outside your door 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 284.94 292.66 <NA> so it 's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects we kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 292.35 302.26 <NA> so there 's a huge scientific challenge but there 's a huge economic challenge too malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on earth and there 's a reason for that 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 301.92 304.25 <NA> if you 're poor you 're more likely to get malaria
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 305.02 313.37 <NA> <unk> you 're poor you 're more likely to live in rudimentary housing on marginal land that 's poorly drained these are places where mosquitos breed <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 313.21 317 <NA> you 're less likely to have door screens or window screens
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 316.6 325.49 <NA> <unk> you 're less likely to have electricity and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible so you 're outside more you 're getting bitten by mosquitos more 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 325.03 329.97 <NA> so poverty causes malaria but what we also know now is that malaria itself
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 330.31 331.98 <NA> causes poverty <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 331.49 340.59 <NA> for one thing it strikes hardest during harvest season so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields collecting their crops they 're home sick with a fever <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 340.91 348.76 <NA> but it also predisposes people to death from all other causes so this has happened historically we 've been able to
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 348.52 349.99 <NA> take malaria out of
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 350.61 356.39 <NA> <unk> everything else stays the same so we still have bad food bad water bad sanitation all the things that make people sick <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 356.39 362.02 <NA> but just if you take malaria out deaths from everything else go down 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 362.4 367.37 <NA> and the economist jeff sachs has actually quantified what this means for a society <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 367.37 375.05 <NA> what it means is if you have malaria in your society your economic growth is depressed by one point three percent
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 376.69 380.66 <NA> <unk> year after year after year just this one disease alone 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 380.2 387.57 <NA> so this poses a huge economic challenge <unk> because say you do come up with your great drug or your great vaccine how do you deliver it
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 387.24 389.95 <NA> in a place where there 's no roads 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 389.96 399.83 <NA> there 's no infrastructure there 's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold there 's no clinics there 's no clinicians to deliver these things where they 're needed <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 399.37 402.98 <NA> so there 's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 403.54 404.97 <NA> but along with the scientific
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 405.11 410.64 <NA> <unk> challenge and the economic challenge there 's also a cultural challenge and this is probably
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 410.42 414.27 <NA> the part about malaria that people don 't like to talk about 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 414.02 420.9 <NA> and it 's the paradox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 420.86 429.94 <NA> this has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again <unk> they ask people in malarious parts of the world what do you think about malaria and they don 't
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 429.93 437.89 <NA> <unk> say it 's a killer disease we 're scared of it they say malaria is a normal problem of life 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 438.63 445.18 <NA> and that was certainly my personal experience when i told my relatives in india that i was writing a book about malaria they kind of
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 444.69 451.7 <NA> looked at me like i told them i was writing a book about warts or something like why would you write about something so boring
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 454.93 462.8 <NA> <unk> perception really a child in malawi for example she might have twelve episodes of malaria before the age of two <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 463.24 470.54 <NA> but if she survives she 'll continue to get malaria throughout her life <unk> but she 's much less likely to die of it <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 470.53 475.29 <NA> and so in her lived experience malaria is something that comes and goes
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 476.24 485.06 <NA> <unk> and that 's actually true for most of the world 's malaria most of the world 's malaria comes and goes on its own it 's just there 's so much malaria
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 485.06 488.92 <NA> that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 488.47 491.13 <NA> add up to this big huge number 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 491.33 500.2 <NA> so i think people in malarious parts of the world must think of malaria the way those of us who live in the temperate world think of cold and flu <unk> right cold and flu have
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 500.34 502.57 <NA> <unk> huge burden on our societies

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 512.37 519.74 <NA> and so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria because if people think it 's normal
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 519.51 524.78 <NA> to have malaria <unk> then how do you get them to run to the doctor to
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 526.57 532.28 <NA> <unk> pick up their prescription to get it filled to take the drugs to put on the repellents to tuck in the bed nets

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 543.39 553.65 <NA> it 's economically challenging to deal with and it 's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least and that adds up to the biggest problem of all which of course is the political problem

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 563.48 568.39 <NA> most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 568.39 579.97 <NA> so the main attacks on malaria have come from outside of malarious societies from people who aren 't constrained by these rather paralyzing politics <unk> but this i think introduces a whole host of other
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 579.99 588.49 <NA> <unk> kinds of difficulties the first concerted attack against malaria started in the 1950s it was the brainchild of the u s state department <unk>

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 596.34 604.94 <NA> they understood the cultural challenge in fact their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria shouldn 't be asked to do anything at all everything should be
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 604.87 613.16 <NA> <unk> done to them and for them <unk> but they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge <unk> they had so much faith in their tools

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 615.97 623.58 <NA> and so when those tools started to fail <unk> and public opinion started to turn against those tools they had no scientific expertise
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 623.4 629.97 <NA> to figure out what to do the whole campaign crashed malaria resurged back but now it was even worse
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 630.05 634.03 <NA> <unk> than before because it was corralled into the hardest to reach places in the most
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 635.03 644.31 <NA> <unk> forms one who official at the time actually called that whole campaign one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 663.96 668.2 <NA> but now i think the dilemma is the cultural challenge 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 668.01 678.23 <NA> the centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net <unk> it 's treated with insecticides this thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions and

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 719.51 729.28 <NA> these are minor inconveniences <unk> but that 's not how people with malaria think of malaria so for them the calculus must be quite different
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 730.23 739.51 <NA> imagine for example if a bunch of well meaning kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said you know <unk> you people have a lot of cold and flu <unk>

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 755.89 763.22 <NA> and i wonder if that 's how people in the malarious world thought of those nets when they first received them indeed 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 762.97 771.02 <NA> we know from from studies that only twenty percent of the bed nets that were first distributed were actually used <unk> 
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 770.95 778.71 <NA> and even that 's probably an overestimate because the same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients oh did you use that net i gave you
SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 779.9 787.53 <NA> <unk> is like your aunt jane asking you oh did you use that vase i gave you for christmas <unk> so it 's probably an overestimate <unk> but

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 790.01 799.15 <NA> we can do more education we can try to convince these people to use the nets and that 's what happening now we 're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops

SoniaShah_2013G 1 SoniaShah_2013G 814.11 822.43 <NA> takes resources it takes infrastructure it takes all the things that that cheap easy to use bed net was not supposed to be
