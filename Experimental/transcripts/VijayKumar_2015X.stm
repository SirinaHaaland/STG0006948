VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 14.62 19.16 <NA> <unk> we build autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 20.23 27.32 <NA> unlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today this robot doesn 't have any gps on board <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 27.67 29.94 <NA> so without gps it 's hard for
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 29.9 33.06 <NA> <unk> robots like this to determine their position 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 33.74 42.75 <NA> this robot uses onboard sensors <unk> cameras and laser scanners to scan the environment it detects features from <unk>
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 42.65 53.98 <NA> <unk> the environment <unk> and it determines where it is relative to those features using a method of triangulation and then it can assemble all these features into a map like you see behind me <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 54.93 63.04 <NA> <unk> allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision free manner what i want to show you next
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 62.76 70.22 <NA> is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory where this robot was able to go for longer distances <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 70.22 74.78 <NA> so here you 'll see on the top right what the robot sees with the
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 75.64 86.01 <NA> <unk> the main screen and of course this is sped up by a factor of four on the main screen you 'll see the map that it 's building <unk> so this is a high resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 86.01 91.97 <NA> and in a minute you 'll see it enter our lab <unk> which is recognizable by the clutter that you see 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 91.87 96.53 <NA> but the main point i want to convey to you is that these robots are capable of building <unk>
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 97.86 100.05 <NA> at five centimeters resolution
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 100.58 106.35 <NA> <unk> allowing somebody who is outside the lab or outside the building to deploy these
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 105.89 115.17 <NA> without actually going inside and trying to infer what happens inside the building now there 's one problem with robots like this <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 115.1 120.3 <NA> the first problem is it 's pretty big because it 's big it 's heavy <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 120.14 127.14 <NA> and these robots consume about one hundred watts per pound <unk> and this makes for a very short mission life <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 127.52 129.97 <NA> the second problem is that these
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 130.02 135.32 <NA> <unk> robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive a laser scanner a camera
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 135.11 140.74 <NA> and the processors that drives up the cost of this robot 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 140.94 143.68 <NA> so we asked ourselves a question 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 143.64 153.83 <NA> what consumer product can you buy in an electronics store that is inexpensive that 's lightweight that has sensing onboard and computation
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 156.04 158.96 <NA> <unk> and we invented the flying phone 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 160.12 162.62 <NA> so this robot
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 162.25 166.77 <NA> uses a samsung galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 166.56 170.76 <NA> and all you need is an app that you can download from our app store <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 170.76 176.88 <NA> and you can see this robot reading the letters ted in this case <unk> looking at the corners of the
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 180.1 187.5 <NA> flying autonomously that joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy giuseppe can kill it 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 190.43 194.73 <NA> in addition to building these small robots 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 194.27 199.9 <NA> we also experiment with aggressive behaviors like you see here <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 202.56 210.74 <NA> <unk> traveling at two to three meters per second <unk> pitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction the main point is we can have
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 210.56 222.76 <NA> smaller robots that can go faster and then travel in these very unstructured environments <unk> and in this next video just like you see this bird an eagle <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 222.39 229 <NA> gracefully coordinating its wings its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 230.11 237.41 <NA> <unk> can go fishing too in this case this is a philly cheesesteak hoagie that it 's grabbing out of thin air so
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 239.32 248 <NA> you can see this robot going at about three meters per second <unk> which is faster than walking speed coordinating its arms its claws
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 247.66 252.65 <NA> and its flight with <unk> split second timing to achieve this maneuver 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 254.63 258.45 <NA> <unk> experiment i want to show you how the robot adapts its flight
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 258.5 265.65 <NA> to control its suspended payload <unk> whose length is actually larger than the width of the window <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 265.16 271.15 <NA> so in order to accomplish this it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 270.99 272.77 <NA> and swing the payload through
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 278.94 287.36 <NA> <unk> but of course we want to make these even smaller and we 're inspired in particular by honeybees <unk> so if you look at honeybees and this is a slowed down video 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 287.36 289.57 <NA> they 're so small 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 289.14 291.79 <NA> the inertia is so lightweight 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 292.8 295.63 <NA> that they don 't care they bounce off
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 295.14 304.3 <NA> my hand for example this is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior and smaller is better because along with the small size you get
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 303.87 304.97 <NA> lower inertia
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 304.66 307.52 <NA> <unk> inertia <unk> along with lower inertia 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 309.34 314.78 <NA> along with lower inertia you 're resistant to collisions <unk> and that makes you more robust
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 315.16 324.21 <NA> <unk> so just like these honeybees we build small robots and this particular one is only twenty five grams in weight it consumes only six watts of power <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 325 333.45 <NA> <unk> up to six meters per second <unk> so if i normalize that to its size it 's like a boeing seven hundred and eighty seven traveling ten times the speed of sound 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 335.48 337.05 <NA> and
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 337.64 340.59 <NA> i want to show you an example 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 340.4 350.08 <NA> this is probably the first planned mid air collision at one twentieth normal speed these are going at a relative speed of two meters per second <unk> and this illustrates
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 353.37 362.33 <NA> <unk> carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling but essentially the collision is absorbed and the and the robot responds to the collisions <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 362.33 371.93 <NA> and so small also means safe <unk> in my lab as we developed these robots we start off with these big robots and then now we 're down to these small robots 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 371.69 379.94 <NA> and if you plot a histogram of the number of band aids we 've ordered in the past that sort of tailed off now because these robots are really safe
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 379.96 387.86 <NA> <unk> the small size has some disadvantages <unk> and nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages <unk>
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 387.46 398 <NA> the basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups or swarms <unk> so similarly in our lab we try to create artificial robot swarms <unk> and this is quite challenging because <unk>
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 397.9 404.85 <NA> <unk> now you have to think about networks of robots and within each robot you have to think about the interplay of
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 404.81 408.21 <NA> <unk> sensing communication computation
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 407.84 413.85 <NA> and this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 413.63 421.17 <NA> so from nature we take away three organizing principles that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 421.13 429.55 <NA> the first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors <unk> they need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 429.96 438.34 <NA> <unk> so this video illustrates the basic idea you have four robots one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator literally
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 438.66 449.78 <NA> <unk> but because the robots interact with each other they sense their neighbors <unk> they essentially follow and here there 's a single person able to lead this network of followers <unk>
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 451.96 454.04 <NA> <unk> so again it 's not because
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 454.03 461.72 <NA> all the robots know where they 're supposed to go it 's because they 're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 466.99 473.03 <NA> laughter so the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 474.43 478.08 <NA> and this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 479.96 483.24 <NA> <unk> key idea is that
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 483.23 488.37 <NA> the robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 487.91 496.59 <NA> they 're asked to form a circular shape <unk> and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation or how many robots you pull out 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 496.46 502.92 <NA> each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor <unk> it 's aware of the fact that it needs to
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 502.64 504.82 <NA> to form the circular shape
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 504.95 510.94 <NA> but collaborating with its neighbors it forms the shape without central coordination 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 511.05 513.84 <NA> now if you put these ideas together <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 513.85 522.16 <NA> the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 521.7 525.34 <NA> and these shapes can be varying as a function of time <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 525.24 527.33 <NA> and you 'll see these
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 527.09 529.97 <NA> robots start from a circular formation
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 530.1 534.78 <NA> <unk> change into a rectangular formation stretch into a straight line back into an ellipse <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 534.78 542.09 <NA> and they do this with the same kind of <unk> split second coordination that you see in in natural swarms in nature <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 542.62 549.47 <NA> so why work with swarms <unk> let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 549.67 554.97 <NA> the first one has to do with agriculture which is probably the biggest problem that we 're facing
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 554.99 556.26 <NA> <unk> worldwide 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 556.28 565.83 <NA> as you well know one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished <unk> most of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 565.49 575.08 <NA> and the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving but our production system efficiency is actually declining <unk> and that 's mostly because of water shortage
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 575.04 577.17 <NA> <unk> crop diseases climate change
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 576.98 579.22 <NA> and a couple of other things <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 578.85 587.3 <NA> so what can robots do well we adopt an approach that 's called precision farming in the community and the basic idea is
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 587.14 589.88 <NA> that we fly aerial robots
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 589.66 598.39 <NA> through orchards <unk> and then we build precision models of individual plants <unk> so just like personalized medicine while you might imagine
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 597.93 600.05 <NA> wanting to treat every patient
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 601.33 604.86 <NA> <unk> what we 'd like to do is build models of individual plants
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 604.62 613.67 <NA> and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs the inputs in this case being water <unk> fertilizer and pesticide
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 614.08 616.29 <NA> <unk> here you 'll see
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 615.93 622.67 <NA> robots traveling through an apple orchard and in a minute you 'll see two of its companions doing the same thing on the left side
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 622.24 629.28 <NA> <unk> and what they 're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard <unk> within the map is a map of every plant in this orchard
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 630.56 640.89 <NA> let 's see what those maps look like in the next video you 'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot on the top left is essentially a standard color camera <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 643.09 650.02 <NA> is an infrared camera and on the bottom left is a thermal camera and on the main panel you
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 650.94 654.16 <NA> <unk> reconstruction of every tree in the orchard
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 653.82 657.19 <NA> as the sensors fly right past
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 657.02 658.63 <NA> the trees
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 659.19 664.06 <NA> armed with information like this we can do several things <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 663.75 673.88 <NA> the first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple count the number of fruits on every tree by doing this you tell the farmer
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 673.64 678.73 <NA> how many fruits she has in every tree and allow her to estimate the yield
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 678.51 679.97 <NA> in the orchard
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 680.01 683.42 <NA> <unk> optimizing the production chain downstream <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 683.14 689.63 <NA> the second thing we can do is take models of plants <unk> construct three dimensional reconstructions <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 689.46 692.24 <NA> and from that estimate the canopy size <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 692.24 699.87 <NA> and then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant and this is called the leaf area index <unk> so if you know this leaf area
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 700.28 708.9 <NA> <unk> you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant which again tells you how healthy each plant is 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 709.01 710.95 <NA> by combining
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 710.73 725.02 <NA> visual and infrared information we can also compute indices such as ndvi and in this particular case you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops this is easily discernible
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 726.99 731.84 <NA> <unk> not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 731.6 741.7 <NA> and then lastly one thing we 're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of <unk> chlorosis and this is an orange tree which is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 741.7 750.11 <NA> but robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem in this section of the orchard
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 751 756.98 <NA> <unk> systems like this can really help <unk> and we 're projecting yields
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 756.88 766.25 <NA> that can improve by about ten percent and more importantly decrease the amount of inputs such as water by twenty five percent by using aerial robot swarms <unk> 
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 766.72 773.27 <NA> lastly i want you to applaud the people who actually create the future yash <unk>
VijayKumar_2015X 1 VijayKumar_2015X 775.12 781.14 <NA> <unk> sikang liu and giuseppe <unk> loianno who are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw
