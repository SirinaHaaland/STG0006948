MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 13 18.26 <NA> <unk> so wouldn 't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 17.8 24.99 <NA> as we 're walking around being able to to point a phone at anything <unk> and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 25.97 32.31 <NA> <unk> and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of of knowledge and experiences and ideas well
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 31.94 37.74 <NA> traditionally that was seen as science fiction but now we 've moved to a world where actually this has become possible <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 37.74 44.43 <NA> so the best way of explaining it is to just show it what you can see over here is tamara who is holding my phone that 's now plugged in so
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 44 48.27 <NA> let me start with this what we have here is a painting of the great
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 47.87 54.97 <NA> poet rabbie burns <unk> and it 's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 54.51 60.95 <NA> <unk> technology you can see effectively what tamara 's seeing on the screen <unk> and when she points at this image something magical happens
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 79.75 82.64 <NA> <unk> no trickery here 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 82.24 91.82 <NA> there 's nothing done to this image <unk> and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 91.36 94.76 <NA> not only that but as i move the object around <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 94.45 96.36 <NA> it 's going to track it
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 96.12 99.86 <NA> and overlay that content seamlessly 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 100.67 108.21 <NA> <unk> the thing that 's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 108.68 111.33 <NA> now this has applications everywhere <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 110.93 117.96 <NA> whether in things like art in museums like you just saw or in the world of say advertising or print journalism <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 117.95 123.21 <NA> so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it 's printed and here is this morning 's newspaper 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 122.75 124.84 <NA> and we have some wimbledon news which is
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 126.15 131.14 <NA> <unk> now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin voice to the grass and it 's very important that
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 132.6 139.3 <NA> you adapt and you you have to be flexible you have to be willing to change direction at a split second 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 138.93 142.48 <NA> and she does all that she 's won this title mm 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 141.99 149.77 <NA> and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an aura and i 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 150.43 162.65 <NA> <unk> what 's great about this is it isn 't just a faster more convenient way to get information in the real world <unk> but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 162.34 170.78 <NA> so what i have here is a wireless router my american colleagues have told me i 've got to call it a router <unk> so that everyone hereunderstands 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 170.35 172.85 <NA> but nonetheless here is the device 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 173.95 175.02 <NA> so now what i
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 175 183.6 <NA> can do is rather than getting the instructions for the device online i can simply point at it the device is recognized <unk> and then voice 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 184.37 189.63 <NA> begin by plugging in the grey adsl cable then connect the power <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 189.89 196 <NA> finally the yellow ethernet cable <unk> congratulations you have now completed setup
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 204.93 208.23 <NA> <unk> in the <unk> u k by scientists at cambridge <unk> and
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 208.24 214.87 <NA> they work in our offices and i 've got a lovely picture of them here they couldn 't all be on stage but we 're going to bring their aura to the stage so here they are 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 219.87 224.06 <NA> they 're not very animated this was the fourth take i 'm told 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 228.43 242.64 <NA> <unk> as we 're talking about cambridge let 's now move on to technical advancements because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than less than twelve months ago the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 242.64 244.31 <NA> and that means that i can now take <unk>
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 245.35 250.16 <NA> <unk> 3d models and place them in the world around me so i have one over here 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 275.28 289.84 <NA> <unk> after the fun comes the more emotional side of what we do <unk> because effectively this technology allows you to see the world through someone 's eyes and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 289.41 299.63 <NA> what 's great about this is the tools to do this are free they 're open they 're available to everyone within our application <unk> and educators have really got on board with with the classrooms <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 299.58 304.82 <NA> <unk> so we have teachers who 've tagged up textbooks teachers who 've tagged up school classrooms and a great example of this
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 305.02 308.64 <NA> <unk> a school in the u k i have a picture here from a video <unk> and we 're now going to play it
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 345.47 349.96 <NA> <unk> it 's not magic it 's available for everyone to do <unk> and actually i 'm going to show you how easy it is to do
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 350 356.9 <NA> by doing one right now so as sort of i 'm told it 's called a stadium wave so we 're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three and go over to here 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 356.9 360.32 <NA> tamara are you recording <unk> okay <unk> so are you all ready <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 360.09 362.74 <NA> one two three <unk> go audience whooooooo mm 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 366 367.84 <NA> fellows are really good at that 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 369.57 375.43 <NA> okay <unk> now we 're going to switch back into the aurasma application <unk> and what tamara 's going to do is is tag
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 375.43 379.97 <NA> that video that we just took onto my my badge <unk> so that i can remember it forever
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 381.16 385.88 <NA> <unk> now we have lots of people who are doing this already
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 385.88 391.67 <NA> and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side on the emotional side we have people who 've done things like
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 391.48 394.94 <NA> send postcards and christmas cards back to their family
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 394.51 398.12 <NA> with with little messages on them we have people who have 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 398.12 404.97 <NA> for example taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine <unk> so that if you 're stuck and you want
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 404.93 407.82 <NA> <unk> find out more you can point and discover the information 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 408.05 411.07 <NA> we 're all very very familiar with the internet 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 410.89 417.64 <NA> in the last twenty years it 's really changed the way that we live and work and the way that we see the world <unk> 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 417.64 422.17 <NA> and what 's great is we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift <unk> because
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 421.98 429.7 <NA> now we can literally take the content that we share we discover <unk> and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 430.17 438.34 <NA> it 's completely free to download this application if you have a good wi fi connection or 3g this process is very very quick oh there we are we can save it now 
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 437.91 446.32 <NA> it 's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint <unk> and the great thing is if you 're a professional user <unk>
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 448.98 454.97 <NA> <unk> to what we 've just used to create this demonstration the only difference is that you 've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content
MattMills_2012G 1 MattMills_2012G 455.13 456.18 <NA> you now ready
