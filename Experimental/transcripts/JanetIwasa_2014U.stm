JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 12.97 22.1 <NA> <unk> take a look at this drawing can you tell what it is i 'm a molecular biologist by training <unk> and i 've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 21.7 25.05 <NA> they 're usually referred to as a model figure a drawing
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 25.04 32.65 <NA> <unk> that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs this particular drawing is of a process called
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 35.59 45.84 <NA> it 's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell <unk> 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 45.71 54.94 <NA> there 's a problem with this drawing though <unk> and it 's mainly in what it doesn 't show from lots of experiments from lots of different scientists we know a lot
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 54.93 63.01 <NA> <unk> about what these molecules look like how they move around in the cell <unk> and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 62.79 70.78 <NA> so in collaboration with a clathrin expert tomas <unk> kirchhausen we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 70.83 74.99 <NA> so we start outside of the cell now we 're looking inside clathrin are
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 79.99 90.91 <NA> <unk> through connections with a membrane clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble or a vesicle that 's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 90.92 104.37 <NA> proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle <unk> making it separate from the rest of the membrane and now clathrin is basically done with its job <unk> and so proteins are coming in now we 've covered them yellow and orange that are responsible for taking apart this
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 104.72 110.07 <NA> <unk> cage <unk> and so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 109.85 120.15 <NA> these processes are too small to be seen directly even with the best microscopes so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis <unk> 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 120.5 124.96 <NA> here 's another illustration <unk> and this is a drawing of how a researcher
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 125 135.94 <NA> <unk> might think that the hiv virus gets into and out of cells and again this is a vast oversimplification and doesn 't begin to show what we actually know about these processes 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 135.71 144.37 <NA> you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses <unk> 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 144.37 149.84 <NA> why <unk> because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 150.55 159.56 <NA> <unk> i spent months in hollywood learning 3d animation software and i spend months on each animation and that 's just time that most researchers can 't afford 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 159.49 171.14 <NA> the payoffs can be huge though molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy <unk> 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 170.8 174.96 <NA> and i 'm working on a new project now called the science of hiv where i 'll be
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 175 181.68 <NA> <unk> animating the entire life cycle of the hiv virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 181.68 189.91 <NA> the animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades data on what this virus looks like
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 189.7 192.87 <NA> how it 's able to infect cells in our body 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 192.62 196.56 <NA> and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 196.67 204.67 <NA> over the years i found that animations aren 't just useful for communicating an idea <unk> but they 're also really useful for exploring a
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 204.63 214.75 <NA> <unk> hypothesis biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study and with the data we have now that 's just not good enough anymore 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 214.59 222.92 <NA> the process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 222.92 229.79 <NA> one researcher i worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 230.17 237.23 <NA> <unk> directly to the animation that she and i worked on together <unk> and in this way animation can feed back into the research process 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 236.8 250.11 <NA> i believe that animation can change biology <unk> it can change the way that we communicate with one another how we explore our data and how we teach our students <unk> but for that change to happen we need more researchers creating animations
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 250.31 260.56 <NA> <unk> and toward that end i brought together a team of biologists animators and programmers to create a new free open source software we call it molecular
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 260.56 265.65 <NA> flipbook that 's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 279.78 284.03 <NA> <unk> anyone can view download and contribute their own animations <unk> 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 284.03 292.42 <NA> we 're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today <unk> 
JanetIwasa_2014U 1 JanetIwasa_2014U 291.93 301.16 <NA> we are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they 're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures <unk> thank you
