MelindaGates_2010X 1 MelindaGates_2010X 759.57 765.9 <NA> so if you look back to one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight there are about three hundred and fifty thousand cases of polio on the planet that year 
MelindaGates_2010X 1 MelindaGates_2010X 765.9 771.32 <NA> in two thousand and nine we 're down to one thousand six hundred cases well how did that happen

MelindaGates_2010X 1 MelindaGates_2010X 836.41 847.16 <NA> so what 's the endgame well on september 4th there was a huge mop up campaign which is what you do in polio they went out and where shriram lives they vaccinated two million people 
MelindaGates_2010X 1 MelindaGates_2010X 846.79 854.97 <NA> so in less than a month we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program <unk> and i 'm happy to say only one
