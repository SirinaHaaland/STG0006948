VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 544.5 553.37 <NA> the first is that we need to simplify the message that we 're using stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself 
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 553.18 554.82 <NA> we need to unpack
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 554.78 561.3 <NA> <unk> complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less trained individuals 
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 560.96 571.2 <NA> we need to deliver health care not in large institutions but close to people 's homes and we need to deliver health care using whoever is available and affordable in our local communities <unk> 
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 570.86 574.69 <NA> and importantly <unk> we need to reallocate the few specialists who are
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 581.04 585.13 <NA> <unk> task shifting is an idea with truly global significance 
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 584.64 593.27 <NA> because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries i think it has
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 592.88 596.81 <NA> a lot of significance for better resourced countries as well <unk> why is that 
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 596.81 604.88 <NA> well in part <unk> because health care in the developed world the health care costs in the [ developed ] world are rapidly spiraling out of control

VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 608.53 617.45 <NA> but equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it 's become very remote and removed from local communities 
VikramPatel_2012G 1 VikramPatel_2012G 617.5 625.26 <NA> for me <unk> what 's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting though isn 't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable
