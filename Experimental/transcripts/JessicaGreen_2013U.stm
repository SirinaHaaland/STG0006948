JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 57.36 68.14 <NA> and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch <unk> so for example when you touch a pencil microbial exchange happens <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 68.1 78.7 <NA> if we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 78.39 79.94 <NA> i get asked all
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 79.93 87.87 <NA> <unk> of the time from people is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems and i believe the answer is yes 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 87.87 93.02 <NA> i think we 're doing it right now <unk> but we 're doing it unconsciously <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 92.86 99.3 <NA> i 'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 99.13 100.29 <NA> that demonstrates
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 100.61 106.89 <NA> <unk> through both conscious and unconscious design we 're impacting these invisible worlds <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 106.7 117.95 <NA> this is the lillis business complex at the university of oregon <unk> and i worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over three hundred rooms in this building 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 117.95 125.38 <NA> we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building and to do this we sampled dust
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 125.97 133.03 <NA> <unk> from the dust we pulled out bacterial cells <unk> broke them open and compared their gene sequences 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 132.54 138.07 <NA> this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 137.76 149.75 <NA> this is a picture of tim <unk> who right when i snapped this picture reminded me he said jessica <unk> the last lab group i worked in i was doing fieldwork in the costa rican rainforest <unk> and things have changed
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 152.17 162.86 <NA> <unk> so i 'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices and we 're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that i 've been working on in partnership with autodesk <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 162.46 172.94 <NA> the way that you look at this data is first look around the outside of the circle you 'll see broad bacterial groups <unk> and if you look at the shape <unk>
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 172.84 179.97 <NA> <unk> of this pink lobe it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group so at twelve o 'clock you 'll see that offices have a lot
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 179.96 186.3 <NA> <unk> of alphaproteobacteria <unk> and at one o 'clock you 'll see that bacilli are relatively rare <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 186.98 196.2 <NA> let 's take a look at what 's going on in different space types in this building if you look inside the restrooms they all have really similar ecosystems <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 196.2 200.2 <NA> and if you were to look inside the classrooms those also have similar
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 201.45 208.03 <NA> <unk> but if you look across these space types you can see that they 're fundamentally different from one another <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 208.08 217.39 <NA> i like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest i told tim if you could just see the microbes it 's kind of like being in costa rica <unk> kind of 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 217.71 225.23 <NA> and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland this perspective is a really powerful
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 225 233.32 <NA> powerful one for designers because you can bring on principles of ecology and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 233.1 245.67 <NA> <unk> the way organisms move around we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air <unk> so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 245.67 254.97 <NA> mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable that the air flow and temperature is just right they do this using
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 254.96 260.7 <NA> <unk> principles of physics and chemistry <unk> but they could also be using biology 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 260.99 270.82 <NA> if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building you 'll see that they 're all very similar to one another <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 270.82 275.05 <NA> and if you compare this to the microbes in a different
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 275.01 278.98 <NA> <unk> air handling unit you 'll see that they 're fundamentally different <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 278.88 289.18 <NA> the rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago <unk> and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco engineers and they have the ability to structure <unk>
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 289.08 292.42 <NA> <unk> biomes in this building the way that they want to 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 293.49 305 <NA> another facet of how microbes get around is by people and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people or the sharing of ideas like in labs
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 304.69 306.52 <NA> <unk> labs and in offices <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 306.3 314.1 <NA> given that microbes travel around with people you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 313.92 323.74 <NA> and that is exactly what we found if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another they have very similar ecosystems but if you go to
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 323.74 329.88 <NA> an office that is a farther walking distance away the ecosystem is fundamentally
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 329.81 330.93 <NA> <unk> different <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 330.71 337.98 <NA> and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 337.98 341.23 <NA> it makes me think that it 's possible to
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 341.07 350.11 <NA> tackle really challenging problems like hospital acquired infections i believe this has got to be in part a building
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 353.37 361.5 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to tell you one more story about this building <unk> i am collaborating with charlie brown <unk> he 's an architect <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 361.28 371.56 <NA> and charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design when he met me and realized that it <unk>
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 371.46 379.97 <NA> <unk> was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 379.96 390.56 <NA> <unk> of this building he got really excited because it added a new dimension to what he did he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 390.1 402.95 <NA> he helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated <unk> so what i 'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 402.82 404.67 <NA> what you 're looking at is a
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 404.63 411 <NA> <unk> signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air and how they vary over time <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 410.72 425.26 <NA> next i 'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation a lot of buildings are operated this way probably where you work
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 425.37 435.41 <NA> <unk> and companies do this to save money on their energy bill what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday <unk> when we opened the vents up again 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 435.41 447.55 <NA> when you walked into those rooms they smelled really bad <unk> and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 447.39 454.94 <NA> contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 454.93 458.3 <NA> <unk> came in from the outside through louvers 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 457.81 468.81 <NA> in these rooms the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well and when charlie saw this he got really excited he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 468.63 475.17 <NA> because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 476.39 482.4 <NA> <unk> the examples that i just gave you are about architecture but they 're relevant to the design of anything <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 481.91 487.6 <NA> imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 487.12 490.68 <NA> or <unk> on a phone <unk> 
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 490.28 504.04 <NA> there 's a new microbe i just discovered it it 's called blis and it 's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath <unk> wouldn 't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones
JessicaGreen_2013U 1 JessicaGreen_2013U 506.31 513.65 <NA> a conscious approach to design i 'm calling it bioinformed design <unk> and i think it 's possible thank you
