NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 13.48 19.94 <NA> <unk> a video of some of the models i work with they 're all the perfect size and they don 't have an ounce of fat 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 20.56 24.33 <NA> did i mention they 're gorgeous <unk> and they 're scientific models
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 25.76 32.48 <NA> <unk> as you might have guessed i 'm a tissue engineer <unk> and this is a video of some of the beating heart that i 've engineered in the lab <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 32.49 37.69 <NA> and one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 37.45 43.56 <NA> but what i 'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 43.88 52.53 <NA> well <unk> let 's think about the drug screening process for a moment you go from drug formulation lab testing animal testing and then clinical trials which you might call human testing 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 52.53 54.16 <NA> before the drugs get to market
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 54.99 64.33 <NA> <unk> a lot of money a lot of time <unk> and sometimes even when a drug hits the market <unk> it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 64.53 68.71 <NA> and the later it fails the worse the consequences <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 69.03 73.45 <NA> it all boils down to two issues one humans are not rats <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 73.05 79.97 <NA> and two <unk> despite our incredible similarities to one another actually those tiny differences between you and i have huge
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 79.93 90.15 <NA> <unk> impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us so what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 90.15 92.51 <NA> but also reflect our diversity <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 93.52 96.47 <NA> let 's see how we can do it with tissue engineering 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 97.51 104.97 <NA> one of the key technologies that 's really important is what 's called induced pluripotent stem cells they were developed in japan pretty recently
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 105.56 112.59 <NA> okay induced pluripotent stem cells they 're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 112.1 119.73 <NA> we induce cells okay say skin cells <unk> by adding a few genes to them <unk> culturing them <unk> and then harvesting them <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 119.54 125.14 <NA> so they 're skin cells that can be tricked <unk> kind of like cellular amnesia <unk> into an embryonic state
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 125.46 133.75 <NA> <unk> so without the controversy that 's cool thing number one cool thing number two you can grow any type of tissue out of them <unk> brain heart liver you get the picture <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 133.38 139.85 <NA> but out of your cells <unk> so we can make a model of your heart your brain
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 139.52 140.92 <NA> on a chip <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 141.6 150.08 <NA> generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece <unk> and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 150.31 157.22 <NA> <unk> and this is a schematic of a bioreactor we 're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular scalable way 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 157.06 162.81 <NA> going forward imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 162.81 165.74 <NA> it would be like having a clinical trial on a chip <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 166.72 177.35 <NA> but another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells let 's say <unk> from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 176.86 178.11 <NA> we can actually use
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 180.14 188.5 <NA> <unk> models of those diseases in the lab here 's an example from kevin eggan 's lab at harvard he generated neurons
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 188.29 191.26 <NA> from these induced pluripotent stem cells
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 191.08 199.44 <NA> from patients who have lou gehrig 's disease and he differentiated them into neurons and what 's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 199.1 204.97 <NA> so with disease models like these we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 205.07 207.94 <NA> and maybe discover drugs even faster 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 208.32 219.18 <NA> this is another example of patient specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa <unk> this is a degeneration of the retina it 's a disease that runs in my family <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 219.18 222.55 <NA> and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 222.21 224.84 <NA> so some people think that these models sound well and
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 226.21 228.68 <NA> <unk> are these really as good as the rat 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 228.43 237.08 <NA> the rat is an entire organism after all with interacting networks of organs a drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 236.71 243.44 <NA> and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat <unk> don 't you miss all that with these tissue engineered models 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 243.94 246.95 <NA> well <unk> this is another trend in the field 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 246.46 254.97 <NA> by combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics the field is actually evolving towards just that a model of the entire ecosystem of the body <unk> complete with multiple
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 254.93 266.76 <NA> <unk> organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart these systems are really hard to build <unk> but we 're just starting to be able to get there <unk> and so 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 266.45 268.83 <NA> watch out <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 268.61 275.05 <NA> but that 's not even all of it because once a drug is approved tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 275.34 277.24 <NA> <unk> this is an example
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 276.9 280.66 <NA> that you might care about someday and i hope you never do <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 280.71 286.93 <NA> because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 286.53 292 <NA> wouldn 't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you 're going to take are going to work on your cancer 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 291.96 299.9 <NA> this is an example from karen burg 's lab where they 're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments <unk> 
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 299.9 304.97 <NA> and some of our colleagues at tufts are mixing models like these with tissue engineered bone to see
NinaTandon_2012G 1 NinaTandon_2012G 304.96 312.9 <NA> <unk> how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next and you can imagine those kinds of multi tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies
