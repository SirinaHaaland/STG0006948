 
 for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is something fake  
 is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks  
 that what 's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a for pain management for example if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someone 's perception of it  
 in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i 'm going to show you how it works this is a trick that 's been in every children 's magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies  
 i 'll do it for you and then i 'll explain it and then i 'll explain why i explained it ok so here is what happens the knife which you can examine my hand which you could examine  
 i 'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this i 'll get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i 'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here right  
 that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i 'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve and the object of this is quite simple  
 
 i 'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well  
 
 my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it 's held so tightly in place that i can shake it  
 and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ta da  
 
 so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very even though it 's a very simple trick methodologically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand  
 i say i 'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i 'm holding onto my wrist is because that 's actually the secret  
 of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index finger is just going to shift from where it is to a position  
 pointing out like this  
 nice one  
 someone who didn 't have a childhood is out there  
 
 so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shifts so we could talk about why this is deceptive why you don 't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mind and the way it processes information it doesn 't count one two three it groups them but that 's not really what this is about right and then i open my hand up obviously it 's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by  
 chicanery my index finger being there and then when i close my finger same thing as i move back  
 this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors thanks now  
 
 what does that have to do with the placebo effect well  
 
 i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open i 'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing  
 turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that 's like aspirin shaped it 's just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective  
 even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical they 're sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill what  
 
 that really flipped me out turns out though that that 's not even where it stops if you have capsules  
 they are more effective than tablets in any form a colored capsule that 's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills  
 i don 't remember the statistic now sorry but the point is  
 
 these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in placebo you 've go to the needle  
 right a syringe with some inert a couple ccs of some inert something and you inject this into a patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind it it 's so much stronger than the white pill it 's a really this graph well i 'll show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is  
 
 the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality it 's only your belief that makes it real  
 in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real  
 
 and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hat pin it 's very very sharp  
 and i 'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit ok  
 this is really my flesh this is not damian 's special grown flesh that 's my skin right there this is not a hollywood special effect i 'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side  
 if you 're queasy if you if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night and some people that i didn 't know and one woman almost passed out so i suggest if you if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next thirty in fact you know what i 'll do the first bad part behind it you 'll get to see you can look away too if you 'd like to  
 so here is what happens right here the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce  
 i 'm sorry man am i freaking you out ok and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this  
 
 now essentially we 're in the same position we were in with the knife trick  
 
 sort of  
 but you can 't count my fingers right now can you so let me show them to you that 's one two three four five yes  
 
 i know what people think when they see this they go well he 's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes  
 
 so let me give you a little peek  
 
 how 's that look out there pretty good  
 
 yeah i know  
 
 and the people in the back go okay i didn 't really see that people in the satellite room are like starting to move in now let me give you good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a hollywood special effect that 's my flesh  
 and i can twist that around i 'm sorry if you 're getting queasy look away don 't look at the thing  
 people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go well yeah that looks kind of neat in  
 some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be see there 's a hole there and a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding  
 let me work up some blood for you  
 
 yes there it is  
 
 normally now i would take the needle out i would clean off my arm and i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of  
 taking something fake and making it into something real i 'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage  
 
 i will be seeing you several times over the next few days i hope you 're looking forward to that thank you very much
