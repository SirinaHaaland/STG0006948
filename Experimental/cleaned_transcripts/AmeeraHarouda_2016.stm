  this is my first trip first time in life i 'm outside of the walls of gaza  i 'm so happy to be here
  to feel free to fly the sky  to touch the sky  
 but that didn 't happen  simply i live in gaza  there is no airport 
 all borders are closed on every side we live in one of the biggest
  prisons in the world the only thing i can do is just to look up to the sky  
 on some days  we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours  
 when it 's cold we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes  sometimes we make food too 
 my job in gaza is to arrange
  everything for journalists who come to my homeland
 to tell the stories about what 's going on in gaza 
 many mornings i had to go to the border area to collect a journalist if anything should happen to the journalist 
 or if the journalist decides to cover a story the government
 doesn 't want us to cover bad things could happen
 navigating through my country helping journalists  filmmakers  news crews 
 is my working life 
 i believe my success comes
 from building a relationship not only with journalists and the news crews  but also with the communities in the gaza strip 
 these communities who don 't want their stories
  be told  i never looked to them as stories or numbers  but like
 like me they are human beings  
 i have built up many relationships over ten years  and guess what this gives me the chance to
  in some certain situations  i feel as a woman  i have more power  
 many male journalists in my society they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country 
 that problem started when the gaza tunnel was being built 
 with the siege on gaza  tunnels brought people all the basic needs like food
  building material other stuff we needed  but not anymore  because the egyptian side flooded them up with water and they are not working anymore
 drugs were being smuggled  and many young people got addicted too 
 in the tradition of the palestinian society  it 's forbidden for men to enter the household
  male journalists get the story  but i did  
 i have a wonderful husband a wonderful husband who supports me
 despite all the criticism he gets from the society  he 's at home now with my two kids  and i have another one that 's
  when i 'm working i call him every two hours  and he knows if he doesn 't hear from me from me he should call my contact the one who gives me access to the story  
 which is the one who i trust 
 one of the times
  during the kidnapping of the british journalist alan johnston  i was asked by an american magazine
 to set up a meeting with the kidnappers in gaza  and i did the journalist covering the story and i
 were asked to meet outside of his hotel  they came  they picked us up in a black van with black windows
  masks on that day  
 and they drove us away  far away in the middle of a field  they took our cell phones
 and we did the interview with the kidnapper outside in that field  i was so scared that day  a day i will
  do what i do i do it because i believe if i didn 't a huge part of the story about gaza will be missing  
 there are some more stories i could tell you about my country  and not all of them are bad  
 i love my country  despite the terrible situation we live in
 siege poverty
  unemployment
 but there is life  there are people who are dreamers and amazing people full of energy  
 we have wonderful music and a great music school we have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes  
 and gaza is the only place in the arab world where muslims and christians
  live in strong brotherhood applause
 during the time of war the hardest part for me is leaving 
  the house early in the morning leaving my children i take a picture of them everyday
  being a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in gaza  
 but when i hear the sound of the shelling or the sound of the bombing i just head straight toward it because
 i want to be there first because these stories should be
  when my children were small
 and we heard the sound of the war 
 i used to tell them that they were fireworks now they are older  they understand  
 i do have terrible nightmares
 because of all that i witnessed during war times especially these
  i still remember a little girl  her name is hala  she 's the only survivor from her family 
 her picture will be with me forever  i will never forget her i 'm
 proud that i can stand here and be here today with you  
 i 'm proud that i can tell you stories
  sad and happy stories about my small corner of the world gaza  
 i 'm proud that i am the first female fixer working in gaza  and the funny thing is they call me mr rambo
 in gaza 
 i hope one day i will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women all other amazing women i know in
  my country  i hope that one day i can help other women in my country to be fixers like me  
 and of course sometimes  i feel i can 't do this work anymore  it 's just too much for me  but i remember these words 
 don 't limit your challenge but challenge your limit
  don 't allow others to stand in front of your dreams
