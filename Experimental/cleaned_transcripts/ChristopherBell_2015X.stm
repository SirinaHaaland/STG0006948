  i spend most of my time thinking about little girls  
 which is kind of a weird thing for a grown man in our society to say  
  but i do i spend most of my time thinking about little girls and i think it 's primarily because i have one 
 this one 's mine  and i think you would really like her she is smart and funny and kind to people and a good friend 
 but when i talk about my daughter the word i find myself saying most is athlete 
 my kid 's athletic  she is strong and
  state champion in shaolin kempo at nine years old she is already halfway to a black belt my daughter is athletic  
 now  when a man who is six feet two and two hundred and sixty five pounds stands in front of you and says his daughter is athletic you might think that 's a reflection of him  
 it is not 
 my wife in high school was a two time all state soccer player and a
  volleyball player and i played dungeons and dragons and that is why  
 although my daughter is an athlete she 's also a huge nerd which i love 
 she walks around our house in a cloak of flames that she made herself
  she sits on the iron throne 
 even though she has
  primarily because we are not the worst parents who ever lived  
 but she knows there 's someone called the mother of dragons and she calls herself that and she loves it 
 she 's a huge comic book fan  right now her favorite character is groot she loves groot  she adores the incredible hulk  
 but my daughter really at heart her thing is star wars my kid is a jedi  
  although some days she 's also a sith which is
 a choice that i can respect 
 but here 's the question that i have to ask  why is it that when my daughter dresses up whether it 's groot or the incredible hulk  whether
  kenobi or darth maul  why is every character she dresses up as a boy  and where are all the female superheroes
  and that is not actually the question because there 's plenty of female superheroes my question really is where is all the female superhero stuff 
 where are the costumes where are the toys  
 because
 every day when my daughter plays when she dresses up she 's learning stuff
 through a process that in my own line of work as a professor of media studies we refer to as public pedagogy that is it
  how societies are taught ideologies  it 's how you learned what it meant to be a man or a woman what it meant to behave yourself in public what it meant to be a patriot 
 and have good manners it 's all the constituent social relations that make us up as a people it
  what that means is that every single aspect of your human existence outside of your basic bodily functions is in some way touched by media 
 from the car that you drive to the food that you eat to the clothes that you wear to the way you construct your relationships to the very language you use to formulate thought
 all of that is in some way mediated  
 so the answer in our society to how do we learn what we know about other people and about the world is largely through media
 well there 's a wrinkle in that in that our society media don 't simply exist as information distribution technologies and devices  they also exist as corporate entities  
 and when the distribution of information is tied to financial gain there 's a problem
  ninety percent of american media were owned by fifty companies in any market fifty companies doing something is a lot of companies it 's a lot of different worldviews 
 in two thousand and fifteen that number has shrunk to six 
 six companies
 and the cbs corporation 
 these six companies produce nine out of every ten movies you watch nine out of every ten television shows nine out of every ten songs nine out of every ten books so my question 
  to you is if six companies control ninety percent of american media how much influence do you think they have over what you 're allowed to see every day  
  we spend a lot of time saying that media can 't tell us what to think and they can 't they 're terrible at that but that 's not their job media don 't tell us what to think 
 media tell us what to think about  
 they control the conversation  and in controlling the conversation they don 't have to get you to think what they want you to think they 'll just get you thinking about the things they want you to think about 
 and more importantly not thinking about things they don 't want you
  think about they control the conversation 
 how does this work in practice  let 's just take one of those companies we 'll do an easy one  let 's talk about the walt disney company for a second the reason why i always pick the walt disney company is this is there a single person in this room who has never seen a disney movie 
 look around  exactly
  i picked disney because they have what we call one hundred percent penetration in our society every
  single person has been exposed to disney so it 's an easy one for me to use since 
  disney has made most of its money selling princesses to girls it 's made a huge chunk of its money 
 unless of course the princess your daughter is interested in as my daughter is is this one 
 see in two thousand and twelve disney purchased lucasfilm for the sum of four billion dollars  and immediately they flooded
  the disney stores with han solo and obi wan kenobi with darth vader and luke skywalker and yoda and not princess leia 
 why  because this princess messes up the public pedagogy for these princesses  so disney did not put princess leia merchandise in the store and when people went to disney and said hey where 's all the princess leia stuff 
  we have no intention of putting princess leia merchandise in the store and fans were angry and they took to twitter with the hashtag
 and disney said wait that 's not what we meant what we meant was we don 't have any princess leia merchandise yet  but we will 
 and that was in two thousand and twelve  and it is two thousand and fifteen and if you go to the disney store as i recently have and look for princess leia merchandise do you know how many princess leia items there are in the disney store  
 zero  because disney has no intention of
  princess leia in the store and we shouldn 't be surprised because we found out that was their policy when they bought marvel in two thousand and nine for the sum of four 
  point five billion dollars  because when you make a lot of money selling princesses to girls you also kind of want to make money from boys and so what better to sell boys than superheroes
  so now disney had access to captain america and to thor the incredible hulk  and
 they had access even to a group of superheroes no one had ever even heard of that 's how good marvel was at selling superheroes  
 last year they released a film called guardians of the galaxy 
 it 's a film that absolutely should not work  nobody knew who they were except for comic book nerds like me 
 one of the characters is a talking tree one of the characters is an anthropomorphic raccoon it should not work
  and they made a killing off of guardians of the galaxy 
 this character here in the middle her name is gamora she 's played by zoe saldana  and she is strong and smart and fast and fights like a ninja  and she is played by a beautiful black woman and my daughter fell in love with her  
 so like any good nerd dad i went to buy my daughter  gamora stuff  and when i got to the store  i learned a very interesting thing if i wanted to buy her a
  well gamora 's not on it they probably should have marketed this as some of the guardians of the galaxy 
 and if i wanted to buy her a lunchbox  she wasn 't on it and if i wanted to buy her a t shirt she wasn 't on it and as a matter of fact  
 if i went to the store as i did and looked at the display you would find a small picture of gamora right here but if you look at
  of the actual merchandise on that shelf gamora is not on any of it now  i could have taken to twitter with the hashtag 
 like millions of fans did across the world but the truth was i wasn 't even really that surprised because i was there when disney had released the avengers 
 and just this year we got a new avengers movie
  was not one but two female superheroes  scarlet witch and black widow  and we were very excited  but here 's the real thing about this even though scarlett johansson who is
  one of the most popular actresses in america plays black widow and black widow is the star of not one not two  but five different marvel movies there
  a single piece of black widow merchandise available not one  and if you go to the disney store and look for a black widow costume what you will find is you will 
  find captain america and the incredible hulk you will find iron man and thor you will even find war machine who isn 't even really in the movie that long who you will not find is black widow  and i could have gone to twitter with the hashtag as many people did
  but i 'm tired of doing that 
 i 'm tired of having to do that all over the country right now there are kids playing with the cycle blast quinjet play set where captain america rides a motorcycle out 
  of a moving jet and it 's really awesome you know how awesome it is so awesome that when it happened in the movie 
  but she has been replaced with a male figure  and so
 what is this teaching us i mean over the next five years disney and
 warner bros and a bunch of movie studios are going to release over thirty  feature length
 films with comic book characters and of those thirty feature length films exactly two of them will have female solo leads
  females in the rest of these movies but they will be sidekicks they will be love interests they will be members of teams they will not be the main character  
 and if what we learn what we know about other people and about the world we learn through media  then these companies are teaching my daughter that even if she is strong and smart
  and fast and fights like a ninja all four of which are true of her it
  either be ignored like gamora or erased and replaced with a boy like black widow 
 and it 's not fair it 's not fair to her and it 's not fair to your sons and daughters either  
 but here 's the thing  
 i 'm raising a little girl  and she has a little tomboy in her which by the way is a terrible thing to call a girl  what that basically is saying is those traits that define you they 're not really yours they 're just on loan
  to you for a little while from boys  but
 do you know how much grief she 's going to take in her life for having a little tomboy in her  
 zero  
 none people will think it 's cute they 'll call her feisty  because in our society  adding so called male traits to girls is seen as an upgrade 
 seen as a bonus i 'm not raising a little boy 
 like mike 
 mike is a little boy
 he 's eleven years old and the thing that he loves most in the world is a show called my little pony friendship is magic 
 like millions of other children across america  now the show is marketed to girls ages five to nine but there are millions of boys and grown men who enjoy my little pony friendship is magic they have a
  guys who like ponies  i happen to be one of them  
 and what are mike and myself and millions of other boys and men learning in this feminine sissified world of my little pony 
 well  
 they 're learning to study hard and to work hard and to party hard and to look good and to feel good and to do good and heaven preserve us from teaching these
  boys  so the other kids in his neighborhood pick on mike and they beat him up and they make fun of him and at eleven years old mike goes home finds a belt  wraps 
  it around his neck and hangs himself from the top bunk of his bed because we have developed a society in which you would rather be dead as a boy than thought of as liking stuff for girls and that is not mike 's fault that is our
  fault  we have failed him  we have failed our children  and we have to do better for them  
 we have to stop making it so that the only female superheroes appear on shirts that are pink and cut for girls  
 we have to stop  and when i was
 putting this together people said to me well that 's never going to happen and i said oh really because just this year  target announced that they were going to stop gendering their toy aisles
 they were going to mix it up now  before we
 break our shoulders patting target on the back just this week they released a shirt in which one of the most iconic scenes in star wars a new hope where princess leia stands up to the dark lord of the sith 
 was released on a t shirt in which she 's mysteriously replaced by luke so let 's don 't pat ourselves on the back too much
  just this week also disney announced it was no longer going to gender its halloween costumes which i say thank you disney except the only costumes you make are of male superheroes so does it matter who you have wearing them 
 just this week mattel who makes barbie announced they 're going to release a line of dc superhero girls 
 and the funny thing is  they met with girls and asked them what they wanted to see in dolls and you can see they have calves
 and elbows that bend so
  can do superhero stuff  
 and please buy them  and don 't just buy them for your daughters buy them for your sons because it 's important that boys play with and as female superheroes 
 just as my daughter plays with and as male superheroes as a matter of fact what i would love is a world in which every person who goes to the store goes with a little flowchart in their head of whether or not they should buy this toy for
  a boy or a girl and it 's a real simple flowchart because it only has one question on it it says is this toy operated with your genitals 
 if the answer is yes  then that is not a toy for children 
 and if the answer is no  then it 's for boys and girls  it 's really simple because
  today is about the future of the future and in my future boys and girls are equally respected  equally valued and most importantly  equally represented
