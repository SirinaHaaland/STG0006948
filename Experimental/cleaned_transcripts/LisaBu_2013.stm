  i was trained to become a gymnast for two years in hunan china in the 1970s 
 when i was in the first grade the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes all expenses
  my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them 
 after surviving the cultural revolution they firmly believed there 's only one sure way to happiness a safe and well paid job 
 it is not important if i like the job or not 
 but my dream was to become
 a chinese opera singer
  that is me playing my imaginary piano an
 opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics  so i tried everything i could to go to opera school 
 i even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show  
 but no adults
 liked the idea 
 no adults believed i was serious only my friends supported me but they were kids just as powerless as i was 
 so at age fifteen
  i knew i was too old to be trained my dream would never come true i was afraid that for the rest of my life
 some second class happiness would be the best i could hope for but that 's so unfair  
 so i was determined to find another calling
  nobody around to teach me  fine  i turned to books 
 i satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians
  so which books did i read here first books banned in china of course 
 the good earth is about chinese peasant life that 's just not convenient for propaganda  got it the bible is
  that 's so different and better  than obey so it becomes my tool to climb out of this confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents 
 encountering a new culture also
  started my habit of comparative reading it offers many insights for example  i found this map out of place at first
 because this is what chinese students grew up with 
 it had never occurred to me china doesn 't have to be at the center of the world a map actually carries somebody 's view 
 comparative reading actually is nothing new
 it 's a standard practice in the academic world there are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature 
 compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic so i thought well if comparative reading works for research  why not do it in daily life too  
 so i started reading books in pairs so they can be about people
 for the christ the temptations are economic political and spiritual 
 for the buddha they are all psychological lust fear
 and social duty
 interesting  so if you know a foreign language  it 's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages
  translation i found there is much to gain for example  it 's through translation that i realized happiness in chinese literally means
  to connect with people of the past
 and the present  i know i shall never feel lonely or powerless again 
 having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered  
 i have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream its most important purpose
 is to get us in touch with where
  dreams come from where passion comes from where happiness comes from even a shattered dream can do that for you  
 so because of books i 'm here today  happy  living again with a purpose and a clarity most of the time  
 so may books be always with you
