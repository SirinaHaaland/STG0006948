  i was living in a tiny house behind someone else 's house in los angeles it was this guest house it had
  kind of been dilapidated not taken care of for a long time  and one night i was sitting there and i
 got this really spooky feeling kind of the feeling like you 're being watched  
 but no one was there except my two dogs and they were just chewing their feet 
  just my imagination  but the feeling just kept getting worse and
 i started to feel this
 this pressure in my chest  sort of like the feeling when you get bad news  but it started to sink lower and lower
 and almost hurt  and over the course of that week this feeling got worse and worse
  and i started to become convinced
 that something was there
 in my little guest house haunting me  
 and i started to hear these sounds 
 this whoosh kind of whisper like something passing through me 
  i don 't think you 're crazy  i think you just need to do a cleansing ritual
  get some sage and burn it and tell it to go away so i said ok and
 i went and i bought sage i had never done this before so i set the sage on fire  waved it about and said go away 
 this is my house  i live here you don
  but the feeling stayed nothing got better  and then i started to think ok well now this thing is probably just laughing at me  because
 it hasn 't left  and i probably just look like this impotent powerless thing that couldn 't get it to go away so
 every day i 'd come home and you guys this feeling got
  laughing at it now but i would i would sit there in bed and cry every night  and the feeling
 on my chest got worse and worse  it was was physically painful  and
 i even went to a psychiatrist and tried to get her to prescribe me medicine  and she wouldn 't just because i
  so finally i got on the internet  and i googled hauntings 
 and i came upon this forum of ghost hunters but these were a special kind of ghost hunters they were skeptics
 they believed that every case of ghosts that they had investigated so far had been explained away by science  and i was like
  this is what 's happening to me  and if you have an explanation for me  i would love to hear it and one of them said ok um 
 have you heard of carbon monoxide poisoning
  leak leaking into your home i looked it up and the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning
 include a pressure on your chest  auditory hallucinations whoosh
 and an unexplained feeling of dread  
  so that night i called the gas company i said i have an emergency i need you to come out i don 't want to get into the story now but i need you to come out 
 they came out i said i suspect a gas leak 
 they brought their carbon monoxide detector  
 and the man said it 's a really good thing that you called us tonight  because you could have been dead very soon
  haunted houses  and i wonder how many of them have been in one
 and how many of them have been in danger  
 so that haunting story has led me to my job  i 'm an investigator and i 'm an investigator in two senses i 'm an investigative
  and i 'm also an investigator of the claims of the paranormal and claims of the spiritual  and that means a few things
  sometimes that means that i 'm pretending to need an exorcism so i can get
 yes that 's right so i can go to an exorcist
 and see if he 's using gimmicks or psychological tricks to try to convince someone that they 're possessed 
 sometimes that means i 'm going undercover in a fringe group
 which i report on for a podcast that i
  i 've done over seventy investigations like this with my co host ross 
 i would love to tell you that nine times out of ten science wins saves the day it 's
 all explained that 's not true  the truth is 
 ten times out of ten science wins it saves the day
  mean there 's no such thing as a mystery of course there are mysteries  but a mystery is a mystery  it is not a ghost  
 now  i believe there are two kinds of truth
  me a while to get to this place  but i think this is right so hear me out i think there is outer truth and there 's inner truth  so
 if you say to me 
 there was a man named jesus and he once existed 
 that 's outer truth right  and we can go and look at the historical record we can determine whether that seems to be true  
 and i would argue  it does seem to be true
  i would say that 's an outer truth claim  because he physically rose or he didn 't i 'm not going to get into whether he rose or he didn 't 
 but i would say that 's an outer truth claim it happened or it didn 't happen
 but if you say i don 't care whether he rose from the dead it 's symbolically important to me  and that metaphor
  is so meaningful so purposeful to me  and i 'm not going to try to persuade you of it 
 now you 've moved it from outer truth to inner truth from science to art  and i think we have a tendency to not be clear about this to try to move our inner truths to outer truths 
 or to not be fair about it to each other and when people are telling us their inner truths to try to make them defend them by
  'm talking here about outer truth about objective things
 and there was an objective reality in my haunted house right  now that i 've told you about the gas leak  i doubt a single person here would be like i still think there was a ghost too 
 because as soon as we have these scientific explanations  we know to give up the ghost
  we use these things as 
 for things that we can 't explain we don 't believe them because of evidence  we believe them because of a lack of evidence
 so there is a group in los angeles
 called the independent investigations group or the iig and they do great work they 'll give
 a $ ten thousand prize to anyone who can show  under scientific
  that they have a paranormal ability no one 's done it yet  but
 they 've had a couple people who claim that they were clairaudients which means that they can hear voices either from the great beyond or they can read minds  
 and they had one person
 who was very sincere who believed that he could he could read minds  so they set up a test with him
  this is the way it always works the group says ok we have a protocol we have a way to scientifically test this do you agree with it the person says yes  then they test it it 's very important that both sides agree 
 they did that they tested him they said ok  you know what 
 you weren 't able to predict what lisa was thinking  
 it matched up about the same as chance looks like you don 't have the power and that gave them the opportunity to compassionately sit down with him and have
 a very difficult discussion which basically amounted to hey  
 we know you 're sincere  and what that means is 
 you do hear something in your head and that guy got to make the very difficult decision
  but really the 
  decision about whether to go get help we 're actually helping people
  these these connections that maybe before seemed like otherworldly explanations  help draw us into reality
 and maybe change our lives for the better  
 now on the other hand  maybe one time it 'll turn out to be true  
  respect them enough to ask these good questions challenge and see how you can examine them together  because there 's this idea that you can 't respect
  a belief and still challenge it but that 's not true  when we jiggle the lock when we test the claim we 're saying ok i respect you i 'm listening to what you 're saying i 'm going to test it out with you we 've all had that experience where you 're telling someone something and
 oh that 's really interesting yeah you know you 're being had but when someone says really huh 
 sounds a little sketchy to me 
 you at least know you 're being engaged and respected  and that 's the kind of attitude we should have with these claims that 's showing someone that you care what they 're saying
  most of these searches will come up
 empty  but that 's how all of science works every cure for cancer so far has not panned out  but we don 't stop looking 
 for two reasons because
 number one the answer matters whether it 's looking at the afterlife or the paranormal or the cure for cancer it all amounts to the same question
  how long will we be here
 and two  because looking for the truth 
 being open minded and being willing to be wrong and to change your whole worldview
 is
 i still get excited at ghost stories every single time i still consider that every group i join might be right and i hope i never lose that hope
 let 's all never lose that hope because searching for what 's out there
 helps us understand what 's in here  and also please have a carbon monoxide detector in your
