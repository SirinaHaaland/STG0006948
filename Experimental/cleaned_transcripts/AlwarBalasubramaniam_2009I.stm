  so many memories come back to me 
 it 's like after every exam when i walk out the teacher would say hey come how did you do
  i would say with a great smile i will definitely pass and i didn 't understand why in one hand they say speak the truth in the other hand when you say the truth they hated you  
 so it went on like that and i didn 't know where else to find myself  so i remember those nights i used to go to sleep with
 asking help from [ the ] unknown
 because for some reason i couldn 't believe what my father and mother hanged in the puja room as a god because my friend 's family
  had something else as a god  so  i thought i guess i 'll pray to [ the ] unknown and ask help and
 started getting help from everywhere each and every corner of my life at that time my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting 
 then when i was in eighth standard
  job in one of the signboard artists called putu and then
 school also started supporting me oh he 's bad at studies but let him send to the drawing competitions so
 it was good to survive with that little tool that i found to find my own place in school 
 and one of those competitions i just won a small little transistor philips radio and
  didn 't have the patience to wait until i reached home  
 so i just switched on in the train loudly if you travel in indian trains you can see people listening to radio and you know  
 even from their mobiles  so at that time  and i was thirteen and i was listening to
 just radio and someone happened to sit next to me like these three people are sitting here you know like
  college of arts i think you should
 study in a school of art you just quit school and come there 
 so  why i 'm telling you this you know maybe  you know  whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life it 's possible 
 it is that we need we need to be open and fine tuned 
 so that 's what made me
 ] college of arts after three attempts
 and just continue to inquire what i really want to do with art work or art
 and finally i 'm here in front of you when i look back you know  on what happened between that time and now
 here the last ten fifteen years i can see that most of the works
 revolve around three
  subjects  but it was not intentional  and i just start out with a trace because
 i was thinking what really makes us you know it 's actually [ the ] past what makes a person  so i was thinking but
 when you
 look at the past the way to understand the past is only by the traces available because we cannot go back [ to ] the past
  it can be ruins or it can be music  or it can be painting or drawing or writing whatever it is but it is just a
 kind of trace of that time and that fascinated me to explore that
 territory  so i was working on the
 line but instead of
 working about traces  i started capturing traces  so here are some of the works i would like to show you
 so
 this is called self in progress it 's just a trace of being in this body  
 so here what happened then you know what i really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a
 trace of myself  
 it 's almost like a 3d photograph  so there is an element of performance and there is an element of sculpture and there is an element of feeling one 's self  so close to one 's
  so it 's almost like fossils for the future  and then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces  
 so this is what i was talking about while molding  it 's such a great experience because we have freedom of like walking or moving my hand or 
 moving around in the space but the moment this becomes solid
  move even an inch because this is plaster of paris so the moment you pour it it 's like liquid but after twenty minutes it 's almost like a hard stone  
 so
 this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because  knowingly or unknowingly whatever we do you know we leave our traces here  so i just thought i 'm going to capture
  this is the trace of fire 
 this is the trace of sun  
 because when i was capturing traces you know this thought comes to me always 
 is it only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace or is there other ways to capture it 
 so this work is nothing but like because of the focal length of the
  what is on the other side  so
 i just put the paper on the focal length which was an etching print then i got the portrait of [ the ] sun from sunlight  
 this is called dawn to dawn what i did here i just put like ten feet [ of ] paper
 then put a coconut rope and just burnt it so it took about twenty four hours to get this line  
 so wherever the fire is eating the paper that 's what becomes the work
 detail
 even though we have traces when we try to understand them  
 the perception and context play a major role to understand it  so do we really understand what it is or are we trying to get
 what we think it
  then move towards questioning the perception because even though there are traces when you try to understand them you know you play a major role 
 so like let 's say even a simple act how many of you saw a cow crossing in india
 while you were coming from bangalore to mysore can you just raise the hand if you just ask an opinion of how
 everyone can interpret it like let 's say if a schoolteacher says  she 'll simply say to get to the other side why the cow was crossing the road
  the answer can be so different if potter said it he would say for the greater good 
 martin luther king would say i imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road  
 without having their motives called into question 
 imagine moses comes now  and he sees the same cow walking around the street he would definitely say
  god came down from heaven  and he said unto the cow ' thou shalt cross the road
 ' and cow crossed the road  and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow 
 freud would say the fact that you 're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity
  einstein  he would say whether the cow crossed the road  or the road moved underneath the cow depends on your frame of reference 
 or buddha if he saw the same cow  he would say asking this question denies your own nature
 and most of the time  we don 't see what it is it just all depends on one 's perception and
 context what is really context you know i could just show you this little piece of paper  because i always think meaning doesn 't really exist  
 the meaning of what we create in this world doesn 't exist  it 's just created by the mind if you look at this piece of paper
 this is the breadth and this is called length  this is how we 've been taught in school  
 but if you tear it in the middle
 now i didn 't touch this breadth but still the meaning of this changes  
 so what we conceive as a meaning is always not there it 's on the other side  
 even when we say dark light
  tall short all meaning it doesn 't exist in reality it 's just that being a human  the way we train to
 perceive the reality creates this meaning  so this work from this period is mostly like you know this is
 a work called light makes dark it 's just captured through from the lamp  so
  the lamp is not just giving a light it 's also giving a darkness so this is a work of art which is just
 trying to explore that 
 this is called limit out this shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch do we really see 
 this is an exact negative it 's about six inches deep in the wall  but
 it just appears like it 's coming out of the wall
 you know the wall
  almost like
 this is the first skin and this is the second and there 's a third and each creates a meaning and we 're just pulling the wall off the gallery  
 again inward out it 's a full figure cast from myself it 's about eight inches deep 
 when i was doing that i always wondered since i 've worked with creators and now you know i 've
 moved to questioning the perception
 whenever i see the bird flying in the sky  it just makes me feel like
 there anything behind are there any traces up there  which as a human we don 't see them is there any way to capture the thought
 into visual art  i couldn 't find it  but
 a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about
 seven months in the restroom when i was changing the air freshener
 that goes from solid substance to vapor  it 's called odonil  this is the work i made out of that material  
 the process to get to make the sculpture was interesting because i wrote to balsara who produces that air freshener called odonil  saying dear sir i am an artist this is my catalogue will you help me to make this sculpture 
  wrote back to me  then i thought i will go to the small scale industries facilitating unit and ask help so i told them i 'd like to start an air freshener company 
 they said of course  this is the fee for the project report and we will give you all the details and they gave  finally 
 i went back to them and said it 's not for starting the company it 's just to make my own work please come for the show 
 and they did
  devi art foundation in delhi 
 in india  nobody really talks about works of art they always talk about the appreciation of art you buy this for three thousand rupees it 'll become thirty thousand in two months  
 this is the craft that was going on but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate  
 and this was collected by anupam which is like finally in the end he will not have anything because
  so this is after a few weeks  
 this is after a few months  it 's just all about questioning the preconceptions so if someone says oh i see the portrait 
 it may not be the portrait after a few months  and if they say it 's solid  it will not be solid  it will evaporate  
 and if they say they don 't get it  that 's also not true  
  it 's in the air it 's in the same gallery or in the same museum so
 they inhaled it  but they are not aware of it 
 while i was doing that work 
 my mom and my dad they were looking at it and they said 
 why do you deal with negative subjects all the time and i was like what do you mean light makes dark
 and now evaporating self don 't you think it remained something about
  of course not for me i 'm thinking this is tucked in some small solid  but the moment it evaporates  it 's merged with the whole 
 but she said no still i don 't like it can you make something from nothing as a sculptor i said no mom it can 't be  because
 we can
 create a sculpture by gathering dust together  or we can break the sculpture and get the dust 
 but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe
 so i did this work for her  it 's called emerging angel this is the first day
 it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other 
 so the same sculpture after a few days  
 this is after fifteen twenty days 
  through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one 
 this gave me a greater faith that evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [ the ] invisible  
 so what you see now
 is called shadow foreshadow and what i 'd like to tell you
 is we don 't see shadow  and we don 't see light too  we see the source of the light  we see where it 's bouncing but we don 't see
  they exist you know that 's why the night sky we see the sky as dark  but it 's filled with light all the time  
 when it 's bounced on the moon we see it the same thing in the darkroom the little dust particle will
 again  reflect the light and we realize
 the existence of light  so we don 't see dark  we don 't see light  we don 't see gravity  we don 't see electricity
  i just started
 doing this work to inquire
 further about how to sculpt
 the space between this object
 and there because as a visual artist if i 'm seeing this and i 'm seeing that
 but how to sculpt this you
 if we sculpt this this has two reference points  the skin of this is also representing this and skin at the other end also represents the floor 
 i did this as
  experiment of casting the shadow so this is a corrugated box and its shadow  then the second one the moment you bring any
 invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence so that produced a shadow  then i thought okay let me sculpt that 
 then again that becomes an object again  throwing light
  then the third one  so what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow  
 and then again at that point there is no shadow i thought oh good work is finished 
 you can see the detail  
 this is called
  false wall which contains like one hundred and ten cubic feet  so that hole actually
 makes the air come out and go in 
 so where it 's happening we can see but what is happening will remain invisible only this is from the show called invisible at talwar gallery  this is called kaayam 
 detail  
 and what i 'd like to tell you
  our senses are so limited we cannot hear everything we cannot see everything we don 't feel i am touching the air but if the breeze is a little more faster then i can feel it  
 so all of our
 construction of reality is through these limited senses so
 my request was like is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign and to really get to the point we should
  move beyond you know go to the other side of the wall like illogic like are invisible  
 because when we see someone walks we see the footprint  but if we 're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints and the footprints are nothing but passing time
