  what was the most difficult job you ever did 
 was it working in the sun  was it working to provide food for a family or a community  
 was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property 
 was it working alone or working on a project that wasn 't guaranteed to succeed
 but that might improve human health or save a life was it working to build something  create something make a work of art  
 was it work for which you were never sure you were fully understood
 or appreciated  the people in our communities who do these jobs deserve our attention our love and our
  the only ones in our communities who do these difficult jobs 
 these jobs are also done by the plants the animals and the ecosystems on our planet  including the ecosystems i study the tropical coral reefs 
 coral reefs are farmers  they provide food  income and food security
 for hundreds of millions of people around the world coral reefs
  the structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves 
 and the biological systems that they house filter the water and make it safer for us to work and play 
 coral reefs
 are chemists  the molecules that we 're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important
 in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs  and coral reefs are artists  the structures that they build are some of the most beautiful things on planet earth  
 and this beauty is the
  foundation of the tourism industry in many countries
 with few or little other natural resources  
 so for all of these reasons all of these ecosystem services economists estimate the value of the world 's coral reefs in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year  
 and yet despite all that hard work being done for us and all that wealth that we gain  we have done almost everything we possibly could
  destroy that we have taken the fish out of the oceans and we have added in fertilizer  sewage  diseases  oil  pollution  sediments  
 we have trampled the reefs physically with our boats our fins our bulldozers and we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea  warmed the waters and made storms worse  
 and these would all be bad on
  but these threats magnify each other and compound one another and make each other worse i
 'll give you an example 
 where i live and work in curaao a tropical storm went by a few years ago  and on the eastern end of the island where the reefs are intact and thriving you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed  
 but in town where corals had died from overfishing from pollution  
 the tropical storm picked up the dead corals and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left this is a coral
  that i studied during my phd i got to know it quite well and after this storm took off half of its tissue 
 it became infested with algae the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died 
 this magnification of threats this compounding of factors
 is what jeremy jackson describes as the slippery slope to slime it 's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally
 bacteria and algae and slime  
 now this is the part of the talk where you may expect me to launch into my plea for us to all save the coral reefs  
 but i have a confession to make 
 that phrase drives me nuts  
 whether i see it in a tweet in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure that
  phrase bothers me because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades  
 and yet  almost everyone i meet  no matter how educated is not sure what a coral is
 or where they come from how would we get someone to care about the world 's coral reefs
 when it 's an abstract thing they can barely understand if they don 't understand what a coral
  is or where it comes from or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is why would we expect them to care about saving them 
 so let 's change that what is a coral and where does it come from 
 corals are born in a number of different ways but most often by mass spawning 
 all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year  releasing all the eggs they 've made that year into the water column packaged into bundles
  with sperm cells and those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart  
 and hopefully hopefully at the surface of the ocean they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals and that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef
 so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface when they 're fertilized they do what any other animal egg
  divides in half again and again and again taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year 
 at the end of all this cell division they turn into a swimming larva
 a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed  
 but with all of the sensory systems that we have  they can sense color and light 
 textures  chemicals  ph  they can even feel pressure waves  they can hear sound  
 and they use those talents to search
  the bottom of the reef
 for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives so imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old 
 they attach in the place they find most suitable they build a skeleton underneath themselves they build a mouth and tentacles and then they begin the the difficult work of building the world 's coral reefs  
 one coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again
  leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself and growing up toward the sun  
 given hundreds of years and many species what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases  covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals 
 now there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet  
  but these systems house
 millions and millions of other species  and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems and it 's where we 're finding our new medicines it 's how we find new sources of food 
 i 'm lucky enough to work on the island of curaao where we still have reefs that look like this but indeed much of the caribbean and much of our world
 is much more like
  scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world 's coral reefs  and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes  but in my research i 'm not interested in looking backward 
 my colleagues and i in curaao are interested in looking forward at what might be 
 and we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long
  sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway  and we 're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions
 that the adults couldn 't they may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet  so in 
  the research i do with my colleagues in curaao we try to figure out
 what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage what it 's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process i 'm going to show you three examples of the work we 've done
 to try to answer those questions 
 a few years ago we took a 3d printer and we made coral choice surveys different colors and different textures and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle 
 and we found that corals even without the biology
  still prefer white and pink  the colors of a healthy reef  and they prefer crevices and grooves and holes where they will be safe from being trampled or eaten by a predator  
 so we can use this knowledge we can go back and say we need to restore those factors that pink that white those crevices those hard surfaces in our conservation projects we can also use that knowledge if we 're going to put something underwater like a sea wall or a pier 
 we can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back
  toward those corals 
 now in addition to the surfaces  we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs 
 starting about six years ago i began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled and i tried those one by one by one 
 looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach and we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer
  that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlement and attachment process  
 so as we speak my colleagues in curaao are testing those bacteria to see if they 'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab 
 and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back underwater  
 now in addition to these tools we also try to uncover the mysteries of
  is one of my favorite corals and always has been
 the pillar coral i love it because it makes this ridiculous shape  because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy
 and because it 's rare  finding one of these on a reef is a treat 
 in fact it 's so rare that last year it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list  
 and this was in part because in over thirty years of research surveys scientists had never found
 a baby pillar coral we weren 't even sure if they could still reproduce or if they were still reproducing 
 so four years ago we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in curaao 
 we got some good tips from our colleagues in florida who had seen one in two thousand and seven one in two thousand and eight  and eventually we figured out when they
 and we caught it here 's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue about to release them into the seawater  and here 's a male on the right releasing sperm 
 we collected this  we got it back to the lab  we got it to fertilize and we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab  
 thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles and thanks to the ten years of practice we 've had
 we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process and settle and attach 
 and turn into metamorphosed corals  so this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw 
 and i have to say if you think baby pandas are cute this is cuter
  so we 're starting to figure out the secrets to this process the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them  
 and this is true all around the world scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos to get them to settle  maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low 
  temperatures so that we can preserve their genetic genetic diversity and work with them more often 
 so low tech we are limited by the space on our bench the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink
 in any given hour  
 now compare that to our other crises and our other areas of concern as a society  we have advanced medical technology
  we have defense technology  we have scientific technology we even have advanced technology for art  but our technology for conservation is
 behind  
 think back to the most difficult job you ever did 
 many of you would say it was being a parent my mother described being a parent as something that makes your life
 far more amazing and far more difficult than you could 've ever possibly imagined i 've been trying to help
  corals become parents for over ten years now 
 and watching the wonder of life has certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul  but i 've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents  
 the pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago  and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab and here you see one embryo dividing 
 alongside fourteen eggs that didn 't fertilize and will
  will blow up 
 they 'll be infected with bacteria they will explode and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo that has a chance 
 we don 't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong  and we don 't know if it was just this coral on this reef 
 always suffering from low fertility  
 whatever the cause  we have much more work to do
 before we can
  use baby corals to grow or fix or yes maybe save coral reefs  
 so never mind that they 're worth hundreds of billions of dollars coral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi  
 they 're providing us with art
 and food and medicine  and we almost took out an entire generation of corals  but a few made it
 anyway  despite our best efforts  
 and now it 's time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future their coral babies  
 thank you so much
