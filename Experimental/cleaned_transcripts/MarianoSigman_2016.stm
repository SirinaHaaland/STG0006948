  we have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient greeks dressed how they lived how they fought  but how did they think 
 one natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought
 our ability to imagine to be
  conscious to dream have always been the same  another possibility is that the social transformations that have shaped our culture
 may have also changed the structural columns of human thought  
 we may all have different opinions about this actually it 's a long standing philosophical debate  but is this question even amenable to science
  here i 'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient greek cities looked just based on a few bricks 
 that the writings of a culture
 are the archaeological records  the fossils of human thought  
 and in fact  doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient books of human culture julian jaynes came
  in the ' 70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis that only three thousand years ago humans were what today
 we would call schizophrenics and he made this claim based on the fact that the first humans described in these books
 behaved consistently in different traditions and in different places of the world as if they
 and obeying voices
 that they perceived as coming from the gods  or from the muses what today we would call hallucinations  
 and only then as time went on they began to recognize that they were the creators  
 the owners of these inner voices  
  the ability to think about their own thoughts  
 so jaynes 's theory is that consciousness at least in the way we perceive it today 
 where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence
 is a quite recent cultural development  
 and this theory is quite spectacular but it has an obvious problem which is that it 's built on just a few and very specific examples  so the question is whether the theory that
  introspection built up in human history only about three thousand years ago
 can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner 
 and the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious 
 it 's not like plato woke up one day and then he wrote hello i 'm plato and as of today i have a fully introspective consciousness
  this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem we need to find the emergence of a concept that 's never said  the word introspection
 does not appear a single time
 in the books we want to analyze  
 so our way to solve this is to build the space of words 
 this is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them
  indicative of how closely related they are 
 so for instance you want the words dog and cat to be very close together  but the words grapefruit and logarithm to be very far away  
 and this has to be true for any two words within the space  
 and there are different ways that we can construct the space of words one is just asking the experts a bit like we do with dictionaries  another possibility
 is following the simple assumption that when two words are related they tend to appear in the same sentences in the same paragraphs in the same documents 
 more often than would be expected just by pure chance  
 and this simple hypothesis 
 this simple method  with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex and high dimensional space  
 turns out to be quite
  effective 
 and just to give you a flavor of how well this works this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words 
 and you can see first that words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods so you get the fruits  the body parts the computer parts the scientific terms and so on 
 the algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy  so for instance you can see that the scientific terms
 break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms 
 and then there are very fine things for instance the word astronomy which seems a bit bizarre where it is is actually exactly where it should be 
 between what it is 
 an actual science  and between what it describes  the astronomical terms 
 and we could go on and on with this actually if you stare at this for a while and you just build random trajectories
 you will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry  
 and this is because in a way walking in this space is like walking in the mind  
 and the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection
  are just very far away  and so once we 've built the space  the question of the history of introspection  or of the history of any concept
 which before could seem abstract and somehow vague
  becomes concrete
 becomes amenable to quantitative science 
 all that we have to do is take the books we digitize them  and we take this stream of words as a trajectory
 and project them into the space  and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time
 circling closely to the concept of introspection  
 and with this we could analyze the history of introspection in the ancient greek tradition for which we have the best available written
  record so what we did is we took all the books we just ordered them by time
 for each book we take the words and we project them to the space  and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection and we just average that 
 and then we ask whether as time goes on
 and on these books get closer and closer and closer to the concept of introspection  and this is exactly what happens
  in the ancient greek tradition  
 so you can see that for the oldest books in the homeric tradition  there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection  but about four centuries before christ this starts ramping up very rapidly
 to an almost five fold increase of books getting closer and closer and closer to the concept of introspection
  and one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different independent tradition 
 so we just ran this same analysis on the judeo christian tradition  and we got virtually the same pattern  
 again you see a small increase for the oldest books in the old testament  and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the new testament  and then we get the peak of introspection in 
 the confessions of saint augustine about four centuries
 after christ  
 and this was very important 
 because saint augustine had been recognized by scholars  philologists historians as one of the founders of introspection  
 actually some believe him to be the father of modern psychology  
 so our algorithm which has the virtue
  of being objective  and of course of being extremely fast it just runs in a fraction of a second
 can capture some of the most important conclusions
 of this long tradition of investigation  
 and this is in a way one of the beauties of science  which is that now this idea can be translated
 and generalized to a whole lot of different domains  so in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness  maybe the most challenging question
  we can pose to ourselves
 is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness to put it more precisely whether the words we say today
 can tell us something of where our our minds will be
 in a few days in a few months or a few years from now 
 and in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate our respiration
  genes on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases 
 we can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak  we tweet we email we write 
 can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong
 with our minds  and with guillermo cecchi who has been my brother in this adventure we took on this task 
 and we did so
  so by analyzing the recorded speech of thirty four young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia  
 and so what we did is we measured speech at day one  and then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict within a window of almost three years 
 the future development of psychosis  
 but despite our hopes we got failure
  after failure there was just not enough information in semantics
 to predict the future organization of the mind it was good enough
 to distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group 
 a bit like we had done for the ancient texts  but not to predict the future onset of psychosis
  but then we realized
 that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying  but how they were saying it 
 more specifically it was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were  but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood to the other one  
 and so we came up with this measure which we termed semantic coherence 
 which essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic  within one semantic category
 and it turned out to be that for this group of thirty four people 
 the algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict with one hundred percent accuracy 
 who developed psychosis and who will not  
 and this was something that could not be achieved not even close with all the
  remember vividly while i was working on this i was sitting at my computer and i saw a bunch of tweets by polo
 polo had been my first student back in buenos aires and at the time he was living in new york  
 and there was something in this tweets i could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly
 but i got this strong hunch this strong intuition that something was going wrong
  so i picked up the phone and i called polo and in fact he was not feeling well  
 and this simple fact that reading in between the lines 
 i could sense  through words  his feelings was a simple but very effective way to help 
 what i tell you today
 is that we 're getting close to understanding
 how we can convert this intuition that we
  all have that we all share into an algorithm  
 and in doing so we may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health based on objective  quantitative
 and automated analysis
 of the words we write of the words we say
