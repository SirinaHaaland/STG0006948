  the founding members of the axis of evil comedy tour the other founding members included ahmed ahmed who is an
 egyptian american who actually had the idea to go to the middle east and try it out before we went out as a tour he went out solo and did it first 
 then there was aron kader who was the
  then there was me the 
 of the group  now  being iranian american presents its own set of problems as you know 
 those two countries aren 't getting along these days so it causes a lot of inner conflict you know like part of me likes me part of me hates me 
 part of me thinks i should have a nuclear program the other part thinks i can 't be trusted with one 
 these are dilemmas i have every day  but i was born in iran i 'm now an american
  citizen which means i have the american passport which means i can travel
 because if you only have the iranian passport you 're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms you know syria venezuela north korea 
 laughter so anyone who 's gotten their passport in america will tell you when you get it 
  but what 's interesting is i 've never had trouble in any western countries with my american passport even though it says born in iran no problems where i 've had problems is in some of the arab countries  i guess some of the arab countries aren 't getting along with iran
  so i was in kuwait recently doing a comedy show with some other american comedians they all went through then the border patrol saw my american passport ah ha american great 
 then he opened it up born in iran wait 
 laughter and he started asking me questions he said what is your father 's name
  i started freaking out because i don 't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into 
 thought the guy was going to come back and be like we 've been looking for you for two hundred years 
 your grandfather has a parking violation it 's way overdue  
 you owe us two billion dollars 
 but as you can see when i talk i speak with an american accent which you would think as
  actor i should be able to play any part good bad what have you but a lot of times in hollywood when casting directors find out you 're of middle eastern descent they go oh you 're iranian great can you say ' i will kill you in the name of allah ' i go 
 i could say that but what if i were to say ' hello i 'm your doctor
  i don 't mind playing bad guys i want to play a bad guy i want to rob a bank i want to rob a bank in a film but do it with a gun not with a bomb strapped around me right 
 because i imagine the director maz i think your character would rob the bank with a bomb around him
  why would i do that if i want the money why would i kill myself
 stand up good people everywhere all it takes in one person to mess it up like a couple months ago in times square in new york there was a pakistani muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb now i happened to be in times square that night doing a comedy show 
 and a few months before that there was a white american guy in austin texas who flew his airplane into the irs building  and i happened to be in austin that day
 doing a stand up comedy show
 middle eastern male when you show up around a lot of these activities 
 you start feeling guilty at one point 
 i was watching the news i 'm like am i involved in this crap 
 i didn 't get the memo what 's going on 
 but what was interesting
  the pakistani muslim guy see he gives a bad name to muslims and and middle easterners and pakistanis from all over the world and one thing that happened there was also the pakistani taliban took credit for that failed car bombing 
 my question is why would you take credit for a failed car bombing 
 we just want to say  
 we tried
  when the white guy flew his plane into the building i know all my middle eastern and muslim friends in the states were watching tv going please don 't be middle eastern don 't be hassan or hussein
  that 's not one of us but i kept watching the news in case they came back and were like before he did it he converted to islam damn it  why jack why 
 but the fact is i 've been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world and i did a lot of shows in the middle east i just did a 
 solo tour  i was in oman and i was in saudi
  i was in dubai and it 's great there 's good people everywhere and you learn great things about these places i encourage people always to go visit these places for example dubai cool place they 're obsessed with having 
  the biggest  tallest longest as we all know they have a mall there the dubai mall it is so big they have taxis in the mall
  going on even in dubai but you wouldn 't know by the prices like in the dubai mall they sell frozen yogurt by the gram it
 's like a drug deal  i was walking by the guy
  the other thing you learn when you travel in these countries in the middle east latin american south american countries a lot of times when they build stuff there 's no rules and regulations 
 for example i took my two year old son to the playground at the dubai mall  and i 've taken
  to playgrounds all over the united states and when you put your two year old on a slide in the united states they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide  
 not in the middle east 
 i put my two year old on the slide
  i try to do with my stand up is break stereotypes and i 've been guilty of stereotyping as well i was in dubai and there 's a lot of indians who work in dubai  and they don 't get paid that well and i got it in my head that all the indians must be workers  i forgot there 's obviously successful indians in dubai too i was doing a
  send a driver to pick you up i went down to the lobby and saw this indian guy i go he must be my driver since he 's standing there in a cheap suit thin mustache staring at me
  leave you with this i try with my stand up to break stereotypes present middle easterners and muslims in a positive light i hope that in the coming years  more film and television programs come out of hollywood  presenting us in a positive light  who knows maybe
  keep telling jokes hope you keep laughing have a good day thank
