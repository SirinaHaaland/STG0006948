  growing up 
 i didn 't always understand why my parents made me follow the rules that they did 
 like why did i really have to mow the lawn  why was homework really that important  why couldn 't i put jelly beans in my oatmeal 
 my childhood was abound with questions like this
  normal things about being a kid
 and realizing that sometimes  it was best to listen to my parents even when i didn 't exactly understand why and
 it 's not that they didn 't want me to think critically their parenting always sought to reconcile the tension between having my siblings and i understand the realities of the world 
 while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo
  as inevitable i came to realize that this in and of itself was a very purposeful form of education one
 of my favorite educators  brazilian author and scholar paulo freire  speaks quite explicitly
 about the need for education to be used as a tool for critical awakening
 and shared humanity in his most famous book pedagogy of the oppressed he states no one can be authentically human
 while he prevents others from being so
 've been thinking a lot about this lately this idea of humanity  and specifically who in this world is afforded the privilege
 of being perceived as fully human 
 over the course of the past several months 
 the world has watched as unarmed black men and women have had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante  
 these events and all that has transpired after them
 have brought me back to my own childhood
  and the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in america
 that growing up i didn 't always understand in the way that i do now i think of how hard it must have been how profoundly unfair it must have felt
 for them to feel like they had to strip away parts of my childhood
 just so that i could come home at night 
  think of how one night  when i was around twelve years old on an overnight field trip to another city 
 my friends and i bought super  soakers and turned the hotel parking lot into our own water filled battle zone 
 we hid behind cars  running through the darkness that lay between the streetlights boundless laughter ubiquitous across the pavement  
 but within ten minutes my father came outside  grabbed me by my forearm and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip  before i could
  say anything tell him how foolish he had made me look in front of my friends he derided me for being so naive  
 looked me in the eye  fear consuming his face  and said son i 'm sorry  
 but you can 't act the same as your white friends 
 you can 't pretend to shoot guns you can 't run around in the dark you can 't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
 know now how scared he must have been how easily i could have fallen into the empty of the night  that some man would mistake this water
 for a good reason to wash all of this away  
 these are the sorts of messages i 've been inundated with my entire life 
 always keep your hands where they can see them don 't move too quickly  take off your hood when the sun goes down my parents raised me and my siblings in an armor of advice
 an ocean of alarm bells so someone wouldn 't steal the breath from our lungs so that they wouldn 't make a memory of this skin so that we could be kids not casket or concrete and it 's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else it 's simply because they wanted to keep us alive 
 all of my black friends were raised with the same message the talk  given to us when we became old enough to be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground when people made our melanin synonymous with
  to be feared  but what does it do to a child
 to grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child 
 that the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath that you cannot simply be curious that you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake that someone 's implicit bias might be the reason you don 't wake up in the morning  
 but this cannot be what defines us because we have parents who raised us to understand that our bodies
  weren 't meant for the backside of a bullet  but for flying kites and jumping rope  and laughing until our stomachs burst we had teachers who taught us how to raise our hands in class  and not just to signal surrender 
 and that the only thing we should give up is the idea that we aren 't worthy of this world so when we say that black lives matter it 's not because others don 't it 's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear when so many things tell us we are not i want to live in a world
  where my son will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born where a toy in his hand isn 't mistaken for anything other than a toy and i refuse to accept that we can 't build this world into something 
  new some place where a child 's name doesn 't have to be written on a t shirt or a tombstone where the value of someone 's life isn 't determined by anything other than the fact that they had lungs
