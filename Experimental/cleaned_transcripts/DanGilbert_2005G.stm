  make decisions every day we want to know what the right thing is to do in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic 
 and surely if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times that would be a tremendous gift 
  out that in fact  the world was given this gift in 
 by a dutch polymath named daniel bernoulli and
 what i want to talk to you about today is what that gift is  
 and i also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn 't made a damn bit of difference  now  this is bernoulli 's gift  
 this is a direct quote  and if it looks like greek to you it 's because well  it 's greek
 but the simple english translation much less precise  but it captures the gist of what bernoulli had to say was this 
 the expected value of any of our actions that is the goodness that we can count on getting
 is the product of two simple things the odds that this action will allow us to gain something and the value of that gain to us 
 in a sense
  bernoulli was saying is if we can estimate and multiply these two things we will always know precisely how we should behave  now  this simple equation even for those of you who don 't like equations is something that you 're quite used to here 's an example  
 if i were to tell you let 's play a little coin toss game and i 'm going to flip a coin and if it comes up heads i 'm going to pay you ten dollars  
 but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing
  with me most of you would say sure i 'll take that bet because you know that the odds of you winning are one half the gain if you do is ten dollars that multiplies to five 
 and that 's more than i 'm charging you to play so the answer is yes this is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet  
  everyday life 
 people are horrible at estimating both of these things and that 's what i want to talk to you about today there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do 
 and those are errors in estimating the odds that they 're going to succeed and errors in estimating the value of their own success now 
  there are six sides to a die two sides to a coin fifty two cards in a deck you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads  
 but as it turns out this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life that 's why americans spend more i should say  lose more gambling than on
  other forms of entertainment combined  
 the reason is this isn 't how people do odds the way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs now the question i 'm going to put to you is whether you 
  think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in oxford and of course you all know that the answer is dogs and the way that you know that the answer is 
  dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you 've seen dogs and pigs on leashes it was very
  easy to remember seeing dogs not so easy to remember pigs and each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind then dogs on leashes are more probable 
 that 's not a bad rule of thumb  except when it is so for example here 's a word puzzle 
 are there more four letter english words with r in the third place or r in the first place 
 well you check memory
  very briefly make a quick scan and it 's awfully easy to say to yourself  ring rang rung  and very hard to say to yourself  pare  
 park  they come more slowly  but in fact there are many more words in the english language with r in the third than the first place  
 the reason words with r in the third place come slowly to your mind isn 't because they 're improbable unlikely or infrequent it 's because
 the mind recalls words by their first letter  you kind of shout out the sound s and the word comes it 's like the dictionary it 's hard to look things up by the third letter 
 so this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability how this idea could lead you astray  it 's not just puzzles though for example
  americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways these are estimates of number of deaths per year per two hundred million u s citizens 
 and these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado fireworks asthma drowning etc 
  tornadoes and fireworks two things are vastly underestimated dying by drowning and dying by asthma  why
  when was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was boy dies of asthma 
 it 's not interesting because it 's so common  
 it 's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we 've seen tornadoes devastating cities or some poor schmuck who 's blown his hands off with a firework on the fourth of july
  drownings and asthma deaths don 't get much coverage they don 't come quickly to mind and as a result we vastly underestimate them  indeed  this is kind of like the sesame street game of which 
  thing doesn 't belong and you 're right to say it 's the swimming pool that doesn 't belong because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that 's actually very dangerous the way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide
  slide the lottery is an excellent example of course an excellent test case of people 's ability to compute probabilities and economists
 forgive me for those of you who play the lottery but economists at least among themselves refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax because the odds of getting any payoff by 
  investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet which by the
  way doesn 't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything 
 why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery  well  there are many answers but one answer surely is we see a lot of winners  right when this couple wins the 
  lottery or ed mcmahon shows up at your door with this giant check how the hell do you cash things that size i don 't know  we see this on tv we read about it in the paper  when was the last time that you saw
 extensive interviews with everybody who lost  indeed  
 if we required that television stations run a 30 second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner 
 the one hundred million losers in the last lottery would require nine and a half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say
 and you saw loss after loss after loss and then at the end there 's thirty seconds of and i won 
 the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small look i can prove this to you here 's a little lottery 
 there 's ten tickets in this lottery  nine of them have been sold to these individuals  it costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and if you win you get twenty bucks is this a good bet  
 well bernoulli tells us it is the expected value of this lottery is two dollars
  is a lottery in which you should invest your money and most people say ok i 'll play now a slightly different version of this lottery  
 imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named leroy leroy has nine tickets there 's one left do you want it  
 most people won 't play this lottery now you can see the odds of winning haven 't changed  but it 's now fantastically easy to imagine who 's going to win it 's easy to see
  leroy getting the check 
 right you can 't say to yourself i 'm as likely to win as anybody because you 're not as likely to win as leroy 
 the fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play  even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds  
 now  estimating odds as difficult as it may seem is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate
  trying to say what something is worth how much we 'll enjoy it how much pleasure it will give us 
 i want to talk now about errors in value  how much is this big mac worth is it worth twenty five dollars  
 most of you have the intuition that it 's not you wouldn 't pay that for
 it but in fact to decide whether a big mac is worth twenty five dollars
 requires that you ask one and only one question which is what
  australia
 and realized that they 're not going to serve you any food but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the mcdonald 's bag and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat you think 
 i can 't do anything else with this twenty five dollars for sixteen hours i can 't even set it on fire they took my cigarette lighter  
 suddenly twenty five dollars for a big mac
  might be a good deal on the other hand if you 're visiting an underdeveloped country and twenty five dollars buys you a gourmet meal  it 's exorbitant for a big mac why were you all sure
 that the answer to the question was no before i 'd even told you anything about the context  because
 most of you compared the price of this big mac to the price you 're used to paying 
 rather than asking what else can i do with my money comparing this investment to other possible investments you compared to the past and this is a systematic error people make what you knew
  paid three dollars in the past twenty five is outrageous  this is an error and i can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads for example  
 this is of course one of the most delicious tricks in marketing is to say something used to be higher and suddenly it seems like a very good deal 
 when people are asked about these two different jobs
  a job where you 're getting a salary cut each year  and one in which you 're getting a salary increase people like the second job better than the first despite the fact they 're all told they make 
  much less money why because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period 
  here 's another nice example here 's a $ two thousand hawaiian vacation package it 's now on sale for one thousand six hundred assuming you wanted to go to hawaii would you buy this package most people say they would  
 here 's a slightly different story $ two thousand hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for seven hundred dollars so you decide to mull it over for a week 
 by the time you get to the ticket agency the best fares are gone the package now costs one thousand five hundred would you buy it most
  because it used to cost seven hundred and there 's no way i 'm paying one thousand five hundred for something that was seven hundred last week  
 this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal in other words a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal
  here 's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle
  imagine that you 're going to the theater  
 you 're on your way to the theater in your wallet you have a ticket for which you paid twenty dollars  you also have a 20 dollar bill 
 when you arrive at the theater you discover that somewhere along the way you 've lost the ticket would you spend your remaining money on replacing it  
 most people answer no 
 now  let 's just change one thing in this scenario you 're on your way to the theater and in
  when you arrive you discover you 've lost one of them would you spend your remaining twenty dollars on a ticket well of course i went to the theater to see the play  what does the loss of twenty dollars along the way have to do now  
 just in case you 're not getting it  here 's a schematic of what happened ok 
 along the way you lost something in both cases it was a piece of paper in one case it had a u s president on it in the other case
  what the hell difference should it make  the difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself i 'm not paying twice for the same thing you compare the cost of the play now forty dollars to the cost that it used to have twenty dollars and you say it 's a bad deal
 comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people 's attempts to assign value  
 but even when we compare with the possible instead of the past we
  still make certain kinds of mistakes and i 'm going to show you one or two of them 
 one of the things we know about comparison that when we compare one thing to the other it changes its value so in one thousand nine 
 this fellow george bush for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum didn 't seem like such a great guy suddenly we 're almost longing for him to return
  the comparison changes how we evaluate him  now  retailers knew this long before anybody else did of course and they use this wisdom to help you
 spare you the undue burden of money  and so a retailer if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine and you see them here for eight twenty seven and thirty three dollars what would you do 
  most people don 't want the most expensive they don 't want the least expensive so they will opt for the item in
  middle  if you 're a smart retailer then you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf because suddenly the $ thirty three wine doesn 't look as expensive 
 in comparison so i 'm telling you something you already knew  namely that comparison changes the value of things  here 's why that 's a problem  
  bottle of wine home  it won 't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to the comparisons we make when we are
 appraising value 
  we 're trying to estimate how much we 'll like things are not the same comparisons we 'll be making when we consume them 
 this problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions let me just give you an example  i have to show you something from my own
  lab so let me sneak this in these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now 
 they 're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them 
 for some of the subjects sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of godiva chocolates and for others is a can of spam
  these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they 're going to enjoy the potato chips namely those who are looking at spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty 
  those who are looking at godiva chocolate think they won 't be nearly so tasty of course what happens when they eat the potato chips  well look you didn 't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy 
  salty crispy delicious snacks what 's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience
  nonetheless their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience  
 you 've all experienced this yourself even if you 've never come into our lab to eat potato chips so here 's a question 
 you want to buy a car stereo the dealer near your house sells this particular stereo
 for two hundred dollars but if you drive across town you can get it for one hundred bucks so would you drive to
  get fifty percent off saving one hundred dollars  most people say they would they can 't imagine buying it for twice the price when with one trip across town they can get it for half off  
 now  
 let 's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo and the dealer near your house had it for thirty one thousand but if you drove across town you could get it for thirty thousand nine hundred
  zero three savings the one hundred dollars  most people say no i 'm going to schlep across town to save one hundred bucks on the purchase of a car this kind of thinking drives economists crazy and it should 
 because
 this one hundred dollars that you save hello doesn 't know where it came from it doesn 't know what you saved it on when you go to buy groceries with it it doesn 't go i 'm the money saved
 saved on the car stereo or i 'm the dumb money saved on the car  it 's money and if a drive across town is worth one hundred bucks it 's worth one hundred bucks no matter what you 're saving 
  it on people don 't think that way that 's why they don 't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking zero point one percent or zero point one five percent of their investment but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste now  
  because what you 're doing is you 're comparing the one hundred bucks
 to the purchase that you 're making but when you go to spend that money you won 't be making that comparison 
 you 've all had this experience  if you 're an american for example you 've probably traveled in france 
 and at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown and you thought oh my god 
 these people are so warm they 're so nice to me  i mean compared to all these people who hate me when i try
  to speak their language and hate me more when i don 't these people are just wonderful and so you tour france with them and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner and what do you find 
 compared to your regular friends they are boring and dull  
 right because in this new context  the comparison is very very different in fact you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for french citizenship now 
 you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo you go to the stereo store you see two sets of speakers these big
  monoliths  and these little sleek speakers and you play them and you go you know i do hear a difference the big ones sound a little better and so you buy them and you bring them home and you entirely violate the dcor of your house
 and the problem of course is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you 'll never make again  what are the odds that years later you 'll turn on the stereo and
  sounds so much better than those little ones which you can 't even remember hearing  
 the problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time 
 people have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time  
 and what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules 
 so let me give you one very easy problem a second very easy problem and then a third hard problem here 's the first easy problem  
 you can have
 sixty dollars now or fifty dollars now which would you prefer  
 this is what we call a one item iq test ok all of us i hope prefer more money and the reason is we believe more is better than less  
 here 's the second problem you can have sixty dollars today or sixty dollars in a month  which would you prefer  again an easy decision because we all know that now is better than later  
 what 's hard in our decision making is when these two
  rules conflict for example when you 're offered fifty dollars now or sixty dollars in a month this typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting but you have to be patient  
 what do we know what do people do in these kinds of situations well by and large people are enormously impatient  that is  they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification
  and wait until next month for the extra ten dollars  maybe that isn 't so remarkable but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away
 by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen  
 imagine that you can have fifty dollars in a year that 's twelve months or sixty dollars in thirteen
  what do we find now  people are gladly willing to wait as long as they 're waiting twelve they might as well wait thirteen 
 what makes this dynamic inconsistency happen comparison troubling comparison let me show you this is just a graph showing the results that i just suggested you would 
  show if i gave you time to respond which is people find that the subjective value of fifty is higher than the subjective value of sixty when they 'll be delivered in now or one month respectively a 30 day delay but they show the reverse pattern
 when you push the entire decision off into the future a year  
 now  why in the world do you get this pattern of results these guys can tell us  
 what you see here are two lads one of them larger than the other the fireman and the fiddler 
 they are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon and i want you to notice two things at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler
 no point  however  the difference between them seems to be getting smaller first it 's an inch in your view then it 's a 
  and then finally they go off the edge of the earth here are the results of what i just showed you  this is the subjective height the height you saw of these guys 
  at various points and i want you to see that two things are true one the farther away they are the smaller they look
 two the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler but watch what happens when we make some of them disappear  
 right 
 at a very close distance the fiddler looks taller than the fireman but at a far distance their normal their true relations are preserved as plato said  what space is to size time is to value 
 these are the results of the hard problem i gave you
 sixty now or fifty in a month and these are subjective values and what you can see is our two rules are preserved  people always think more is better than less sixty is always better than fifty 
 and they always think now is better than later the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side watch what happens when we drop some out 
  we have the tendency for people to go for fifty dollars now over waiting a month  but not if that decision is far in the future notice something interesting that this implies
 namely  
 that when people get to the future they will change their minds that is as that month twelve approaches you will say what was i thinking waiting an extra month for sixty dollars i 'll take the fifty dollars now  
  the question with which i 'd like to end is this if we 're so damn stupid how did we get to the moon because i could go on for about two hours with evidence of people 's inability to
 estimate odds and inability to estimate value  the answer to this question i think is an answer you 've already heard in some of the talks and i dare say you will hear again namely that
 our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living they were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups rarely met anybody
  who was terribly different from themselves had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today 
 bernoulli 's gift bernoulli 's little formula  
 allows us it tells us how we should think
 in a world for which nature never designed us  
  that explains why we are so bad at using it but it also explains why it is so terribly important
 that we become good fast we are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate
 in its hands  we have no significant predators we 're the masters of our physical environment the things that normally cause species to become extinct
 are no longer any threat to us the only thing the only thing
 that can destroy us and doom us
 our own decisions 
 if we 're not here in ten thousand years 
 it 's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young dutch fellow in one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight because we underestimated 
  the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present
  would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually
  to frighten us and is there some way that we could counteract that dan gilbert i actually was consulting recently with the department of homeland security which generally believes that
 american security dollars should go to making borders safer i tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people 's psychological reaction to a set of events 
 and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified rather than not rather than  but in addition to stopping the
  atrocities that we 're all concerned about surely the kinds of
 play that at least american media give to and forgive me but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents we already know 
 for example in the united states more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes because they were scared and driving on highways than were killed in nine eleven  
  plague that was going to kill fifteen thousand americans next year you might be alarmed if you didn 't find out it was the flu these are small scale accidents and we should be wondering whether they should get the 
  kind of play the kind of coverage that they do surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they 'll be hurt
  if australia disappears tomorrow terror is probably the right response that 's an awful large lot of very nice people 
 on the other hand
  when a bus blows up and thirty people are killed more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country is terror the right response ca what causes the bug
  drama of the event that it 's so spectacular is it the fact that it 's an intentional attack by quote  outsiders what is it dg 
 yes it 's a number of things and you hit on several of them first it 's a human agent trying to kill us it 's not a tree falling on us by accident 
 second these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again
  people are being killed for no reason instead of good reason as if there 's good reason but sometimes people think there are so there are a number of things that
  together make this seem like a fantastic event but let 's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read so there 's a large role here 
  played by the media who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can ca i mean
  go to israel  you know go to israel and a mall blows up and then everybody 's unhappy about it and an hour and a half later at least when i was there and i was one
 hundred and fifty feet from the mall when it blew up i went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on and as the israeli mother said she said we never let them win by stopping
 stopping weddings i mean this is a society that has learned and there are others too that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as
 upset by it
  say as those of us who have not had many terror attacks ca but is there a rational a rational fear that actually the reason we 're frightened about this is because we think that the big one is to come dg yes of course  so
  if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be there might be more and more buses of thirty people we would probably not be nearly so frightened i don 't want to say
 please i 'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying terrorism is fine and we
  be so distressed that 's not my point at all what i 'm saying is that  surely rationally our distress about things that happen about threats 
 should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and
 threats to come  
 i think in the case of terrorism it isn 't 
 and many of the things we 've heard about from our speakers today how many people do you know got up and said  poverty  i can 't believe what poverty is doing
  get up in the morning they don 't care about poverty it 's not making headlines it 's not making news it 's not flashy there are no guns going off i mean if you had to solve one of these problems chris which would you solve terrorism or poverty
 you know terrorists with a nuke are are really likely to come the latest i 've read seen thought is that it 's incredibly
 incredibly hard for them to do that if that turns out to be wrong we all look silly but 
 if that were true  still more people die from poverty ca we 've
 evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks
  because in the past in the ancient past  we just didn 't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth and so it made no sense for us as
 as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things people died so be it but if you got attacked that was something you could do something about and so we we evolved these responses is that what happened dg well you know the people who are
 most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary
  psychologists themselves  my guess is that there 's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past but rather if you 're looking for an evolutionary explanation you might say that
 most organisms are neo phobic that is they 're a little scared of stuff that 's new and different and there 's a good reason to be because old stuff didn 't eat you right any animal you see that you 've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you 've never seen before 
 so you know when a school bus is blown up and we 've never seen this before
  our general tendency is to orient towards that which that which is new and novel
 is activated i don 't think it 's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it
  flushing the money directly down the toilet which
  so would you drive to
