  as other speakers have said it 's a rather daunting experience a particularly daunting experience to be speaking in front of this audience 
 but unlike the other speakers i 'm not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe or the wonders of evolution  or the really clever innovative ways people are
 attacking the major inequalities in our world  or even the challenges of
 in the modern global economy my brief as you 've just heard is to tell you about statistics
 and to be more precise to tell you some exciting things about statistics and that
  than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me 
 laughter one of my senior colleagues told me when i was a youngster in this profession rather proudly that
  statisticians were people who liked figures but didn 't have the personality skills to become accountants laughter
 and there 's another in joke among statisticians and that 's how do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician 
 to which the answer is the extroverted statistician 's the one who looks at the other person 's shoes
  but i want to tell you something useful
 and here it is so concentrate now
 this evening there 's a reception in the university 's museum of natural history and it 's a wonderful setting as i hope you 'll find and a great icon to the best of
 the victorian tradition  it 's very unlikely in this special setting and this collection of people but you might just find yourself talking to
  you 're making it up
  and then one of two things will happen they 'll either discover their long lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them 
 or they 'll suddenly become parched and or hungry and often both and sprint off for a drink and some food  and you 'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to 
 it 's one of the challenges in our profession to try and
  explain what we do we 're not top on people 's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on and it 's something i 've never really found a good way of doing but
 my wife who was then my girlfriend managed it much better than i 've ever
 been able to many years ago when we first started going out she was working for the bbc in britain and i was at that stage 
 working in america i was coming back to visit her she told this to one of her colleagues 
 who said
  do sarah thought quite hard about the things i 'd explained and and she concentrated in those days on listening
 don 't tell her i said that and she was thinking about the work i did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics  so
  her colleague suddenly got much more interested than  than i had any right to expect and went on and said what does he model 
 well sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said genes 
 he models genes that is my first love and that 's what i 'll tell you a little bit about what i want to do more generally is
  you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world  and how we react to that and how well we do or don 't think about it  
 so you 've had a pretty easy time up till now a few laughs and all that kind of thing in the talks to date you 've got to think  and i 'm going to ask you some questions  so here 's the scene for the first question i 'm going to ask you can
 you imagine tossing a coin successively
 and for some reason which shall remain rather vague
 we 're interested in a particular pattern here 's one a head followed by a tail followed by a tail  so suppose we toss a coin repeatedly then the pattern 
  that we 've suddenly become fixated with happens here and you can count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten it happens after the 10th toss  so you might think there are more interesting
  things to do but humor me for the moment imagine this half of the audience each get out coins and they toss them until they first see the pattern 
 first time they do it maybe it happens after the 10th toss as here the second time maybe it 's after the fourth toss the next time after the 15th toss so you do that lots and lots of times and you average those numbers
 that 's what i want
 this side to think about the other half of the audience
 doesn 't like head tail tail they think for deep cultural reasons that 's boring and they 're much more interested in a different pattern head tail head so on this side you get out your coins
  and you toss and toss and toss and you count the number of times until the pattern head tail head appears and you average them  
 ok so on this side you 've got a number you 've done it lots of times so you get it accurately which is the average number of tosses until 
 on this side  you 've got a number the average number of tosses until 
 so here 's a deep mathematical fact if you 've got two numbers one of three things must be true either they 're the same
  or this one 's bigger than this one  or this one 's bigger than that one 
 so what 's going on here  
 so you 've all got to think about this and you 've all got to vote and we 're not moving on and i don 't want to end up in the two minute silence to give you more time to think about it until everyone 's expressed a view  
 ok  so what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see head tail head with the average
  number of tosses until we first see head tail tail 
 who thinks that a is true that on average it 'll take longer to see head tail head than head tail tail 
 who thinks that b is true that on average they 're the same 
 who thinks that c is true that on average it 'll take less time to see head tail head than head tail tail ok
 who hasn 't voted yet because that 's really naughty i said you had to 
  so most people think
 b is true and you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that  it 's not 
 a is true here 
 it takes longer on average in fact the average number of tosses till head tail head is ten and the average number of tosses until head tail tail is eight 
 how could that be 
 anything different about the two patterns
  you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses 
 you can 't do that with head tail tail that turns out to be important there are two ways of thinking about this i 'll give you
 one of them so imagine let 's suppose we 're doing it on this side remember you 're excited about
  and we get a head and you start sitting on the edge of your seat because something
 great and wonderful or awesome might be about to happen the
 next toss is a tail you get really excited the champagne 's on ice just next to you you 've got the glasses chilled to celebrate  you 're waiting with bated breath for the final toss and if it comes down a head  that 's great you 're done and you celebrate 
 if it 's a tail well rather disappointedly you put the glasses away and put the champagne back  and you keep tossing to wait for the next
  head to get excited  on this side there 's a different experience it 's the same for the first two parts of the sequence you 're a little bit excited with the first head you get
 rather more excited with the next tail  then you toss the coin if it 's a tail you crack open the champagne if
 it 's a head you 're disappointed but you 're still a third
  the way to your pattern again  
 and that 's an informal way of of presenting it that 's why there 's a difference 
 another way of thinking about it if we tossed a coin eight million times then we 'd expect a million head tail heads and a million 
  could occur in clumps so if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions and you can have some of them overlapping  the clumps will be further
  another way of getting
 the intuition  what 's the point i want to make it 's a very very simple example an easily stated question in probability which every you 're in good company everybody gets wrong
 this is my little diversion into my real passion which is genetics  there 's a connection between head tail heads and head tail tails in genetics and it 's the following
  when you toss a coin you get a sequence of heads and tails when you look at dna there 's a sequence of not two things heads and tails but four letters as gs cs and ts
 and there are little chemical scissors called restriction enzymes which cut dna whenever they see particular patterns  and they 're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology 
 and instead of asking the question how long until i see a head tail head you can ask how big will the chunks be when i use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees 
 for example how long will those chunks be that 's a rather trivial connection between
 probability and genetics  there 's a much deeper connection which i don 't have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science and we 'll hear some talks
 later in the conference specifically about that  but it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies 
 a key part of that has to do
  be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job rather more sophisticated than the head tail head story but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques  
 and i will give you two little snippets two examples of projects we 're involved in
 in my group in oxford both of which i think are rather exciting 
 you know about the human genome project that was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome 
 the natural thing to do after you
  done that and that 's what this project the international hapmap project which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries 
 think of the human genome project as learning what we 've got in common and the hapmap project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people 
 why do we care about that well there are lots of reasons the most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people
  susceptible to one disease type 2 diabetes for example and
 other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease or stroke or autism and so on that
 's one big project there 's a second big project recently funded by the wellcome trust in this country  involving very large studies thousands of individuals with each of eight different diseases
  and coronary heart disease bipolar disease and so on
 to try and understand the genetics to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases  
 why do we want to do that because we understand very little about most human diseases we don 't know what causes them 
 and if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics we 'll have a window on the way the disease works  and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on so
 that 's as i said the little diversion
  on my main love  back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty  here 's another quiz for you
 now suppose we 've got a test for a disease which isn 't infallible but it 's pretty good it gets it right  ninety nine percent of the time  
 and i take one of you or i take someone off the street  and i test them for the disease in question let 's suppose there 's a test for hiv the virus that causes aids
 and the test says
 the person has the disease  what 's the chance that they do the
 test gets it right ninety nine percent of the time  so a natural answer is ninety nine percent  who likes that answer  
 come on everyone 's got to get involved don 't think you don 't trust me anymore 
 well  you 're right to be a bit skeptical because that 's not the
  that 's what you might think it 's not the answer and it 's not because it 's only part of the story it actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is 
 so let me try and illustrate that here 's a little caricature of
 a million individuals  
 so let 's think about a disease that affects it 's pretty rare it affects one person in ten thousand  amongst these million individuals most of them are healthy
 and some of them will have the disease and in fact if this is the prevalence of the disease about one hundred will have the disease and the rest
 so now suppose we test them all 
 what happens well amongst the one hundred who do have the disease the test will get it right ninety nine percent of the time and ninety nine will test positive  
 amongst all these other people who don 't have the disease the test will get it right  ninety nine percent of the time it 'll only get it wrong one percent of the time  but there are so many of them
  enormous number of false positives put that another way
 of all of them who test positive so here they are the individuals involved less than one in one hundred
 actually have the disease  
 so even though we think the test is accurate  the important part of the story is there 's another bit of information we need 
 here 's the key intuition  what we have to
  once we know the test is positive is to weigh up the plausibility or the likelihood of two competing explanations 
 each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit 
 one explanation is that the person doesn 't have the disease that 's overwhelmingly likely if you pick someone at random
 but the test gets it wrong  which is unlikely the other explanation is that the person does have the disease that 's unlikely but the test
  gets it right which is likely and the number we end up with that number which is a little bit less than one in one hundred
 is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other each of them taken together is unlikely 
 here 's a more topical example of exactly the same thing those of you in britain
 will know about what 's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called sally
  who had two babies who died suddenly and initially it was thought that they died of what 's known informally as cot death and more formally as sudden infant death syndrome 
 for various reasons she was later charged with murder and at the trial her trial a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths  innocent deaths in a family like hers which was professional and
  at the time  later and fairly recently acquitted on appeal in fact on the second appeal
 and just to set it in context you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child and then two 
 if they 're innocent to be convicted of murdering them to be put through the stress of the trial convicted of murdering them and to spend time in a women 's prison where all the other prisoners think you killed your children is a
 really awful thing to happen to someone
  and it happened in large part here because the expert
 got the statistics horribly wrong  in two different ways so where did he get the one in seventy three million number 
 he looked at some research which said the chance of one cot death in a family like sally clark 's is about one in eight thousand five hundred 
  'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren 't changed 
 so that 's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence  it 's like saying if you toss a coin and get a head the first time that won 't affect the chance of getting a head the second time 
 so if you toss a coin twice the chance of getting a head twice
 are a half that 's the chance the first time times a half the chance a second time  
  assume that these
 events are independent when you multiply eight thousand five hundred together twice you get about  seventy three million 
 and none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way 
 unfortunately here and really regrettably
 first of all in a situation like this you 'd have to verify
 it empirically  and secondly it 's palpably false there are lots and lots of things that we don 't know about sudden infant deaths  
 it might well be
  that there are environmental factors that we 're not aware of and it 's pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we 're not aware of  
 so if a family suffers from one cot death you 'd put them in a high risk group they 've probably got these environmental risk factors and or genetic risk factors we don 't know about 
 and to argue then that the chance of a second death is as if you didn 't know that information
 is really silly it 's worse than silly it 's really bad science nonetheless
  that 's how it was presented and at trial nobody even argued it that 's the first problem the second problem is what does the number of one in seventy three million mean 
 so after sally clark was convicted you can imagine it made rather
 a splash in the press
 one of the journalists from from one of britain 's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said
  was the chance that she was innocent was one in seventy three million 
 that 's a logical error  it 's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test which is ninety nine percent accurate the chance of having the disease is ninety nine percent 
 in the disease example we had to
 bear in mind two
  one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not and the other one was the chance a priori that the person had the disease or not 
 it 's exactly the same in this context 
 there are two things involved two parts to the explanation we want to know how likely or relatively how likely two different explanations are 
 one of them is that sally clark was innocent
 which is a priori overwhelmingly likely
  most mothers don 't kill their children 
 and the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event not as unlikely as one in seventy three million but nonetheless rather unlikely  
 the other explanation is that she was guilty now we probably think a priori that 's unlikely and we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that 's unlikely because of the presumption of innocence  
 and then if she were trying to kill the children she succeeded 
 so the chance that she 's innocent isn 't one in  seventy three million we don 't know what it
  is  it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence 
 we know the children died what matters is how likely or unlikely 
 relative to each other the two explanations are and they 're both implausible 
 there 's a situation where
 errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences
  in fact there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician who have subsequently been released on appeal many cases were reviewed
  and it 's particularly topical because he 's currently facing a disrepute charge
 at britain 's
 general medical council  
 so just to conclude what are the take home messages from this well we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life
 it 's also true
 and although 
 you as a collective are very special in many ways you 're completely typical in not getting the examples i gave right  
 it 's very well documented that people get things wrong they make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty  
 we can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty
  that 's an issue in our everyday lives 
 as you 've heard from many of the talks statistics underpins an enormous amount of research in science in social science in medicine and indeed quite a lot of industry all of quality control which has had a major impact on industrial processing 
 is underpinned by statistics 
 it 's something we 're bad at doing at the very least we should recognize that and we tend not to to go back to the
  sally clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said  
 so if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury i know how to build bridges i 've built one down the road please drive your car home over it 
 they would have said well pediatricians don 't know how to build bridges that 's what engineers do 
 on the other hand he came out and effectively said  or implied i know how to reason with uncertainty
  that 's fine he 's an expert 
 so we need to understand where our competence is and isn 't 
 exactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of dna profiling  
 when scientists and lawyers and in some cases judges routinely misrepresented evidence
  usually one hopes innocently  but misrepresented evidence forensic scientists said the chance that this guy 's innocent is one in three million 
 even if you believe the number just like the
  to one that 's not what it meant  and there have been celebrated appeal cases in britain and elsewhere because of that
