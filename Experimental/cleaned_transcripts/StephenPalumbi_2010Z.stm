  it can be a very complicated thing the ocean and it can be a very complicated thing what human health is and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task  but what i 'm going to try to say 
  is that even in that complexity there 's some simple themes that i think if we understand 
  those simple themes aren 't really
 themes about the complex science of what 's going on but things that we all pretty well know and i 'm going to start with this one if momma ain 't happy ain 't nobody happy  
 we know that right we 've experienced that 
 and if we just take that and we build from there 
 then we can go to the next step  which is that if the ocean ain 't happy  ain 't nobody happy
  the theme of my talk and we 're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways this is a shot of cannery row in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two cannery row at the time 
 had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast  we piled enormous amounts of pollution
  fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead based paints black people working in these canneries could barely stay 
  there all day because of the smell but you know what they came out saying  they say you know what you smell you smell money 
  and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money we made the ocean unhappy we made people very unhappy  and we made them unhealthy 
 the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages and i want to call that pinch a minnow  hurt a whale 
 the pyramid of ocean life now when an ecologist looks at the ocean i have to tell you
 we look at the ocean in a very different
  way and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean
 because when an ecologist looks at the ocean we see all those interconnections we see the base of the food chain  the plankton the small things and we see how those
 animals are food to animals
 in the middle of the pyramid and on so up this diagram  and that flow that flow of life from the very base up to the very top is the flow
  that ecologists see and that 's what we 're trying to preserve when we say save the ocean heal the ocean it 's that pyramid
 now why does that matter for for human health because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn 't be there some very frightening things happen 
 pollutants some pollutants
  molecules like pcbs that can 't be broken down by our bodies and they go in the base of that pyramid  and they drift up they 're passed up that way on to predators and on to the top predators and in so doing they accumulate now
 to bring that home i thought i 'd invent a little game we don 't really have to play it we can just think about it here it 's the styrofoam and chocolate game imagine that when we got on
 this boat we were all given two styrofoam peanuts can 't do much with them
  in your pocket suppose the rules are every time you offer somebody a drink you give them the drink and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too 
 what 'll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here and they will accumulate in the drunkest stingiest people 
 there 's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into
  a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible styrofoam peanuts and that 's exactly what happens with pdbs in this food pyramid  they accumulate into the top of it now suppose instead of styrofoam peanuts we take these lovely little chocolates that we get
 and we had those instead well some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around and instead of accumulating  they will just pass into our
  our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they 're absorbed by us  and that 's the difference between a pcb and say something natural like an omega 3 something we want out of the marine food chain 
 pcbs accumulate  
 we have great examples of that unfortunately pcbs accumulate in dolphins in sarasota bay in texas in north carolina they get into the food chain the dolphins eat
  the fish that have pcbs from the plankton  and those pcbs being 
 accumulate in these dolphins 
 now a dolphin mother dolphin any dolphin there 's only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin  
 and what 's that in mother 's milk here 's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay
  males a huge load juveniles a huge load females after their first calf is already weaned a lower load those females they 're not trying to those females 
  are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother 's milk into their offspring 
 these mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant and most of them die  
 now the mother then can go and reproduce but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals the death of the first born calf 
 there 's another top predator in the
  it turns out that top predator of course is us  and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places this is whale meat that i photographed in a grocery store in tokyo or is it 
 in fact what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo and use it to genetically test the dna out of whale meat samples
 and identify what they really were and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat some of them were illegal whale
  meat by the way that 's another story 
 but some of them were not whale meat at all even though they were labeled whale meat they were dolphin meat some of them were dolphin liver some of them were dolphin blubber  and those dolphin parts had 
  a huge load of pcbs  dioxins and heavy metals  and that huge load was passing into the people that that
  this meat 
 it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world that 's a tragedy for those populations but it 's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don 't know that that 's toxic meat 
 we had these data a few years ago i remember sitting at my desk
 being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat and it was toxic it had
  times the toxic loads ever allowed by the epa and i remember there sitting at my my desk thinking 
 well i know this this this is a great scientific discovery but it was so awful 
 and for the very first time in my scientific career i broke scientific protocol  which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them  
 we sent a very polite letter to the minister of
  minister of health in japan and simply pointed out that
 this is an intolerable situation not for us but for the people of japan because mothers who may be
 breastfeeding who may have young children would be buying something that they thought was healthy  but it was really toxic 
 that led to a whole series of other campaigns in japan and i 'm really proud to say that
 at this point it 's very
  difficult to buy anything in japan that 's labeled incorrectly even though they 're still selling whale meat  which i believe they shouldn 't but
 at least it 's labeled correctly and you 're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead  
 it isn 't just there that this happens  but in a natural diet of some communities in the canadian arctic and in the united states and in the european arctic a natural
  diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of pcbs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women 
 these women have toxic breast milk 
 they cannot feed their offspring their children their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain in their part of the world 's ocean pyramid
  that means their immune systems are compromised it means that
 their children 's development can be compromised  and the world 's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women 
 not by changing the pyramid  but by changing what they particularly eat out of it we 've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem  
 that 's a good thing for this particular acute problem
  but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem there 's other ways of breaking the pyramid 
 the pyramid if we jam things in the bottom can get backed up like a sewer line that 's clogged  and if we jam nutrients sewage fertilizer in the base of that 
  food pyramid  it can back up all through it we end up with things we 've heard about before red tides for example  which are blooms of toxic algae
  oceans causing neurological damage  we can also see blooms of bacteria 
 blooms of viruses in the ocean these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria
 in the genus vibrio which includes the genus that has cholera in it how many people have seen a beach closed
  why does that happen it happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches often what jams us up is sewage  
 now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying closed because
 human sewage is so far over this park that you
  very often we wouldn 't tolerate that we wouldn 't tolerate our parks being
 swamped by human sewage  
 but beaches are closed a lot in our country  they 're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason and i believe we shouldn 't tolerate that either
 it 's not just a question of cleanliness it 's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease
  these vibrios these bacteria can actually infect people they can go into your skin and create skin infections this is a graph from noaa 's ocean and human health initiative showing the rise of the infections by vibrio
 in people over the last few years surfers for example know this incredibly  and if you can see on some surfing sites in fact not only do you see what
  the waves are like or what the weather 's like but on some surf rider sites you see a little flashing poo alert  
 that means that the beach might have great waves but it 's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them even after a great day of surfing this legacy 
  of an infection that might take a very long time to solve some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now  and that makes them even more difficult
  these same infections create harmful algal blooms those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals this is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come 
 out of these harmful algal blooms shellfish poisoning fish ciguatera diarrheic shellfish poisoning you don 't want to know about that neurotoxic shellfish poisoning paralytic shellfish poisoning 
 these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms  rita calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of
  cholera
 into human communities  brought there not by a normal human vector  
 but by a marine vector this copepod copepods are small crustaceans they 're a tiny fraction of an inch long  and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera 
  bacteria that then leads to human disease that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to
  increased
 concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn 't move these vectors of cholera
 around the world 
 so what do you do we have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked 
  and clogged what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow well there 's a bunch of things you could do
  you could call joe the plumber for example  and he could come in and and fix the flow  
 but in fact  if you look around the world  not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems there have been places where problems have been fixed where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around 
 monterey is one of those i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey
  bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two that 's the picture in two thousand and nine the picture is dramatically different 
 the canneries are gone the pollution has abated  but there 's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems they need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top
  pyramid in monterey right now because of the efforts of a lot of different people is functioning better than it 's ever functioned for the last one hundred
 and fifty years  it didn 't happen accidentally it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this on the left there julia platt the mayor of my little hometown in pacific grove
  years old became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean in one thousand nine hundred and thirty one she produced california 's first community based marine protected area  
 right next to the biggest polluting cannery because julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone the ocean needed a place to grow from 
 that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed and she wanted to
 provide that seed 
 other people like david packard and julie packard who were instrumental in producing the monterey bay aquarium to lock into people 's notion that the ocean and the
 health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be 
 that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift not only in the fortunes of monterey bay but other places around the world  
 well  i want to leave you with the thought that what we 're really
  trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid  and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life it 's an ocean planet  
 and we think of
 ourselves as a terrestrial species  but
 the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected  
 and it 's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves 
 thank you very much
