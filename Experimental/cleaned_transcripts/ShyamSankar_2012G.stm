 like to tell you about two games of chess 
 the first happened in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven in which garry kasparov a human lost to deep blue  a machine 
 to many this was the dawn of a new era one where man would be dominated by machine 
 but here we are twenty years on
 and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the ipad not hal  the second game was a freestyle chess tournament
 in two thousand and five in which man and machine could enter together as partners  rather than adversaries if they so chose 
 at first the results were predictable  even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop  
 the surprise came at the end  who won
  won not a grandmaster with a supercomputer but actually two american amateurs using three relatively weak laptops 
 their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters and the superior computational power of other adversaries
  this is an astonishing result  average men average machines beating the best man the best machine  
 and anyways isn 't it supposed to be man versus machine  instead it 's about cooperation and the right type of cooperation 
 we 've been paying a lot of attention to marvin minsky 's vision for artificial intelligence over the last fifty years 
 it 's a sexy vision for sure many have embraced it it 's become the dominant school of thought in computer
  but as we enter the era of big data of network systems of open platforms and embedded technology i
 'd like to suggest it 's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time 
 i 'm talking about j c r licklider 's human computer symbiosis  perhaps better termed intelligence augmentation i a 
 licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the
  vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs 
 note that word cooperate 
 licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it data from star trek but to take a human and make her more capable 
 humans are so amazing how we think
  our creativity iterative hypotheses all very difficult if possible at all for computers to do 
 licklider intuitively realized this contemplating humans setting the goals formulating the hypotheses  determining the criteria and performing the evaluation 
 of course in other ways humans are so limited we 're terrible at scale computation and volume 
 we require high end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing 
 licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making 
 silently without much
  fanfare this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess 
 protein folding a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe this is a world changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease 
 and for this task supercomputer field brute force simply isn 't enough  
 foldit  a game created by computer scientists illustrates the value of the approach
  amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein  
 allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues this approach beat supercomputers fifty percent of the time
 and tied thirty percent of the time  foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure
  a protease that had eluded determination for over ten years was solved was by three players in a matter of days  perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game 
 last year on the site of the twin towers the nine eleven memorial opened it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called meaningful adjacency it
 places the names next to each other based on their relationships to one another friends
  when you put it all together it 's quite a computational challenge three thousand five hundred victims one thousand eight hundred adjacency requests  the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics
 when first reported by the media  full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the new york city design firm local projects  
 the truth is a bit more nuanced while an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework humans used that framework to design the final result 
 so in this case a computer had evaluated millions of
  possible layouts  managed a complex relational system and kept track of a very large set of of measurements and variables  
 allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices 
 so the more you look around you the more you see licklider 's vision everywhere  whether it 's augmented reality in your iphone or gps in your car human computer symbiosis is making us more capable 
 so if you want to improve human computer symbiosis what can you do you can start by designing the human into the process
  instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem design the solution around what the human will do as well  
 when you do this you 'll quickly realize that you spent all of your time on the interface between man and machine  specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction 
 in fact this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall
  that 's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster 
 what kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction the better the process the less the friction 
 and minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable 
 or take another example big data  
 every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors your phone your credit card your computer the result is big data and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition  
 the major emphasis
  of most approaches to big data focus on how do i store this data how do i search this data how do i process this data 
 these are necessary but insufficient questions the imperative is not to figure out how to compute  but what to compute how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale  
 again we start by designing the human into the process  
 when paypal was first starting as
  their biggest challenge was not how do i send money back and forth online it was how do i do that without being defrauded by organized crime 
 why so challenging because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns they can 't learn to do that based on patterns they 've never seen before  
 and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience  brilliant people relentlessly resourceful  entrepreneurial spirit 
 and one huge and important difference purpose
  and so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure 
 there 's a whole class of problems like this  ones with adaptive adversaries  they rarely if ever present with a repeatable pattern that 's discernable to computers 
 instead there 's some inherent component of innovation or disruption and increasingly these problems are buried in big data 
 for example terrorism  terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances  and despite what you might see on tv these adaptations
 and the detection of them are fundamentally human 
 computers don 't detect novel patterns and new behaviors but humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses  searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them 
 osama bin laden was not caught by artificial intelligence he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnerships with various
  as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer there is no find terrorist 
 button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems the less effective data mining can be 
 instead people will have to look at data
 and search for insight and as licklider foresaw long ago  the key to great results here is the right type of
  and as kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface 
 now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources  identifying key relationships and putting them in one place something that 's been nearly impossible to do before 
 to some this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications 
 to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance that must be acknowledged and they can 't be swept aside even with the best
  of intents so let 's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human computer symbiosis have had in recent time 
 in october two thousand and seven u s and coalition forces raided an al qaeda safe house in the city of sinjar on the syrian border of iraq 
 they found a treasure trove of documents seven hundred biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families in the gulf
  levant and north africa to join al qaeda in iraq  
 these records were human resource forms the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization it turns out that al qaeda too is not without its bureaucracy 
 laughter they answered questions like who recruited you what 's your hometown what occupation do you seek in that last question a surprising insight was revealed
 the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom
 hugely important since between two thousand and three and two thousand and seven iraq had one thousand three hundred and eighty two suicide bombings a major source of instability  
 analyzing this data was hard the originals were sheets of paper in arabic that had to be scanned and translated the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans pdfs and tenacity alone 
 the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore
  non obvious hypotheses  and in fact insights emerged  twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from libya  fifty percent of those from a single town in libya  
 hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at three percent it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in al qaeda
 a senior cleric in the libyan islamic fighting group in march of two thousand and seven he gave a speech after which there was a surge in participation amongst libyan foreign fighters
  perhaps most clever of all though 
 and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border 
 these were networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit 
 for example they charged saudi foreign fighters substantially more than libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al qaeda
  the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would be jihadists 
 in january two thousand and ten a devastating seven point zero earthquake struck haiti  
 third deadliest earthquake of all time left one million people ten percent of the population homeless 
 one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started
  january and february are the dry months in haiti yet many of the camps had developed standing water 
 the only institution with detailed knowledge of haiti 's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake leadership inside 
 so the question is which camps are at risk how many people are in these camps what 's the timeline for flooding and given very limited resources and infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation 
 the data was incredibly disparate the u s army
  had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country there was data online from a two thousand and six environmental risk conference other geospatial data none of it integrated 
 the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need 
 the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial information  social media data and relief organization information
 to answer this question by implementing a superior process what was otherwise a task for
  man and machine
