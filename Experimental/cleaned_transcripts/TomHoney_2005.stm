  i am a vicar in the church of england  i 've been a priest in the church for twenty years  
 for most of that time  i 've been struggling
 and grappling with questions
 about the nature of god who is god
 and i 'm very aware that when you say the word god many people will turn off immediately 
 and most people both within
 and outside the organized church still have a picture of
 a celestial controller a rule maker a policeman in the sky who orders
  everything and causes everything to happen he will protect his own people and answer the prayers of the faithful 
 and in the worship of my church the most frequently used adjective about god
 is almighty but i have a problem with that i have become more and more uncomfortable
 with this perception of god over the years  do we really believe
 that god is the kind of male boss
 that we 've been presenting
 in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years of course there have been thinkers who have suggested
 different ways of looking at god
 the feminine nurturing side of divinity  suggesting that god expresses himself or herself
 through powerlessness  rather than power  acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by
  deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life
 as part of what is
 a universal and global search for meaning 
 these ideas are well known in liberal academic circles  but clergy like myself
 have been reluctant to air them for fear of creating tension
  division in our church communities for fear of upsetting the simple faith
 of more traditional believers  i have chosen not to rock the boat  
 then on december  26th last year just two months ago 
 that underwater earthquake
 triggered the tsunami
 and two weeks later  sunday morning 9th of january  i found myself standing in front of my congregation
 intelligent well meaning  mostly thoughtful christian people
 and i needed to express on their behalf our feelings
 and our questions  i had my own personal
  responses  but i also have a public role and something needed to be said 
 and this is what i said 
 shortly after the tsunami i read a newspaper article written by the archbishop of canterbury fine title
 about the tragedy in southern asia
  essence of what he said was this  
 the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories
 about how god let this happen he wrote if some religious genius did come up with an explanation
  of exactly why all these deaths made sense 
 would we feel happier  or safer  or more confident in god 
 if the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers  holding the hand of his dead child
 was standing in front of us now there are no words that we could say to him 
 a verbal response would not be appropriate  the only appropriate
  response would be
 a compassionate silence
 and some kind of practical help 
 it isn 't a time for explanation or preaching  or theology it 's a time for tears 
 this is true  and yet
  from events that happened a long way away  
 but with our faith bruised  and we want an explanation from god  we demand
 an explanation from god 
 some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain 
 in some way god must feel the anguish and
  grief and physical pain that we feel in some way the eternal god
 must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within 
 and if this is true it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit as well
 we want a god who can weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice 
 this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re statement
 of christian belief about god 
 for hundreds of years  the prevailing orthodoxy the accepted truth was that god the father
 the creator is unchanging
 and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness 
 now the unchanging god feels a bit cold and indifferent to me 
 and the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question
  the cold unfeeling god the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps
 have caused people to ask where is god in all this who is god in all this 
 and the answer was god is in this with us  
 or god doesn 't deserve our allegiance anymore 
 if god is a bystander  observing but not involved
 then god may well exist but we don 't want to know about him  
 many jews and christians now feel like this i know  and i am among them  
 so we have a suffering god a god who is intimately connected with this world
 and with every living soul i very much relate to this idea of god
 but it isn 't enough i need to ask some more questions  and i hope they are questions that you will want to ask as well some of you 
 over the last few weeks i have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship
 have felt a bit inappropriate a bit dodgy we have a pram service on tuesday mornings for mums and their pre school children and last week we
  sang with the children one of their favorite songs the wise man built his house upon the rock perhaps some of you know it 
 some of the words go like this the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the floods came up and the house on the sand went
 crash 
 then in the same week at a funeral we sang
  familiar hymn we plow the fields and scatter a very english hymn  
 in the second verse comes the line the wind and waves obey him 
 do they  
 i don 't feel we can sing that song again in church after what 's happened 
 so the first big question is about control does god have a plan
  for each of us is god in control does god order each moment  does the wind and the waves obey him  
 from time to time one hears christians telling the story of how god organized things for them  
 so that everything worked out all right
 some difficulty overcome some illness cured some trouble averted
  a parking space found at a crucial time  
 i can remember someone saying this to me with her eyes shining with enthusiasm
 at this wonderful confirmation of her faith
 and the goodness of god  
 but if god can or will do these things intervene to change the flow of events then surely
 he could have stopped the tsunami do we have a local god
 who can do little things like parking spaces  but not big things like five hundred mile per hour waves 
 that 's just not acceptable
 to intelligent christians and we must acknowledge it either god is responsible for the tsunami  or god is not in control
  after the tragedy  survival stories began to emerge you probably heard some of them  the man who surfed the wave 
 the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school  
 then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the hills  
 the preacher delivered an extra long sermon
  that they were still out of harm 's way
 when the wave struck afterwards someone said that god must have been looking after them  
 so the next question is about partiality can we earn god 's favor by worshipping him
 or believing in him  does god demand loyalty like any medieval tyrant
  a god
 who looks after his own  so that christians are ok  while everyone else perishes 
 a cosmic us and them 
 and a god
 who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism 
 that would be appalling and that would be the point at which i would hand in my membership
  such a god would be morally inferior
 to the highest ideals of humanity 
 so who is god if not the great puppet master or the tribal protector  
 perhaps god allows or permits terrible things to happen  so that heroism
 and compassion can be shown perhaps god is testing us
  our charity or our faith 
 perhaps there is a great cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out ok in the end  
 perhaps but these ideas
 are all just variations on god controlling everything the supreme commander toying
 with expendable units in a great campaign
 are still left with a god who can do the tsunami and allow auschwitz 
 in his great novel the brothers karamazov 
 dostoevsky gives these words to ivan addressed to his naive
 and devout younger brother alyosha if the sufferings of children
 go to make up the sum of sufferings
  which is necessary for the purchase of truth then i say beforehand that the entire truth
 is not worth such a price  
 we cannot afford to pay so much for admission 
 it is not god that i do not accept  i merely most respectfully  return him the ticket
  or perhaps
 god set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever  
 so that natural processes could occur  and evolution run its course  
 this seems more acceptable  but it still leaves god
 with the ultimate moral
  is god a cold unfeeling spectator  
 or a powerless lover  watching with infinite compassion things god is unable to control or change 
 is god
 intimately involved in our suffering so that he feels it in his own being 
  take our leave of the almighty controller  abandon traditional models  we must think again about god  
 maybe god doesn 't do things at all  maybe god isn 't an agent like all of us are
  early religious thought conceived god as a sort of superhuman person  doing things all over the place beating up the egyptians  
 drowning them in the red sea wasting cities  
 getting angry  
 the people knew their god
 by his mighty acts  but what if god doesn 't act what if god
 doesn 't do things at all what if god
 is in things the
  loving soul of the universe
 compassionate presence underpinning and sustaining all things what if god is in things  
 in the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life  
 in the natural cycle of life and death the creation
 and destruction
 that must happen continuously  
 in the process of evolution in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world  
 in the collective unconscious  the soul of the human race in you in
  and body and spirit  in the tsunami  
 in the victims  in the depth of things 
 in presence and in absence  in simplicity and complexity  in change and development and growth 
 how does this in ness this innerness this interiority of god work 
 's hard to conceive and begs more questions is god just another name for the universe with no independent existence at all  
 i don 't know 
 to what extent can we ascribe personality to god  i don 't know  
 in the end we have to say i don 't know if we knew god would not be god 
 to have faith in this god would be more like
  trusting an essential benevolence in the universe  and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements 
 isn 't it ironic that christians who claim to believe in an infinite unknowable being then tie god down in closed systems and rigid doctrines 
 how could one practice such a faith
 by seeking the god within 
 by cultivating my own inwardness  in silence in meditation 
 in my inner space  in the me that remains
 when i gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations
  in awareness of the inner conversation  
 and how would we live such a faith  
 how would i live such a faith by seeking intimate connection with your inwardness 
 the kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep 
 if god is in all people then there is a meeting place
 where my
  relationship with you
 becomes a three way encounter there is an indian greeting which i 'm sure some of you know namaste 
 accompanied by a respectful bow which roughly translated means that which is of god in me
  and how would one deepen such a faith 
 by seeking the inwardness which is in all things  in music and poetry  in the natural world of beauty
 and in the small ordinary things of life there is a deep indwelling presence that
  it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting a contemplative attitude
 and a generosity and openness
 to those whose experience is different from my own 
 when i stood up to speak to my people about god and the tsunami i had no answers to offer them 
 no neat packages of faith with bible references to prove them
  only doubts
 and questioning
 and uncertainty  
 i had some suggestions to make possible new ways of thinking about god  
 ways that might allow us to go on down a new and uncharted road  
 but in the end  the only thing i could say for sure was i don 't know
 just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all
