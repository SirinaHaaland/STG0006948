  new york city  
 between harlem and the bronx 
 growing up as a boy we were taught that men had to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no pain
  no emotions with the exception of anger and definitely no fear that men are in charge  which means women are not 
 that men lead  and you should just follow and do what we say  
 that men are superior women are inferior  that men are strong women are weak 
 that women are of less value  
 property of
  i 've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men  better known as
 the man box 
 see this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man  now i also want to say  without a doubt there are some wonderful wonderful  absolutely wonderful things about being a man
  time 
 there 's some stuff that 's just straight up twisted  
 and we really need to begin to challenge  look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing  redefining what we come to know as manhood 
 this is my two at home kendall and jay  they 're eleven and twelve kendall 's fifteen months older than jay
 time when my wife her name is tammie and i we just got real busy and whip bam boom kendall and jay 
 and when they were about five and six four and five jay could come to me  come to me crying  it didn 't matter what she was crying about 
 she could get on my knee she could snot my sleeve up just cry cry it out daddy 's got you that 's all that 's important
  now kendall on the other hand and like i said he 's only fifteen months older than her
 he 'd come to me crying it 's like as soon as i would hear him cry a clock would go off
  i would give the boy probably about thirty seconds  which means  by the time he got to me  i was already saying things like why are you crying 
 hold your head up  look at me  explain to me what 's wrong tell me what 's wrong
  i can 't understand you why are you crying and out of my own frustration
 of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box  i would find myself saying things like just go in your room 
 just go on go on in your room  sit down get yourself together
 and
  come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a what like a man  and he 's five years
 as i grow in life i would say to myself my god what 's wrong with me what am i doing why would i do this and i think back i
 i think back
 to my father there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family 
 my brother henry he died tragically when we were teenagers  we lived in new york city as i said we lived in the bronx at the time and
 the burial was in a place called long island it was about two hours outside of the city  
 and as we were preparing to come back from the burial the cars stopped at the bathroom
  to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city 
 and the limousine empties out my mother my sister my auntie they all get out but my father and i stayed in the limousine 
 and no sooner than the women got out 
 he burst out crying  
 he didn 't want cry in front of me  but he knew he wasn 't going to make it back to the city and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and
  emotions in front of the women  and this is a man who ten minutes ago had just put his teenage son in the ground
 something i just can 't even imagine 
 the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me
 for crying in front of me and at the same time he was also giving me props lifting me
 for not crying
 i come to also look at this as this this fear that we have as men this fear that just has us paralyzed holding us hostage
 to this man box  i can remember speaking to a 12 year old boy a football player  and i asked him i said how would you feel
 if in front of all the players your coach told you
  you were playing like a girl now i expected him to say something like i 'd be sad i 'd be mad i 'd be angry or something like that no the boy said to me
 the boy said to me it would destroy me and i said to myself god 
 if it would destroy him to be called a girl
  it took me back to a time when i was about twelve years old
  i grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city at this time we 're living in the bronx  and in the building next to where i lived there was a guy named johnny  
 he was about sixteen years old and we were
  all about twelve years old younger guys  and he was hanging out with all us younger guys  and this guy he was up to a lot of no good he was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder what is this 16 year old boy doing with these 12 year old boys 
 and he did spend a lot of time up to no good he was a troubled kid  his mother had died from a heroin overdose  he was being raised by his
 grandmother his father wasn 't on the set his grandmother had two jobs he was home alone a lot
  tell you we young guys  we looked up to this dude man  he was cool  
 he was fine that 's what the sisters said he was fine he was having sex
  we all looked up to him  so one day i 'm out in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something i don 't know what he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said hey anthony they called me anthony growing up as a kid hey anthony come on upstairs 
  johnny call you go so i run right upstairs 
 as he opens the door he says to me do you want some 
 now i immediately knew what he meant  because for me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you want some meant one of two things sex or drugs
 and we weren 't doing drugs now my box  my card  my man box card was immediately in jeopardy
  i never had sex  we don 't talk about that as men you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex for everybody else we go around like we 've been having sex since we were two there ain 't no first time 
 the other thing i couldn 't tell him is that i didn 't want any that 's even worse we 're supposed to always be on the prowl women are objects  especially sexual objects
 anyway so i couldn 't tell him any of that
  mother would say make a long story short i just simply said to johnny yes he told me to go in his room i go in his room on his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila  she 's sixteen years old  she 's nude 
 she 's what i know today to be mentally ill  higher functioning at times than others we had a whole choice of
 inappropriate names for
  johnny had just gotten through having sex with her well actually he raped her but he would say he had sex with her  because while sheila never said
 no she also never said yes  so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same so when i go in the room i close the door folks i 'm petrified
 i stand with my back to the door so johnny can 't bust in the room and see that i 'm not doing anything  and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something  so now i 'm no longer trying to figure out what i 'm going to do i 'm trying to figure out how i 'm going
  get out of this room  so in my twelve years of wisdom  
 i zip my pants down  i walk out into the room and lo and behold to me  while i was in the
 room with sheila johnny was back at the window calling guys up so now there 's a living room full of guys it was like the waiting room in the doctor 's office and they asked me how
  and i say to them it was good 
 and i zip my pants up in front of them and i head for the door 
 now i say this all with remorse and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but i was conflicted because while i was feeling remorse i was excited  because i didn 't get caught  but i knew i felt bad about what was happening 
 this fear getting outside the man box  totally enveloped me enveloped me it was way more
  and my man box card
 than about sheila and what was happening
 to her 
 see collectively  we as men are taught to have less value in women to view them as property and the objects of men  we see that as an equation that equals violence against women 
 we as men good men the large majority of men  
 we operate on the foundation of this this whole collective socialization we kind of see ourselves separate but we 're very much a part of it you see
 we have to come to understand that less value  property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can 't happen without it  so we 're very much a part of the solution 
 as well as the problem the center for disease control says that men 's violence against women is at epidemic proportions is the number one health concern for women in this country
  this is the love of my life my daughter jay  
 the world i envision for her how do i want men to be acting and behaving  i need you on board  i need you with me  i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men
 that it 's okay to not be dominating that it 's okay to have feelings and emotions that
  's okay to promote equality that it 's okay to have women who are just friends and that 's it that it 's okay to be whole 
 that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman i remember asking a nine year old boy 
 i asked a nine year old boy 
 what would life be like for you if you didn 't have to adhere to this man box he said to me i would be free
