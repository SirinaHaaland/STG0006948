  it 's amazing when you meet a head of state and you say what is your most precious natural resource they will not say children
 at first and then when you say children they will pretty quickly
 agree with you
  traveling today with the minister of defense of colombia
 head of the army and the head of the police  and we 're dropping off six hundred and fifty laptops today to children who have no television no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past
  the importance of delivering
 laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the farc the guerrillas that started off forty years ago as a political movement
 and then became a drug movement 
 there are one billion children in the world and fifty percent of them don 't have electricity at home or at school  
  and in some countries let me pick afghanistan seventy five percent of the little girls don 't go to school and i don 't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade they don 't go so in the three years
 since i talked at ted and showed a prototype it 's gone from an idea
 to a real laptop  we have half a million laptops today in the hands of children 
 we have about a quarter of a million in transit
 to those and other children
 there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment  so in rough numbers there are a million laptops that 's smaller than i predicted i predicted three to ten million but is still a very large number
  in colombia we have about three thousand laptops  it 's the minister of defense with whom we 're working not the
  of education because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of
 liberating these zones that had
 been completely closed off in which the people who
 had been causing if you will forty years ' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived and suddenly 
 the kids have connected laptops  they 've leapfrogged
  absolutely monumental because it 's not just opening it up but it 's opening it up to the rest of the world  so yes they 're building roads yes they 're putting in telephone yes there will be television 
 but the kids six to twelve years old are surfing the internet in spanish and in local languages  so the children grow up with access
  with a window into the rest of the world before they were closed off
  interestingly enough  in other countries it will be the minister of finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth
  and that engine is going to see the results in twenty years it 's not going to happen you know in one year  but it 's an important 
 deeply economic and cultural change that happens through
  in total are involved  
 and in the case of uruguay half the children already have them and by the middle of two thousand and nine  every single child  in uruguay
 will have a laptop a little green laptop
  now what are some of the results some of the results
 that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved
  teaching so much  and reading comprehension measured by third parties not by us skyrockets  probably the most important thing we see
 is children teaching parents  
 they own the laptops they take them home  and so when i met with three children from the schools who had traveled all day to come to bogota 
 one of the three children
 brought her mother
  and the reason she brought her mother is that this
  child
 had been teaching her mother how to read and write her mother had not gone to primary school 
 and this is such an inversion and such a wonderful example
 of children being the agents of
  so now in closing people say now why laptops laptops are a luxury it 's like giving them ipods  no 
 the reason you want laptops is that the word is education not laptop  this is an education project not a laptop project 
 they need to learn learning  and then just think they can have let 's say one hundred books 
 in a village  you have one hundred laptops  each with a different set of one hundred books  and so that village suddenly has ten
 thousand books you and i didn 't have ten thousand books when we went to primary school
  sometimes school is under a tree 
 or in many cases the
 teacher has only a fifth grade education  so you need a collaborative model of learning not just building more schools and training more teachers which you have to do anyway  
 so we 're once again doing 
  give one get one program and it generated over one hundred thousand laptops that we were then able to give free  
 and by being a zero dollar laptop we can go to countries
 that can 't afford it at all 
 and that 's what we did we went to haiti we went to rwanda afghanistan  ethiopia mongolia places that are not markets 
 seeding it
 with the principles of saturation connectivity low
  ages etc  and then we can actually roll out large numbers
