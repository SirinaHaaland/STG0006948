  here 's a question we need to rethink together  what should be the role of money
 and markets in our societies  today there are
  very few things that money can 't buy 
 if you 're sentenced to a jail term in santa barbara california 
 you should know that if you don 't like the standard accommodations you can buy a prison cell upgrade 
 it 's true for how much do you think what would you guess  five hundred dollars it 's not the
 you go to an amusement park and don 't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides there is now
 a solution  in many theme parks you can pay extra
 to jump to the head of the line they call them fast track or vip tickets  
 and this isn 't only happening in amusement parks  in washington
 d c long lines queues sometimes form for
 important congressional hearings  now
 some people don 't like to wait in long queues maybe overnight  even in the rain  
 so now for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don 't like to wait there are companies
  you can go to them  
 you can pay them a certain amount of money they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes 
 and the lobbyist just before the hearing begins can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room 
 paid line standing  
  the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions  in bigger arenas 
 take the way we fight our wars  did you know that in iraq and afghanistan 
 there were more private military contractors on the ground
 than there were u s military troops  
 now this isn 't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies
  but this is what has happened over the past three decades  we have lived through a quiet
 revolution we 've drifted
 almost without realizing it from having a market economy
 to becoming market societies  the difference is this a market economy is a tool
  valuable and effective tool for organizing productive activity  but a market society is a place
 where almost everything is up for sale it
 's a way of life  
 in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life  
  why worry about our becoming
 market societies  for two reasons i think 
 one of them has to do with inequality  
 the more things
  things money can buy  the more affluence or the lack of it matters if the only thing that money determined
 was access to yachts or fancy vacations or bmws 
 then inequality wouldn 't matter very much  
 but when money comes increasingly to govern access
 to the essentials of the good life
 decent health care
  access to the best education  political voice and influence in campaigns
 when money comes to govern all of those things 
 inequality matters a great deal  and so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting
 of inequality and its social and
  that 's one reason to worry there 's a second reason apart
 from the worry about inequality and it 's this with some social
 goods and practices when market thinking
 and market values enter they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out
 attitudes and norms worth caring about
  like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism a cash incentive and see what you think about it 
 many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds 
 to study hard
  to do well in school to apply themselves some economists have proposed
 a market solution offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores
 or for reading books they 've tried this actually they 've done some experiments in
 some major american cities  in new york  in chicago in washington d c they 've tried this offering
 fifty dollars for an a
  dollars for a b in dallas texas they have a program that offers eight year olds two dollars for each book they read 
 so let 's see what some people are in favor some people are opposed
 to this cash incentive to motivate achievement let 's see what people here think about it imagine that you are the head of a
 major school system
  someone comes to you with this proposal and let 's say it 's a foundation they will provide the funds you don 't have to take it out of your budget  how many would be in favor and how many would be opposed
 to giving it a try let 's see by a show of hands first 
 how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work raise your hand 
  and how many would be opposed how many would
 so the majority here are opposed but
 a sizable minority are in favor let 's have a discussion let 's start with those of you who object 
 who would rule it out even before trying what would be your reason who will get our discussion
 started  yes heike moses hello everyone i 'm heike and i think it just kills the intrinsic motivation
 if they would like to read you just take this incentive away in just paying them so it just changes behavior michael sandel 
 takes the intrinsic incentive away what 
  or should be the intrinsic motivation hm well the intrinsic motivation should be to learn ms to learn hm to get to know the world  
 and then if you stop paying them what happens then then
  they stop reading ms now let 's see if there 's someone who favors who thinks it 's worth trying this elizabeth loftus i 'm elizabeth loftus and
 you said worth a try so why not try it and do the experiment and
 measure things ms and measure  and what would you measure you 'd measure how
  how many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them ms oh after you stopped paying all
 right what about that hm to be frank  i just think this is 
 not to offend anyone a very american way ms all right 
 what 's emerged from this discussion is the following question will the cash incentive
 drive out or corrupt or crowd out
 the higher motivation the intrinsic
 lesson that we hope to convey  which is to learn to love to learn and to read
 for their own sakes  and people disagree about what the effect will be
  but that seems to be the question that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive
 teaches the wrong lesson  
 and if it does  what will become of these children later  i should tell you what 's happened with these experiments 
 the cash for good grades
 has had very mixed results for the most part has not resulted in higher grades the two dollars for each book
 did lead those kids to read more books
 it also led them to read shorter books 
 but the real question is what will become of these kids later will they have learned that reading is a chore 
 a form of piecework to be done for pay that 's the worry or may it
 now  what this  even this brief debate  brings out is something that many economists overlook economists often assume
 that markets are inert that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange market exchange
  they assume 
 doesn 't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged this may be true enough if we 're talking about material goods if you sell me a flat screen television
 or give me one as a gift it will be the same good it will work the same either way  but the same may not be true
 if we 're talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life
  life  in those domains  bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives
 may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes
 worth caring about once we see
 that markets and commerce when extended beyond the material domain
  change the character of the goods
 themselves  can change the meaning of the social practices as in the example of teaching and learning 
 we have to ask
 where markets belong
 and where they don 't where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about but to have this debate
  debate we have to do something we 're not very good at and that is to reason together in public
 about the value and the meaning
 of the social practices we prize from our bodies
 to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning
 to civic life  now these are controversial
  questions  and so we tend to shrink from them 
 in fact during the past three decades  when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige 
 our public discourse during this time
 has become hollowed out empty of larger moral meaning for fear of disagreement we shrink from these
  questions  but once we see
 that markets change the character of goods  we have to debate among ourselves
 these bigger questions about how to value goods one of the most corrosive effects
 of putting a price on everything
 is on commonality the sense that we are all in it
  together  against the background of rising inequality
 every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent
 and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate
  we live and work and shop and play in different places our children go to different schools 
 this isn 't good for democracy  
 nor is it a satisfying way to live even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line 
 here 's why 
 democracy does not require perfect equality but what it does require
 is that citizens share in a common life
 what matters
 is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life
 encounter one another bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life  because this is what
 teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences  and this is how
  we come to care for the common good  
 and so in the end the question of markets is not mainly an economic question 
 it 's really a question of how we want to live together do we want a society
 where everything is up for sale  or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor
  and money cannot buy  thank you very much
