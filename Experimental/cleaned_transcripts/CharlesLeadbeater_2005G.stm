  what i 'm going to do in the spirit of collaborative creativity is simply repeat
 many of the points that the three people before me have already made but do them
 this is called creative collaboration
  but do it through a particular perspective and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of
 collaborative creativity that jimmy and others have talked about
 let me just ask you to start with this simple question
 who invented the mountain bike 
 because traditional economic theory would say well the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r & d lab where they were thinking
  up new projects  and it came out of there it didn 't come from there 
 another answer might be well it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage who working away on different kinds of bikes comes up with a bike out of
 thin air it didn 't come from there  the mountain bike
 came from users came from young users particularly a group in
  who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes which were those sort of bikes that eddy merckx rode or your big brother and they 're very glamorous
 but also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode which sort of had big handlebars like that and they were too heavy so they got the frames from these big bikes put them together with the gears from the racing bikes 
 got the brakes from
 motorcycles
 and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients and for the first i don 't know three to five years of their life mountain
  bikes were known as clunkers and they were just made in a community of bikers  mainly in northern california  and then one of these companies that was importing parts
 for the clunkers decided to set up in business start selling them to other people and gradually another company emerged out of that marin
  and it probably was i don 't know ten  maybe even fifteen
  before the big bike companies realized there was a market  thirty years later  
 mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for sixty five percent of bike sales in america that 's fifty eight billion dollars 
 this is a category entirely created by consumers
 that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn 't see the need the opportunity  they didn 't have the incentive to innovate
  the one thing i think i disagree with
 yochai 's presentation is when he said the internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive it 's when the internet combines with these kinds 
  of passionate pro am consumers who are knowledgeable they 've got the incentive to innovate they 've got the tools they want to that you get this kind of explosion of creative
  need for the kind of things that jimmy was talking about which is our new kinds of organization or a better way to put it how do we organize ourselves without organizations that 's now possible 
  you don 't need an organization to be organized to achieve large and complex tasks like innovating new software programs  
  view  still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity
 is that creativity is about special people 
 wear baseball caps the wrong way round come to conferences like this in special places  elite universities r & d labs in the forests water
  maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors
  odd table football table
  special people special places think up special ideas then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers who are passive 
 they can say yes or no to the invention that 's the idea of creativity what 's the policy recommendation out of that if you 're in government  or you 're running a large company
  more special people more special places  build creative clusters in
 cities create more r  & d parks so on and so forth expand the pipeline down to the consumers  
 well this view i think is increasingly wrong  i think it 's always been wrong  because i think always creativity has been highly collaborative  and it 's probably been largely interactive  
 but it 's increasingly wrong  and one of the reasons it 's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline the ideas
  are coming back from the consumers  and they 're often ahead of the producers why is that well  one
 issue is that radical innovation when you 've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people 
 have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them the payoffs to
  are greatest
 where the uncertainty is highest and when you get a radical innovation it 's often very uncertain how it can be applied the whole history of telephony
 is a story of dealing with that uncertainty 
 the very first landline telephones  
 the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from west end theaters 
 when the mobile telephone companies invented sms they had no idea what it was for it
  was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use 
 so the more radical the innovation  the more the uncertainty the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for all of our patents our entire approach to patents and
  is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for we can say what it 's for 
 more and more the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance it will be worked out in use in collaboration
 with users
  we like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea  
 the truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative like wikipedia
  it develops over a long period of time  
 the second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big disruptive innovations 
 if you want to find the big new ideas it 's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets  in big organizations 
 and just look inside large organizations and you 'll see why that is so
  so you 're in a big corporation  you 're obviously keen to go up the
 corporate ladder do you go into your board and say look i 've got a fantastic idea
 for an embryonic product in a marginal market with consumers we 've never dealt with before  and i 'm not sure it 's going to have a big payoff but it could be really really big in the future
  what you do is you go in and you say i 've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users and i can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years 
 big corporations have an in built tendency to reinforce past success  they 've got so much sunk in it
 that it 's very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets emerging new markets then are the breeding grounds for passionate users
 best example
  who in the music industry  thirty years ago 
 would have said yes let 's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to
  so what happens rap music is created by the users they do it on their own tapes with their own recording equipment they distribute it themselves  thirty years later  rap music is the dominant 
 musical form of popular culture would never have come from the big companies had to start
  at these people who are amateurs i e they do it for the love of it but they want to do it to very high standards  and across a whole range of fields from software astronomy
  natural sciences vast areas of leisure and culture like kite surfing so on and so forth you
 find people
 who want to do things because they love it but they want to do these things to very high standards  they work at their leisure if you like they take their leisure very seriously  they acquire skills they invest time  
 they use technology that 's getting cheaper it 's not just the internet 
 cameras design technology  leisure technology surfboards so on and so forth 
 largely through globalization
  a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper more knowledgeable consumers more educated more able to connect with one another more able to do things together 
 consumption in that sense is an expression of their productive potential 
 why we found people were interested in this is that at work they don 't feel very expressed
  they don 't feel as if they 're doing something that really matters to them
  so they pick up these kinds of activities this has huge organizational implications for
  very large areas of life take astronomy as an example which
 yochai has already mentioned  
 twenty years ago  thirty years ago 
 only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space and there 's a big telescope in northern england called jodrell bank and when i
  a kid it was amazing because the moon shots would take off and this thing would move on rails and it was huge it was absolutely enormous now six
 amateur astronomers working with the internet with dobsonian digital telescopes which are pretty much open source
 with some light sensors developed over the last ten years the internet they can do what jodrell bank could only do thirty years ago  
 so here in astronomy you have this vast explosion of new productive resources
  users can be producers  
 what does this mean then for our organizational landscape  well just imagine a world for the moment divided into two
 camps over here you 've got the old traditional corporate model special people special places patent it push it down the pipeline to largely waiting passive consumers 
 over here  let 's imagine
  we 've got wikipedia  linux and beyond open source this is open this is closed 
 this is new this is traditional well
 the first thing you can say  i think with certainty is what yochai has said already is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms 
 these people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding  
 because they 're threatened by them
 and so the debates about copyright digital
 rights so on and so forth these are all about trying to stifle  in my view these kinds of organizations what we 're seeing is a complete corruption of the 
  idea of patents and copyright  meant to be a way to incentivize invention
  meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place  
 let me just give you two examples 
 the first is imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying i 've got a fantastic idea i 've invented this brilliant new program
 that is much much better than microsoft outlook
  which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with microsoft with microsoft outlook no one that is why the competition with microsoft is bound to come will only come from an open source kind of project 
 so there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open source and consumer driven innovation because it 's one of the greatest competitive levers
  be huge professional arguments as well  because the professionals over here in these closed organizations they might be academics they might be
 programmers they might be doctors  they might be journalists
 my former profession say no no you can 't trust these people over here when i started in journalism
 financial times twenty years ago
 it was very very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper
 and you 'd kind of look over their shoulder on the tube to see if they were reading your reading your article  usually they were reading the share prices and the the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor or something like that and you know 
 for heaven 's sake what are they doing they 're not reading my brilliant article 
 and we allowed users  readers two places where they could contribute to the paper the letters page  where they could write a letter in and we would condescend to
  cut it in half and print it three days later or the op ed page where if they knew the editor had been to school with him slept with his wife
 they could write an article for the op ed page  
 those were the two places  shock horror now the readers want to be writers and publishers that 's not their role they 're supposed to read what we write but they don 't want to be
  the journalists think that the the bloggers want to be journalists they don 't want to be journalists  they just want to have a voice  they want to as jimmy said they want to have a dialogue a conversation they want to be part of that
 flow of information  what 's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding so there 's going to be a tremendous struggle 
 but also there 's going to be tremendous movement from
 the open to the closed
  two things that are critical  
 and these i think are two challenges for the open movement the first is can we really survive on volunteers  
 if this is so critical do we not need it funded organized supported in much more structured ways
 i think the idea of creating the red cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea  
 but can we really organize that just on volunteers  what kind of changes do we need in public
  policy and funding to make that possible  what 's the role of the bbc for instance  in that world what should be the role of public policy 
 and finally what i think you will see
 is the intelligent closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction so it 's not going to be a contest between two camps
  in between them you 'll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy new organizational models coming about mixing closed and open in tricky 
  ways  it won 't be so clear cut it won 't be microsoft versus linux there 'll be all sorts of things in between 
  let me just give you one final example of what that means i was in shanghai 
 in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago one of the two thousand five hundred skyscrapers they 've built in shanghai in the last ten years  and i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan 
 timothy chan set up an internet business in
 two thousand didn 't go into the internet kept his money decided to go into computer games
 he runs a company called shanda which is the largest computer games company in china  nine thousand servers all over china  
 has two
 hundred and fifty million subscribers at any one time there are four million people playing one of his games  
 how many people does he employ to service that population 
 five hundred
 how can he service two hundred and fifty million people from five hundred employees because basically he doesn 't service them he gives them a platform 
 he gives them some rules
 he gives them the tools
 and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation he orchestrates the action  
 but actually a lot of the content is created by the users themselves  and it creates a kind of stickiness
  the community and the company which is really really powerful the best measure of that so you go into one of his games
  you create a character that you develop in the course of the game  if for some reason your credit card bounces or
 there 's some other problem  you lose your character  you 've got two options 
 one option you can create a new character  right from scratch but with none of the history
  of your player that costs about one hundred dollars  or you can get on a plane fly to shanghai  queue up outside shanda 's offices
 cost probably six hundred seven hundred dollars and reclaim your character get your history back 
 every morning there are six hundred people queuing outside their offices
  so this is about companies built on communities that provide communities with tools 
 resources platforms in which they can share 
 he 's not open source  but it 's very very powerful  so here is one of the challenges i think for people like me who
 do a lot of work with government  if you 're a games company
  and you 've got a million players in your game  you only need one
 contributing ideas and you 've got a development workforce of ten thousand people 
 imagine you could take all the children in education in britain  and one percent of them were co developers of education 
 what would that do to the resources available to the education system or if you got one percent of the patients in the nhs
 to in some sense be
 of health the reason why despite all the efforts to cut it down to constrain it to hold it back why these open models will still start 
  emerging with tremendous force is that they multiply our productive resources
