  i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival  it 's a place
 where women run the show have sex to say hello and play rules the day
 where fun is serious business
  burning man or san francisco 
 ladies and gentlemen  meet your cousins  this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo 
 bonobos are together with chimpanzees your living closest relative 
 that means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother  who lived around six million
  years ago  now chimpanzees are well known for their aggression 
 but unfortunately  we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution  
 but bonobos show us the other side of the coin  while chimpanzees are dominated
 by big scary guys bonobo society is run by empowered females 
 these guys have really worked something out since this leads to a highly tolerant society
 where fatal violence has not been observed yet  but unfortunately  bonobos are the least understood of the great apes
  they live in the depths of the congolese jungle  and it has been very difficult to study them the congo is a paradox
 a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty  but also the heart of darkness itself
 the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as
  first world war not surprisingly this destruction
 also endangers bonobo survival  bushmeat trades and forest loss
 means we couldn 't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world and we 're not even sure of that to be honest
  in this land of violence and chaos you can hear hidden laughter
 swaying the trees  who are these cousins we know them as the make love not war apes
 since they have frequent  promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues  
  i 'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity 's problems
 since there 's more to bonobo life than the kama sutra 
 bonobos like humans love to play throughout their entire lives play is not just child 's games 
 for us and them play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance it
 's where we learn to trust
 and where we learn about the rules of the game  play increases creativity
  creativity and resilience  and it 's all about the generation of diversity
 diversity of interactions diversity of behaviors  diversity of connections 
 and when you watch bonobo play you 're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter
  dance and ritual 
 play is the glue that binds us
  together  
 now  i don 't know how you play  
 but i want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild first it 's a ball game  bonobo style
 and i do not mean football  so here  
 we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game
  have a look what she 's doing  it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase she 's got him by the balls only
 i think that he 's rather loving it here right yeah 
 so sex play is common in both bonobos and humans  and this video is really interesting because it shows
  this video 's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play such as testicles and
 and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust
 while at the same time being tremendous fun but play 's a shapeshifter 
 play 's a shapeshifter and it can take many forms some of
  more quiet  imaginative curious maybe where wonder is discovered anew  
 and i want you to see  this is fuku a young female and she is quietly playing with water
 i think like her we sometimes play alone  and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds 
  that playful curiosity that drives us to explore drives us to interact  and then the unexpected connections we form
 are the real hotbed for creativity  so these are just small tasters
 into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present 
 but they also hold a secret for our future a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world
  creativity and greater cooperation 
 the secret is that play is the key to these capacities 
 in other words play is our adaptive wildcard 
 in order to adapt successfully to a changing world we need to play
 but will we make the most of our playfulness play is not
  frivolous 
 play 's essential for bonobos and humans alike life is not just red in tooth and claw  
 in times when it seems least appropriate to play it might be the times when it is most urgent  
 and so my fellow primates  let us
 embrace this gift from evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity  fellowship
 and wonder thank you
