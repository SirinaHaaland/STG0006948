  as he said and what that means is that i argue it 's an important part of my life  and i like to argue and i 'm not just an academic i 'm a
  so i like to think that i 'm actually pretty good at arguing  but i also like to think a lot about arguing  and
 in thinking about arguing  i 've come across some puzzles and one of the puzzles is that as i 've been thinking about arguing over the years and it 's been decades now
 i 've gotten better at arguing  but the more that i argue and the better i get at arguing 
 the more that i lose  and that 's a puzzle and the other puzzle is that i 'm actually okay with that why is it that i 'm okay with
  losing and why is it that i think good arguers are actually better at losing  well there are some other puzzles one is why do we argue  who benefits from arguments
 when i think about arguments  i 'm talking about
 let 's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments where something cognitive is at stake is this proposition true is this theory a good theory is
  a viable interpretation of the data or the text  and so on i 'm not interested really in arguments about
 whose turn it is to do the dishes or who
 has to take out the garbage  
 yeah  we have those arguments too 
 i tend to win those arguments because i know the tricks  but those aren 't the important arguments  i 'm interested in academic arguments  and here are the things that puzzle me  
 first
  what do good arguers win
 when they win an argument  what do i win if i convince you that utilitarianism isn 't really the right framework for thinking about ethical
  theories  what do we win when we win an argument  even before that what does it matter to me whether you have this this idea that
 kant 's theory works or or mill is the right ethicist to follow it 's no skin off my back
 whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind  
 so why do we even try to argue why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don 't want to believe and
 is that even a nice thing to
  do is that a nice way to treat another human being try and make them think something they don 't want to think 
 well 
 my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments the first model let 's call it the dialectical model is we think of arguments as war  you know what that 's like a lot of screaming and and shouting and winning and losing 
 that 's not a very helpful model
  it 's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing  but there 's a second model for arguing arguments as proofs think of a mathematician 's argument  
 here 's my argument  does it work is it any good are the premises
 warranted are the inferences valid  does the conclusion follow from the premises 
 no opposition no adversariality not necessarily any
 arguing in the adversarial sense  but there 's a third model to keep in mind that i think is
 and that is
 arguments as performances arguments  in front of an audience we can think of a politician trying to
 present a position trying to convince the audience of something  but there 's another twist on this model that i that i really think is important namely that when we argue
 before an audience sometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument  that is arguments are also
 in front of juries  who make a judgment and decide the case let 's call this the rhetorical model where you have to tailor your argument
 to the audience at hand  you know presenting a sound well argued tight argument
 in english before a francophone audience just isn 't going to work so we have these models argument as war argument as proof and argument as performance
 of those three the argument as war is the dominant one 
 it dominates how we talk about arguments  
 it dominates how we think about arguments and because of that it shapes how we argue our actual conduct in arguments  
 now  when we talk about arguments  we talk in a very militaristic language we want strong arguments arguments that have a
  arguments that are right on target we want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order we want
 killer arguments that 's the kind of argument we want  
 it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments when i 'm talking about arguments that 's probably what you thought of the adversarial model 
 but the the war metaphor the war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments has i think deforming effects on how we argue  
 first it elevates tactics over substance
  you can take a class in logic argumentation you learn all about the the subterfuges that people use to try and win arguments the false steps  it magnifies the
 us versus them aspect of it it makes it adversarial  it 's polarizing and
 the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph glorious triumph
  ignominious defeat i think those are deforming effects and worst of all it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation
 or compromise or
 collaboration think about that one have you ever entered an argument thinking let 's see if we can
 hash something out rather than fight it out  what can we work out together i think the argument as war metaphor
 inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation and
 this is really
 the worst thing arguments don 't seem to get us anywhere they 're dead ends they are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in
 conversation we don 't get anywhere
  and one more thing and as an educator this is the one that that really bothers me if argument is war  then there 's an implicit equation of
 learning with losing and let me explain what i mean
 suppose you and i
 have an argument  you believe a proposition p  and i don 't and i say well
 why do you believe p and you give me your reasons  and i object and say well what about 
 and you answer my objection  and i have a question well what do you mean 
 how does it apply over here and you answer my
  and in every case you 've responded
 to my satisfaction  and so at the end of the day  i say you know what i guess you 're right p 
 so i have a new belief  and it 's not just any belief  it 's
 who won that argument  
 well the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won even though i 'm the only one who made any cognitive gain  what did you gain  cognitively 
 from convincing me  sure you got some pleasure out of it maybe your ego stroked  maybe you get some professional status status in the field this guy 's a good arguer
  war metaphor forces us into thinking that
 you 're the winner and i lost even though
 i gained  and there 's something wrong with that picture  and that 's the picture i really want to want to change if we can so how can we find
 ways to make arguments
 yield something positive  what we need is new exit strategies for arguments  but we 're not going to have new exit
  strategies for arguments until we have new
 entry approaches to arguments  we need to think of new kinds of arguments in order to do that well
 i don 't know how to do that that 's the bad news the argument as war metaphor is just it 's a monster  it 's just taken up
 habitation in our mind
  there 's no magic bullet that 's going to kill it there 's no magic wand that 's going to make it disappear i don 't have an answer  but i have some suggestions  here  's my my suggestion  
 if we want to think of new kinds of arguments  what we need to do
 is think of new kinds of arguers so
 try this think of all the roles
 that people play in arguments  there 's the proponent and the opponent
 in an adversarial dialectical argument  there 's the
  audience in rhetorical arguments  there 's the reasoner in in arguments as proofs 
 all these different roles now can you imagine an argument
 in which you are the arguer but you 're also in the audience watching yourself argue  can you imagine yourself
 watching yourself argue losing the argument  and yet
  you do that 
 i think you can and i think if you can imagine that kind of argument where the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say yeah that was a good argument 
 then you have imagined a good argument  and more than that i think you 've imagined
 a good arguer an arguer that 's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be now i lose a lot of arguments
  to become a a good arguer in the sense of being able to benefit from losing  but fortunately i 've had many many colleagues who have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me  thank you
