  i have a confession to make 
 but first  i want you to make a little confession to me 
 in the past year i want you to just raise your hand
 if you 've experienced relatively little stress
  anyone how
 about a moderate amount of stress  
 who has experienced a lot of stress  yeah  
 me too  but that is not my confession 
 my confession is this i am a health psychologist and my mission is to help people be happier and
  but i fear
 that something i 've been teaching for the last ten years
 is doing more harm than good  and it has to do with stress 
 for years i 've been telling people stress makes you sick it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease  
 basically i 've turned stress into the enemy  
 but i have changed my mind about stress and today  i want to change yours
 let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress 
 this study tracked thirty thousand adults in the united states for eight years and they started by asking people 
 how much stress have you experienced in the last year 
 they also asked do you believe that stress is harmful for your health
 they used public death records to find out who died 
 okay
  some bad news first  
 people who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a forty three percent increased risk of dying  
 but
 that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health
  people who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die in fact they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study including people who had relatively little stress  
 now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths one hundred and eighty two thousand americans died prematurely not from stress but from the belief
 that stress is bad for you 
 that is over twenty thousand deaths a year  
 now if that estimate is correct 
 that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the united states last year  
 killing more people than skin cancer hiv aids and homicide
  see why this study freaked me out here i 've been spending so much energy telling people
 stress is bad for your health 
 so this study got me wondering can changing how you think about stress make you healthier  and here the science says yes when you change your mind about stress you can change your body
  now to explain how this works  i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out  it 's called the social stress test  
 you come into the laboratory  and you 're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech
 on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you and to make sure you feel the pressure there are bright lights and a camera in your face
  like this and
 the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging non verbal feedback 
 like this 
 now that you 're sufficiently demoralized time for part two a math test and
  unbeknownst to you the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it now we 're going to all do this together  it 's going to be fun 
 for me okay 
 i want you all to count backwards from nine hundred and  ninety six in increments of seven you 're going to do this out loud as
  that guy made a mistake we are going to have to start all over again you
 're not very good at this are you okay 
 so you get the idea  if you were actually in this study you 'd probably be a little stressed out your heart might be pounding you might be breathing faster maybe breaking out into a sweat
 and normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren 't coping very well with the pressure  
 but what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized was preparing you to meet this challenge  
 now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at
  before they went through the social stress test  they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful that pounding heart is preparing you for action 
 if you 're breathing faster  it 's no problem  it 's getting more oxygen to your brain  
 and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance  well they were less stressed out less anxious more confident
  but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed  
 now in a typical stress response  your heart rate goes up  and your blood vessels constrict like this
  and this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease  it 's not really healthy to be in this state all the time 
 but in the study when participants viewed their stress response as helpful their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this
  this 
 their heart was still pounding but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile  it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy
 and courage 
 over a lifetime of stressful experiences this one biological change could be the difference
  heart attack at age fifty and living well into your 
 and this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters 
 so my goal as a health psychologist has changed i no longer want to get rid of your stress  i want to make you better at stress  
 and we just did a little intervention  if you raised your hand and said you 'd had a lot of stress in the last year  we could have saved your life  
  the next time your heart is pounding from stress you 're going to remember this talk and you 're going to think to yourself this is my body helping me rise to this challenge  
 and when you view stress in that way your body believes you and your stress response becomes healthier  
 now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem
  myself from so we are going to do one more intervention  
 i want to tell you about one of the most under appreciated aspects of the stress response  and the idea is this stress makes you social 
 to understand this side of stress we need to talk about a hormone oxytocin 
 and i know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get it even has its own
  cute nickname the cuddle hormone  because it 's released when you hug someone but this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in 
 oxytocin is 
 a neuro hormone it fine tunes your brain 's social instincts  it primes you to do things that strengthen close
  oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family 
 it enhances your empathy  it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about 
 some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin 
 to become more compassionate and caring  but here 's what most people don 't
  it 's a stress hormone  
 your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response it 's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound  
 and when oxytocin is released in the stress response  it is motivating you to seek support  
 your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it
  up  your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling
 so that you can support each other 
 when life is difficult your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you okay
 so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier  well oxytocin doesn 't only act on your brain
 it also acts on your body  
 and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress  it 's a natural
 it also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress but my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart 
 your heart has receptors for this hormone  
 and oxytocin helps
  heart cells regenerate
 and heal from any stress induced damage this stress hormone strengthens your heart  
 and the cool thing is
 is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support 
 so when you reach out to others under stress  either to seek support or to help someone else
 you release more of this hormone  your stress response becomes healthier  and you actually recover faster from stress  
 i find this amazing that your stress response has a built in mechanism for stress resilience  
 and that mechanism is human connection  
 i want to finish by telling you about one more study  and listen up
  up  because this study could also save a life 
 this study tracked about one thousand adults in the united states and they ranged in age from thirty four to ninety three 
 and they started the study by asking how much stress have you experienced in the last year 
 they also asked how much time have you spent helping out friends  neighbors people in your
  community 
 and then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died  
 okay so the bad news first  
 for every major stressful life experience like financial difficulties or family crisis 
 that increased the risk of dying by thirty percent 
 but
 and i hope you are expecting a
  wasn 't true for everyone 
 people who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress related increase in dying zero
  caring created resilience  
 and so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not
  how you think
 and how you act can transform your experience of stress  when you choose to view your stress response as helpful  
 you create the biology of courage  
 and when you choose to connect with others under stress you can create resilience  now
 i wouldn 't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life
 but
 this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress stress gives us access to our hearts 
 the compassionate heart
 that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others 
 and yes  your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength and energy
  and when you choose to view stress in this way you 're not just getting better at stress you 're actually making a pretty profound statement
  you 're saying that you can trust yourself
 to handle life 's challenges  and
 you 're remembering that you don 't have to face them
  kind of amazing what you 're telling us  it seems amazing to me that a belief
 about stress can make so much difference to
 someone 's life expectancy how would that extend to advice like if someone is making a lifestyle choice between say a stressful job
  and a non stressful job does it matter
 which way they go it 's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense km yeah and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is 
  better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort  and so i would say that 's really the best way to make decisions is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows
