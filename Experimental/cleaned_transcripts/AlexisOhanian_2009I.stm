  there are a lot of web two point zero consultants who make a lot of money in fact they make their living
 on this stuff i 'm going to try to save you all the time and money and go through it in the next three minutes so bear with me started a website in two thousand and five with a few friends
  's what you 'd call a social news website basically the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web you find some interesting content say a ted talk submit it to reddit and a community of your 
  peers votes up if they like it down if they don 't that creates the front page it 's always rising falling  a half million people visit every day  but this isn 't about reddit it 's about discovering new things 
  that pop up on the web  in the last four years we 've seen all kinds of memes all kinds of trends get born right on our front page
  it 's actually about humpback whales
 well technically it 's about greenpeace an environmental organization that wanted to stop the japanese government 's whaling campaign the whales were getting killed they wanted to put an end to it 
 one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales but to personify the movement they wanted to name it so in true web fashion they put together a poll where they had a bunch of very erudite very thoughtful cultured names i
 for immortal i think this means divine power of the ocean in a polynesian language and then there was this mister splashy pants 
 and this this was a special name mister pants or splashy to his friends was very popular on the internet in fact someone on reddit thought what a great thing we should all vote this up and
 redditors responded
  all agreed so the voting started  we got behind it ourselves we changed our logo for the day from the alien to splashy to help the cause  and it wasn 't long before other sites like fark and boing 
  boing and the rest of the internet started saying we love splashy pants so it went from about five percent which was when this meme started 
  greenpeace actually wasn 't that crazy about it because they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win they said no just kidding we 'll give it another week of voting 
 well that got us a little angry so we changed it to fightin ' splashy 
 and the reddit community really the rest of the internet really got behind this facebook groups were created facebook applications were created the idea was vote your conscience vote for mister splashy pants 
 people were putting up signs in the real world
  of the landslide the next highest name pulled in three there was a clear lesson the internet loves mister splashy pants which
 is obvious it 's a great name everyone wants to hear their news anchor say mister splashy pants laughter
 i think that 's what helped drive this
 what was cool were the repercussions greenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it mister splashy pants shirts and pins an e card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy
 but even more important was that they accomplished their mission the japanese government called off their whaling expedition mission accomplished greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that 's a quote 
 and actually  redditors in the internet community were happy to participate but they weren 't whale lovers a few certainly but we 're talking about a lot of people  really
  greenpeace came back to the site and thanked reddit for its participation but this wasn 't really altruism just interest in doing something cool this is how the internet works this is that great big secret 
 the internet provides a level playing field your link is as good as your link which is as good as my link with a browser anyone can get to any website no matter your budget  that is as long as you can keep net neutrality in place
 another important thing is it costs nothing to get content online there are so many publishing tools available it only takes a few minutes
  iteration is so cheap you might as well if you do be genuine be honest up front one of the great lessons greenpeace learned is that it 's ok to lose control
 ok to take yourself a little less seriously given that even though it 's a very serious cause  you could ultimately achieve your goal
 that 's the final message i want to share you can do well online but no longer is the message coming from just the top down if you want to succeed you 've got to be ok to lose control
