  fifty percent
 of middle management and professional positions but the percentages of women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of
  so some people hear that statistic and they ask why do we have so few women leaders 
 but i look at that statistic and if you like me  believe that leadership manifests at every level 
 you would see that there 's a tremendous awesome resource of leaders who are leading in middle management
  which raises a different question why are there so many women mired in the middle
 and what has to happen to take them to the top  
 so some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization 
 well tonya is a great example of one of these women i met her
  two years ago she was a vice president in a fortune fifty company  and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration 
 i 've worked really hard to improve my confidence and my assertiveness and develop a great brand 
 i get terrific performance evals from my boss my 
  in the organization let me know that my teams love working for me 
  i 've taken every management course that i can here i am working with a terrific mentor  and yet i 've been passed over
 twice for advancement
 opportunities  even when my manager knows that i 'm committed to moving up and even interested in an international assignment 
 i don 't understand why i 'm being passed over so what tonya doesn 't realize is that there 's a missing
 of the career success equation for women 
 and it 's understanding what this missing thirty three percent is that 's required to close the gender gap at the top 
 in order to move up in organizations you have to be known for your leadership skills and this would apply to any of you 
  means that you have to be recognized for using the greatness in you
 to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others  
 put in other language it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities
 to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others
  inside of the organization and outside 
 and although all three of these elements of leadership are important when it comes to moving up in organizations they aren 't equally important 
 so pay attention to the green box as i move forward 
 in seeking and identifying employees with high potential the potential
  to go to the top of organizations 
 the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership 
 these skills and competencies can be summarized as business
  and financial acumen in other words this skill set has to do with understanding
 where the organization is going what its strategy is 
 what financial targets it has in place and understanding your role in moving the organization forward  
 this is that missing thirty three percent of the career success equation for women 
 not because it 's missing in our capabilities or abilities
 but because it 's missing in the advice that we 're given 
 here 's what i mean by that 
 five years ago i was asked to moderate a panel of executives and the topic for the evening was what do you look for in high potential employees 
 so think about the three elements of leadership as i summarize for you what they told me they said we look for people who are smart
 and hard working and committed and
 trustworthy and resilient so which element of leadership does that relate to 
 personal greatness 
 they said we look for employees who are great with our customers who empower their teams who negotiate effectively who are able to manage conflict well  and are overall
  great communicators 
 which element of leadership does that equate to engaging the greatness in others  
 and then they pretty much stopped  
 so i asked well  what about people who understand your business  where it 's going  and their role in taking it there  
 and what about people who are able to scan the external environment identify
  risks and opportunities make strategy or make strategic recommendations  
 and what about people who are able to look at the financials of your business  understand the story that the financials tell and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations 
 and to a man they said 
 that 's a given
  turned to the audience of one hundred and fifty women and i asked how many of you have ever been told
 that the door opener for career advancement is your business strategic and financial acumen 
 and that all the other important stuff is what differentiates you in the talent pool 
  and i 've asked this question of women all around the globe in the five years since  and the percentage is never much different 
 so this is obvious right  but how can it be 
 well there are primarily three reasons that there 's this missing thirty three percent in the career success advice given to women 
 when organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional
  advice that we 've been hearing for over forty years 
 there 's a notable absence of advice that relates to business strategic and financial acumen  much of the advice is emphasizing 
  personal actions that we need to take like become more assertive become more confident develop your personal brand  
 learn to self promote get a mentor enhance your network and virtually nothing said about the importance of business strategic and financial acumen  
 this doesn 't mean that this advice is unimportant 
 what it means is that this is advice that 's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start
 to middle management
 but it 's not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle where we 're fifty percent to senior and executive positions  
 and this is why conventional advice to women
 in forty years hasn 't closed the gender gap at the top and won 't close it 
 now the second reason relates to tonya 's comments about having had excellent
 performance evals great feedback from her teams  and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on 
 so you would think that she 's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business strategic and financial acumen
  but here again that green square is quite small 
 on average talent and performance management systems in the organizations that i 've worked with
 focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business strategic and financial
  which is why typical
 talent and performance systems haven 't closed and won 't close the gender gap at the top  
 now 
 tonya also talked about working with a mentor  
 and this is really important to talk about because if organizations talent and performance systems aren 't giving people in general information about the importance of
 business strategic and financial acumen how are men getting to the top
 there are primarily two ways one is because of the positions they 're guided into and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship  
 so what 's women 's experience as it relates to mentoring 
 well this
 comment from an executive that i worked with recently illustrates that experience  he was very proud of the fact that last year he had two
 protgs a man and a woman  
 and he said i helped the woman build confidence 
 i helped the man learn the business  and i didn 't realize that i was treating them any differently and he was sincere about that 
 so what this illustrates is that as managers whether we 're women or men
 we have mindsets about women and men about careers in leadership and these unexamined mindsets won 't close the gender gap at the top  
 so how do we take this idea of the missing thirty three percent and turn it into action 
 well for women the answer is obvious we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we 're
 people who understand our businesses
  where they 're headed  and our role in taking it there that 's what enables that breakthrough from
 middle management to leadership at the top  
 but you don 't have to be a middle manager to do this one young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her
 insight about the missing
  to weave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room  
 so we don 't want to put one hundred percent of the responsibility on women 's shoulders  nor would it be wise to do so and here 's why 
 in order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction
 in other words the term we use in business is we have to have strategic alignment  and
 executives know this very well and yet only thirty seven percent according to a recent conference board report believe that they have that strategic alignment in place  
 so for sixty three percent of
  achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable  
 and if you think about what i 've just shared that you have situations where at least fifty percent of your middle managers
 haven 't received clear messaging that they have to become
 focused on the business  where it 's headed  and their role in taking it there it 's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low 
 which is why
 there are other people who have a role to play in this it 's important for directors on boards
 to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions why because if they aren 't seeing that it could be a red
  that their organization isn 't as aligned as it could potentially be it 's important for ceos
 to also expect these proportional pools and if they hear comments like well she doesn 't have enough business experience ask the question what are we going to do about that 
 it 's important for h r executives to make sure that the missing thirty three percent is appropriately emphasized  
 and it 's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine
  the mindsets we hold about women and men about careers and success to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody  
 so let me close with the latest chapter in tonya 's story 
 tonya emailed me two months ago and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position and during the interview they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry  
 and she said that she was so happy
  to report that now she has a new position reporting directly to the chief information officer at her company  
 so for some of you the missing thirty three percent is an idea for you to put into action  
 and i hope that for all of you you will see it as an idea worth spreading
 in order to help organizations be more effective to help women create careers that soar  and to help close the gender gap at the top  thank you
