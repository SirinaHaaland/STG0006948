  here 's a startling fact 
 in the forty five years since the introduction of the automated teller machine those vending machines that dispense cash  
 the number of human bank tellers employed in the united states has roughly doubled from about a quarter of a million
 to a half a million
 nine hundred and seventy to about a half a million today with one hundred thousand added since the year two thousand  
 these facts revealed in a recent book by boston university economist james bessen raise an intriguing question 
 what are all those tellers doing and why hasn 't automation eliminated their employment by now
  if you think about it many of the great inventions of the last two hundred years were designed to replace human labor  
 tractors were developed to substitute mechanical power for human physical toil  
 assembly lines were engineered to replace
 inconsistent human handiwork with machine perfection  computers were programmed
  inconsistent human calculation with digital perfection 
 these inventions have worked  we no longer dig ditches by hand  pound tools out of wrought iron or do bookkeeping using actual books  
 and yet  the fraction of us adults employed in the labor market
 is higher now in two thousand and sixteen than it was one hundred and twenty five years ago in
  and it 's risen in just about every decade in the intervening one hundred and twenty five years 
 this poses a paradox our machines increasingly do our work for us why doesn 't this make our labor redundant and our skills obsolete  
 why are there still so many jobs 
 laughter i 'm going to try to answer that question tonight  and along the way i 'm going to tell you what this means for the future of work
 and the challenges that automation does
 and does not pose for our society  why are there so many jobs 
 there are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake 
 one has to do with human genius and creativity  the other has to do with human 
 or greed if you like i 'm going to call the first of these the  o ring principle and it determines the type of work that we do the second
  principle is the never get enough principle and it determines how many jobs there actually are let 's start with the
 automated teller machines had two countervailing effects on bank teller employment 
 as you would expect they replaced a lot of teller tasks the number of tellers per branch fell by about a third
  banks quickly discovered that it also was cheaper to open new branches and the number of bank branches increased by about forty percent in the same time period  
 the net result was more branches and more tellers  
 but those tellers were doing somewhat different work 
 as their routine cash handling tasks receded they became less like checkout clerks and more like salespeople
  forging relationships with customers  solving problems and introducing them to new products like credit cards  loans and investments more tellers doing a more cognitively demanding job  
 there 's a general principle here most of the work that we do requires a multiplicity of skills 
 and
 brains and brawn  technical
  perspiration and inspiration in the words of thomas edison  
 in general  automating some subset of those tasks doesn 't make the other ones unnecessary  in fact  it makes them more important  
 it increases their economic value  let me give you a stark example in one thousand nine hundred and 
 the space shuttle challenger exploded and
 crashed back down to earth less than two minutes after takeoff  
 the cause of that crash it turned out was an inexpensive rubber  o ring in the booster rocket that had frozen on the launchpad the night before and 
  failed catastrophically moments after takeoff  in this multibillion dollar enterprise that simple rubber  o ring made the difference between mission success and the calamitous death of seven astronauts 
 tragic setting is the  o ring production function named by harvard economist michael kremer after the challenger disaster 
 the o ring production function conceives of the work as a series of interlocking steps links in a chain  every one of those links must hold for the mission to succeed if any of them fails
  the mission or the product or the service  comes crashing down 
 this precarious situation has a surprisingly positive implication 
 which is that improvements in the reliability of any one link in the chain increases the value of improving any of the other links 
 concretely  
 if most of the links are brittle and prone to breakage the fact that your link is not that reliable is not that important  probably something else will break anyway but
  as all the other links become robust and reliable the importance of your link becomes more essential in the limit everything depends upon it 
 the reason the o ring was critical to space shuttle challenger is because everything else worked perfectly 
 if the challenger were kind of the space era equivalent of microsoft windows two thousand
  reliability of the o ring wouldn 't have mattered because the machine would have crashed 
 here 's the broader point  
 in much of the work that we do we are the  o rings 
 yes  atms could do certain  cash handling tasks faster and better than tellers  
 but that didn 't make tellers superfluous  it increased the importance of their
  relationships with customers  
 the same principle applies if we 're building a building if we 're diagnosing and caring for a patient or if we are teaching a class
 to a roomful of high schoolers
  as our tools improve  technology magnifies our leverage and increases the importance of our expertise and our judgment and our creativity
  and that brings me to the second principle never get enough  
 you may be thinking ok  o ring got it that says the jobs that people do will be important they can 't be done by machines but they still need to be done but that doesn 't tell me how many jobs there will need to be 
 if you think about it  isn 't it kind of self evident that once we get sufficiently productive at something we 've basically worked our way out of a job
  percent of all us employment was on farms today  it 's less than two percent why are there so few farmers today  
 it 's not because we 're eating less 
 a century of productivity growth in farming means that now a couple of million farmers can feed a nation of three hundred and twenty million that 's
  but it also means there are only so many o ring jobs left in farming so clearly technology can eliminate jobs farming is only one example there are many others like it  
 but what 's true about a single product or service or industry has never been true about the economy as a whole many of the industries in which we now work
 health and medicine  
  electronics and computing
 were tiny or barely existent a century ago many of the products that we spend a lot of our money on
 air conditioners sport utility vehicles computers and mobile devices were unattainably expensive or just hadn 't been invented a century ago 
 as automation frees our time increases the scope of what is possible we invent new products new ideas new services that command our attention occupy our time
 and spur consumption 
 you may think some of these things are frivolous extreme yoga  adventure tourism pokmon go and i might agree with you 
 but people desire these things and they 're willing to work hard for them the average worker in two thousand and fifteen wanting to attain the average living standard in one
  and fifteen could do so by working just seventeen weeks a year one third of the time  
 but most people don 't choose to do that they are willing to work hard to harvest the technological bounty that is available to them 
 material abundance has never eliminated perceived scarcity in the words of economist thorstein veblen  
 invention is the mother of necessity
  so if you accept these two principles the  o ring principle and the never get enough principle  then you agree with me there will be jobs 
 does that mean there 's nothing to worry about automation employment robots and jobs it 'll all take care of itself 
 no 
 that is not my argument automation
 creates wealth
 by allowing us to do more work in less time there is no economic law that says that we will use that wealth well and that is worth worrying about 
 consider two countries  norway and saudi arabia 
 both oil rich nations  it 's like they have money spurting out of a hole in the ground 
 but they haven 't used that wealth equally well to foster human
  a thriving democracy by and large its citizens work and play well together  
 it 's typically numbered between first and fourth in rankings of national happiness  
 saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy in which many citizens lack a path for personal advancement it 's typically ranked 
 among nations in happiness which is low for such a wealthy nation just by way of comparison the us is typically ranked around
 the difference between these two countries is not their wealth and it 's not their technology  it 's their institutions  
 norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility  saudi arabia has raised living standards while frustrating many other human strivings
  both wealthy not equally well off and this brings me to the challenge that we face today
 the challenge that automation poses for us the challenge is not that we 're running out of work the us has added fourteen million jobs since the depths of the great recession  
 the challenge is that many of those jobs are not good jobs and many citizens cannot qualify for the good jobs that are being created 
 employment growth in the united states and in much
  much of the developed world looks something like a barbell with increasing poundage on either end of the bar on the one hand  you 
  jobs like doctors and nurses
  programmers and engineers  marketing and sales managers employment is robust in these jobs employment growth similarly employment
  clerical and sales positions  the reasons behind
  rules and procedures that can
 increasingly be codified in software and executed executed by computers  
 the challenge that this phenomenon creates creates what economists call employment polarization is that it knocks out rungs in the economic ladder  shrinks the size of the middle 
  class and threatens to make us a more stratified society  on the one hand a set of highly paid
  educated professionals doing interesting work on the other a large number of citizens in low paid jobs whose primary responsibility is to see to the comfort and health of the affluent 
 that is not my vision of progress  and i doubt that it is yours  
 but here is some encouraging news  we have faced
  automation was eliminating vast numbers of agricultural jobs remember that tractor  
 the farm states faced a threat of mass unemployment a generation of youth no longer needed on the farm
  rising to this challenge they took the radical step of requiring that their entire youth population remain in school and continue their education to the ripe old age of sixteen 
 this was called the high school movement  and it was a radically expensive thing to do not only did they have to invest in the schools  but those kids couldn 't work at their jobs 
  it also turned out to be one of the best investments the us made in the 20th century it gave us the most skilled
  skilled the most flexible and the most productive workforce in the world to see how well this worked  imagine taking the labor force of
 and ninety nine and bringing them into the present  
 despite their strong backs and good characters many of them would lack the basic literacy and numeracy skills to do all but the most mundane mundane jobs
  many of them would be unemployable 
 what this example highlights is the primacy of our institutions most especially our schools in allowing us to reap the harvest of our technological prosperity  
 it 's foolish to say there 's nothing to worry about clearly we can get this wrong  
 if the us had not invested in its schools and in its skills a century ago with the high school movement
  be a less prosperous a less mobile and probably a lot less happy society  
 but it 's equally foolish to say that our fates are sealed that 's not decided by the machines  it 's not even decided by the market it 's decided by us and by our institutions  
 now  i started this talk with a paradox our machines increasingly do our work for us why doesn 't that make our labor superfluous our skills redundant isn 't it obvious that the road to our economic and social hell is paved with our own great inventions
 history has repeatedly offered an answer to that paradox  the first part of the answer is that technology magnifies our leverage increases the importance 
 the added value of our expertise our judgment and our creativity 
  to do  
 adjusting to the rapid pace of technological change creates real challenges  seen most clearly in our polarized labor market and the threat that it poses to economic mobility  
 rising to this challenge is not automatic  
 it 's not costless  it 's not easy  but it is feasible  and here is some encouraging news because of our amazing productivity
 're rich of course we can afford to invest in ourselves and in our children as america did a hundred years ago with the high school movement  
 arguably we can 't afford not to 
 now you may be thinking  professor autor has told us a heartwarming tale about the distant past  the recent past  maybe the present
  probably not the future because everybody knows that this time is different  right is this time different 
 of course this time is different  
 every time is different 
 on numerous occasions in the last two hundred years scholars and activists have raised the alarm that we are running out of work and making ourselves obsolete for example  the luddites
  and of course many scholars pundits  technologists and media figures today  
 these predictions strike me as arrogant 
  oracles are in effect saying if i can 't think of what people will do for work in the future  then you me and our kids aren 't going to think of it either 
 i don 't have the guts to take that bet against human ingenuity  
 look i can 't tell you what people are going to do for work a hundred years from now  
 but the future doesn 't hinge on my imagination
  if i were a farmer in iowa in the year one thousand nine hundred and an economist from the 21st century teleported down to my field
 and said hey guess what farmer autor 
 in the next hundred years agricultural employment is going to fall from forty percent of all jobs to two percent
 purely due to rising productivity what do you think the other thirty eight percent of workers are going to do 
  i wouldn 't have had a clue  
 but i hope i would have had the wisdom to say 
 wow a ninety five percent reduction in farm employment with no shortage of food 
 that 's an amazing amount of progress  i hope that humanity finds something remarkable to do with all of that prosperity
  and by and large  i would say that it has thank you very much
