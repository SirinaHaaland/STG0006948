  a while ago i tried an experiment for one year  i would say yes to all the things that scared me  
 anything that made me nervous took me out of my comfort zone  i forced myself to say yes to did i want to speak in public
 did i want to be on live tv  no  but yes  did i want to try acting no no no but yes yes yes  
 and a crazy thing happened  the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear 
 made it not scary  my fear of public speaking my social anxiety 
  but there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way in a
 way i never imagined  and it started with a question from my toddler 
 i have these three amazing daughters harper beckett and emerson and emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as honey as though she 's a southern waitress
  honey i 'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup 
 the southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when i was on my way somewhere and i said yes 
 and that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family  
 i made a vow that from now on every time one of my children asks me to play no matter what i 'm doing or where i 'm going i say yes 
 every single time
  time  
 almost i 'm not perfect at it but i try hard to practice it and it 's had a magical effect on me  on my children on our family  
 but it 's also had a stunning side effect and it wasn 't until recently that i fully understood it that i understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career  
 see i have what most people would
  call a dream job  i 'm a writer i imagine i make stuff up for a living dream job  no  i 'm a titan  
 dream job  
 i create television i executive produce television i make television a great deal of television 
 in one way or another this tv season i 'm responsible for bringing about seventy hours of programming to the world  four television programs seventy hours of tv
  production at a time sometimes four  
 each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn 't exist before the budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars let 's just say five 
 a new episode made every nine days times four shows so every nine days that 's twenty million dollars worth of television four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time 
  seventy hours of tv that 's three hundred and fifty million dollars for a season 
 in america  my television shows are back to back to back on thursday night around the world my shows air in two hundred and fifty six territories in sixty seven languages for an audience of thirty million people my brain is global 
 and forty five hours of that seventy hours of tv are shows i personally created and not just produced so on top of everything else i need to
  find time  real quiet creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories  
 four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time sometimes four  three hundred and fifty million dollars campfires burning all over the world  
 you know who else is doing that 
 nobody  so like i said i 'm a titan
  i don 't tell you this to impress you i tell you this because i know what you think of when you hear the word writer 
 i tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home  
 take me seriously when i talk about working so you 'll get that i don 't peck at a computer and imagine all day 
 so you 'll hear me when i say that i understand that a dream job is not about
  dreaming 
 it 's all job 
 all work all reality all blood all sweat no tears i work a lot very hard  and i love it  
 when i 'm hard at work when i 'm deep in it there is no other feeling 
 for me my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air  it is manning the troops it is painting a canvas it is hitting every high note it is running a marathon it is being
 beyonc and it is all of those things at the same time 
 i love working  
 it is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious  and what makes it all so good is the hum  
 there is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets
  a hum begins in my brain and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road and i could drive it forever 
 and a lot of people when i try to explain the hum  
 they assume that i 'm talking about the writing  that my writing brings me joy and don 't get me wrong  it does but the hum
 it wasn 't until i started making television that i started working working and making and building and creating and collaborating that i discovered this thing
  this buzz this rush this hum  
 the hum is more than writing  
 the hum is action and activity the hum is a drug  the hum is music the hum is light and air the hum is god 's whisper right in my ear  
 and when you have a hum like that you can 't help but strive for greatness
  you can 't help but strive for greatness at any cost  that 's called the hum  or maybe it 's called being a workaholic 
 maybe it 's called genius maybe it 's called ego maybe it 's just fear of failure  
 i don 't know i just know that
 i 'm not built for failure  and i just know that i love the hum
  just know that i want to tell you i 'm a titan and i know that i don 't want to question it  but here 's the thing  
 the more successful i become  the more shows the more episodes the more barriers broken  the more work there is to do  
 the more balls in the air  the more eyes on me  the more history stares the more expectations
  the more i work to be successful  the more i need to work 
 and what did i say about work  i love working right  
 the nation i 'm building the marathon i 'm running the troops the canvas the high note the hum  the hum  the hum  
 i like that hum i love that hum  i need that hum  i am that hum  
 am i nothing but that hum  
 and then the hum stopped
  overdone burned out the hum
 stopped now my three daughters
 are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan  harper tells people my mom won 't be there but you can text my nanny 
 and emerson says honey  i 'm wanting to go to shondaland 
 they 're children of a titan they 're baby titans they were twelve three
  and one when the hum stopped  
 the hum of the engine died i stopped loving work i couldn 't restart the engine the hum would not come back my hum
 was broken  
 i was doing the same things i always did all the same titan work 15 hour days working straight through the weekends no regrets never surrender a titan never sleeps a titan never quits full hearts clear eyes
  but there was no hum  inside me was silence  
 four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time sometimes four four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time   i was the perfect titan 
 i was a titan you could take home to your mother 
 all the colors were the same and i was no longer having any fun  and it was
  my life 
 it was all i did i was the hum  and the hum was me  
 so what do you do when the thing you do the work you love starts to taste like dust 
 now i know somebody 's out there thinking cry me a river stupid writer titan lady 
 but you know
  if you make if you work  if you love what you do being a teacher being a banker being a mother being a painter being bill gates  if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum 
  if you know the hum  if you know what the hum feels like if you have been to the hum  when the hum stops 
  play can i survive in the silence  
 and then my southern waitress toddler asks me a question 
 i 'm on my way out the door i 'm late  and she says momma  wanna play 
 and i 'm just about to say no when i realize two things one i 'm supposed to say yes to everything and two my southern waitress didn 't call me
 she 's not calling everyone honey anymore 
 when did that happen  i 'm missing it  being a titan and mourning my hum and here she is changing right before my eyes 
 and so she says momma  wanna play and i say yes 
 there 's
 nothing special about it we play and we 're joined by her sisters and there 's a lot of laughing and
  i give a dramatic reading from the book everybody poops nothing out of the ordinary 
 and yet  
 it is extraordinary because in my pain and my panic in the homelessness of my humlessness i have nothing to do but pay attention 
 i focus i am still 
 the nation i 'm
  the marathon i 'm running the troops the canvas the high note does not exist 
 all that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that frozen girl needs to let go of it 's all peace
 and simplicity 
 the air is so rare in this place for me that i can barely breathe i can barely believe i 'm breathing play is the opposite of
  work 
 and i am happy something in me loosens a door in my brain swings open 
 and a rush of energy comes and it 's not instantaneous but it happens  it does happen i feel it 
 a hum creeps back not at full volume barely there it 's quiet and i have to stay very still to hear it but it is there not the hum
  but a hum  and now i feel like i know a very magical secret  
 well  let 's not get carried away  it 's just love that 's all it is 
 no magic  no secret it 's just love it 's
 just something we forgot 
 the hum  the work hum the hum of the titan  that 's just a replacement  if i have to ask
  you who i am  if i have to tell you who i am if i describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is 
 i have forgotten what the real hum is 
 the hum is not power and the hum is not
  excited by life the real hum is confidence and peace  the real hum ignores the stare of history and the balls in the air and the expectation and the pressure  the real hum is singular and original  
 the real hum is god 's whisper in my ear but maybe god was whispering the wrong words because which one of the gods was telling me i was the titan  
 it 's just love  we could all use a little more love
  love a lot more love 
 any time my child asks me to play  i will say yes  
 i make it a firm rule for one reason to give myself permission to free me from all of my workaholic guilt  
 it 's a law so i don 't have a choice  and i don 't have a choice not if i want to feel the hum
  i wish it were that easy but i 'm not good at playing i don 't like it  
 i 'm not interested in doing it the way i 'm interested in doing work 
 the truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face i don 't like playing i work all the time because i like working i like working more
 than i like
 being at home facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle because
 what kind of person
 likes working more than being at home  
 well me i mean  let 's be honest i call myself a titan  i 've got issues 
 laughter and one of those issues isn 't that i am too relaxed
  we run around the yard up and back and up and back
 we have 30 second dance parties  we sing show tunes we play with balls 
 i blow bubbles and they pop them  and i feel stiff and delirious and confused
 most of the time 
 i itch for my cell phone always  
 but it is ok  my tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up i
  play and i play until i begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place  
 you can do it too say yes every time your child asks you to play  
 are you thinking that maybe i 'm an idiot in diamond shoes you 're right  but you can still do this you have time  
  you know why because you 're not rihanna and you 're not a muppet your child does not think you 're that interesting 
 you only need fifteen minutes my two and four year old only ever want to play with me for about fifteen minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else
  it 's an amazing fifteen minutes but it 's fifteen minutes if i 'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy i 'm invisible after fifteen minutes 
  i can get a 13 year old to talk to me for fifteen minutes
 i 'm parent of the year 
 fifteen minutes is all you need i can totally pull off fifteen minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day 
 uninterrupted is the key  no cell phone no laundry no anything 
 you have a busy life you have to get dinner on the table you have to force them to bathe but you can do fifteen minutes
  my kids are my happy place they 're my world but it doesn 't have to be your kids  the fuel that feeds your hum the place where life feels more good than not good it
 's not about playing with your kids  it 's about joy  it 's about playing in general 
 give yourself the fifteen minutes find what makes you feel good just figure it out and play in that arena
  not perfect at it in fact i fail as often as i succeed  seeing friends reading books staring into space 
 wanna play starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways i 'd given up on right around the time i got my first tv show right around the time i became a 
 right around the time i started competing with myself for ways unknown 
 fifteen minutes what could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for fifteen minutes  turns out nothing
 the very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return as if the hum 's engine could only refuel while i was away 
 work doesn 't work without play  
 it takes a little time  but after a few months 
 one day the floodgates open and there 's a rush  and i find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody full on groove
  inside me and around me and it sends me spinning with ideas and the humming road is open and i can drive it and drive it and i love working again 
 but now 
 i like that hum but i don 't love that hum  i don 't need that hum  i am not that hum that hum is not me  not anymore  
 i am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends  i am that hum
  hum love 's hum work 's hum is still a piece of me it is just no longer all of me  and i am so grateful  
 and i don 't give a crap about being a titan because i have never once seen a titan play red rover red rover
  i said yes to less work and more play and somehow i still run my world  my brain is still global my campfires still burn  the more i play
  happier i am and the happier my kids are  
 the more i play  
 the more i feel like a good mother  the more i play the freer my mind becomes the more i play the better i work  the more i play the more i feel the hum  
 the nation i 'm building the marathon i 'm running the troops the canvas the high note the hum the hum  the other hum  the real
  life 's hum  
 the more i feel that hum the more this strange  quivering  uncocooned awkward brand new alive non titan feels like me  
 the more i feel that hum the more i know who i am i 'm a writer  i make stuff up i imagine  
 that part of the job that 's living the dream  that 's the dream of the job  
 because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy i said yes to less work and more play  
 titans need not apply  wanna play  thank you
