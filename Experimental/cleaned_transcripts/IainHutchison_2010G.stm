  our face
 is hugely important because it 's the external visual part that everybody else sees  
 let 's not forget it 's a functional entity we have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our
  it 's where our senses are located our special senses our vision our speech our hearing our smell our taste and
 this
 bone is peppered as you can see with the light shining through the skull with cavities the sinuses  which warm and moisten the air we breathe but also imagine 
 if they were filled with solid bone our head would be dead weight  we wouldn 't be able to hold it erect  we wouldn 't be able to look at the world around us
 this woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can 't breathe and eat  attached to the facial bones that define
 our face 's structure
 are the muscles that deliver our facial expression our universal language
 of expression  our social signaling system and overlying this is the skin drape  which is a hugely complex three dimensional structure
 taking right angled bends here and there having thin areas like the eyelids thick areas like the cheek  different colors  and then
 we have the sensual factor of the face where do we like to kiss people on the lips  nibble the
  ears maybe it 's
 the face where we 're attracted to with that 
 but let 's not forget the hair you 're looking at the image on your left hand side that 's my son with his eyebrows present look how odd he looks
 with the eyebrows missing there 's a definite difference and imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose he 'd look even odder still dysmorphophobia
 is an extreme version
 of the fact that we
  't see ourselves as others see us  it 's a shocking truth
 that we only see mirror images of ourselves and we only see ourselves in freeze frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live 
 dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this
 where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct
 their facial appearance  
 they don 't need this they need psychiatric help 
 max has kindly donated his photograph to me he doesn 't have dysmorphophobia  but i 'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic in other words  he looks entirely normal 
 age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes
  so children
 judge themselves learn to judge themselves  by the behavior of adults around them 
 here 's a classic example rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that 's growing out through her skull has obliterated her nose  and she 's having difficulty seeing as you can see it 's blocking her vision she 's also
 in danger when she damages this of bleeding profusely  
 our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them they 've grown used to their face they think they 're special
  actually sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed and occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they 've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don 't recognize them but other adults
 say incredibly painful things they say how dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people
  you be doing something about this why haven 't you had it removed 
 and other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion because a natural curiosity  and that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature 
 after surgery  everything normalizes the adults behave more naturally and the children play more readily with other children 
 as teenagers
 just think back to your teenage years we 're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial
  appearance  
 we 're trying to struggle to find our identity we crave the approval of our peers so our facial appearance is vital to us as we 're trying to project ourselves to the world 
 just remember that single acne spot that crippled you
 for several days how long did you spend looking in the mirror every day  practicing your
 sardonic look practicing your serious look trying to look like sean connery as i did trying to raise one eyebrow
 it 's a crippling time i 've chosen to show this profile view of sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward i 'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward  
 turn to the person next to you push your lower jaws forward turn to the person next to you and look at them they look miserable that 's exactly what people used to say to
  wasn 't miserable at all but people used to say to her why are you so miserable people were making misjudgments
 all the time on her mood 
 teachers and peers were underestimating her she was teased at school so she chose to have facial surgery  
 after the facial surgery  she said my face now reflects my personality people know now that i 'm enthusiastic that i 'm a happy person
 and that 's the change that can be achieved
 for teenagers 
 is this change though a real change or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves well we studied teenagers ' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery and what we found was
 we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn 't recognize the before and after what we found was that the patients were regarded
  as being more attractive after the surgery well that 's not surprising but we also asked them to judge them on honesty intelligence  
 friendliness violence they were all perceived as being
 less than normal in all those characteristics more violent etc before the surgery after the surgery  they were perceived as being more intelligent
  less violent
 and yet we hadn 't operated on their intellect or their character 
 when people get older  they don 't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery  
 their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune what happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma so this is a photograph 
  of henry  two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face his cheekbone his upper
  jaw his eye socket he looks pretty good at this stage  
 but over the course of the next fifteen years he had fourteen more operations as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly 
 i learned a huge amount from henry  henry taught me that you can carry on working  he worked as an advocate  
 he continued to play cricket he enjoyed life to the full and this was probably because he had a successful fulfilling job and a caring family
 and was able to participate socially 
 he maintained a calm insouciance i don 't say he overcame this he didn 't overcome it this was something more than that he ignored it 
 he ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it  
 and that 's what these people can do henriapi
  illustrates this phenomenon as well  this is a man in his  20s whose first visit out of nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the united kingdom to have operated on it was my longest operation 
 it took twenty three hours i did it with my neurosurgeon we removed all the bones at the right side of his face his eye his nose the skull bones the facial skin and reconstructed him with tissue from the back  
  he had a son called jeremiah  and again  he said this painting of me with my son jeremiah shows me as the successful man that i feel that i am 
 his facial disfigurement
 did not affect him because he had the support of a family he had a successful fulfilling job  so
 we 've seen that we can change people 's faces but when we change people 's faces are we changing their identity
 for better or for worse for instance there are two
 different types of facial surgery we can categorize it like that we can say there are patients
 who choose to have facial surgery like sue when they have facial surgery  they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them
 as as better people they don 't feel different they feel
  that they 've actually gained
 what they never had that their face now reflects their personality  and actually that 's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery because you might say 
 well this type of
 surgery might be regarded as cosmetic if you do cosmetic surgery patients are often less happy they 're trying to achieve difference in their lives  
 sue wasn 't trying to achieve difference in her life she was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality
 but then we have other people who don 't choose to have facial surgery they
 're people who have their face shot off i 'll move it off and we 'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you 
 they have it forced upon them  and again as i told you if they have a caring family and
 good work life then they can lead normal
 fulfilled lives their identity doesn 't change 
 is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a western phenomenon  muzetta 's family give the lie to this  
 this is a little bangladeshi girl from the east end of london who 's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly 
 after she had surgery to remove the tumor her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress a pink ribbon in her hair
  and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world  despite the fact that they were orthodox muslims and the mother wore a full burqa  
 so it 's not simply a western phenomenon  
 we make judgments
 on people 's faces all the time 
 it 's been going on since we can think of lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces he said you could see criminal faces judging them just on
  the photographs that were showed good looking people are always judged as being more friendly  we look at
  a good looking guy we 'd like to spend time with him he looks friendly now we know
 that he 's a convicted wife batterer and actually he 's not the good guy  and beauty doesn 't equate
  to goodness and certainly doesn 't equate to contentment  
 so we 've talked about the static face and judging the static face but actually 
 we 're more comfortable with judging the moving face  we think we can judge people on their expressions u k jurors in the u k justice system
 like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity the blink the
  so they want to see live witnesses todorov tells us that in a tenth of a second we can make a judgment
 on somebody 's face 
 are we uncomfortable with this image yes we are would we be happy if our doctor 's face our lawyer 's face our financial adviser 's face was covered 
 we 'd be pretty uncomfortable but are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement the truth is that there 's a
  you spend five minutes with somebody you start looking beyond their facial appearance and the people who you 're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them and the people who you didn 't immediately seek out 
 because you didn 't find them particularly attractive become attractive people because of their personality  
 so we 've talked a lot about facial appearance  i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we
  do where we 're at and where we 're going  
 this is an image of ann who 's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed and you can see in the images afterward we 've managed to reconstruct her successfully  but that 's not good enough  this is what ann wants she wants to be out kayaking she wants to be out climbing mountains and that 's what she achieved  
 and that 's what we have to get to this is a horrific image so i 'm putting my hand up now this is a photograph of adi a nigerian bank manager who
  had his face shot off in an armed robbery and he lost his lower jaw his lip his chin and his upper jaw and teeth this is the bar that he set for us i want to look like this  this is how i looked before 
 so with modern technology we used computers to make models  we made a model of the jaw without bone in it we then bent a plate up to it 
 we put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position  we then
 put bone and tissue from the back  here you can see the plate holding it and you can see the implants being put in so that in one operation
 we achieve
 this
 and this  so the patient 's life is restored that 's the good news however his chin skin
 doesn 't look the same as it did before it 's skin from his back it 's thicker  it 's darker
  it 's coarser  it doesn 't have the contours  and that 's where we 're failing  and that 's where we need the face transplant the face transplant has a role
 probably in burns patients to replace the skin we can replace the underlying skeletal structure but we 're still not good at replacing the facial skin so
 it 's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium  but
 the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives
  what does that mean they have an increased risk of infection an increased risk of malignancy  this is not a life saving transplant like a heart or liver  or lung transplant
 it is a quality of life transplant 
 and as a result 
 are the patients going to say  if they get a malignant cancer ten or fifteen years on i wish i 'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because i 'm now dying of a malignant cancer we don 't know yet 
 we also don 't know
 what they feel about recognition and identity  bernard devauchelle and sylvie testelin who did the first operation are studying that 
 donors are going to be short on the ground because how many people want to have their loved one 's face removed at the point of death
  so there are going to be problems with face
  so the better news is
 the future 's almost here and the future is tissue engineering 
 just imagine 
 i can make a biologically degradable template  
 i can put it in place where it 's meant to be i can sprinkle a few cells stem cells from the patient 's own hip a little bit of genetically engineered protein and
 lo and behold leave it for four months and the face is grown this is a bit like a julia child recipe
  still got problems we 've got mouth cancer to solve  we 're still not curing enough patients it 's the most disfiguring cancer we 're still not reconstructing them well enough 
 in the  u k we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people we still can 't get rid of scars we need to do research  
 and the best news of all
 is that surgeons
  that we need to do research and we 've set up charities that will help us
 fund
 the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future so we don 't just sit on our laurels and say okay we 're doing okay  let 's leave it as it is thank you very much indeed
