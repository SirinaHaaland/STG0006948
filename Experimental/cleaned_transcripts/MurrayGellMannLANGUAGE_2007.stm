  i 'm involved in other things besides physics in fact mostly now in other things one thing is distant relationships among human languages
 and the professional historical linguists in the us and in western europe mostly
  try to stay away from any long distance relationships
 big groupings groupings that go back
 a long time longer than the familiar families
 they don 't like that they think it 's crank i don 't think it 's crank
 and there are some brilliant linguists mostly russians who are working on that at santa fe institute and in moscow
 and i would love to see where that leads
  leads does it really lead to a single ancestor
 some
 twenty twenty five thousand years ago and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor
 when there was presumably a competition among many
 languages how far back does that go how far back does modern language go how many tens of thousands of years does it go back
 do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is murray gell mann well i would guess that
 that modern language must be older
 than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the in the soft clay in the caves in western europe in the aurignacian period some
 thirty five thousand years ago or earlier
 i can 't believe they did all those things and didn 't also have a modern language so i would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further
  but that doesn 't mean that all or many or most of today 's attested languages couldn 't descend perhaps from one that 's much younger than that like say twenty thousand years or something of that kind it 's what we call a bottleneck
 well philip anderson may have been right you may just know more about everything than anyone so it 's been an honor thank you
