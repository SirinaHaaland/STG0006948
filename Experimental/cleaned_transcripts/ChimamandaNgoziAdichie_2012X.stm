  so i would like to start
 by telling you about one of my greatest friends  okoloma maduewesi 
 okoloma lived on my street and looked after me like a big brother  if i liked a boy i would ask okoloma 's opinion  
 okoloma died in the notorious
 sosoliso plane crash
 in nigeria in december of two thousand and five  almost exactly seven years ago  
 okoloma was a person i could argue with laugh with and truly talk to 
 he was also the first person to call me a feminist 
 i was about fourteen we were at his house arguing both of us bristling with half bit knowledge from books that we had read
 i don 't remember what this particular argument was about  
 but i remember that as i argued and argued okoloma looked at me and said you know you 're a feminist it was not a compliment 
 i could tell from his tone the same tone that you would use to say something like you 're a supporter of terrorism 
 i did not know exactly what this word
  meant  and i did not want okoloma to know that i did not know 
 so i brushed it aside and i continued to argue and the first thing i planned to do when i got home was to look up the word feminist in the dictionary 
 now fast forward to
 some years later  i wrote a novel
 about a man who among other things beats his wife and whose story doesn 't end very well while i was promoting the novel in nigeria a journalist
  a nice well meaning man  told me he wanted to advise me 
 and for the nigerians here i 'm sure we 're all familiar with
 how quick our people are to give unsolicited advice 
 he told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist and his advice to me and he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke
  was that i should never call myself a feminist because feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands 
 so i decided to call myself a happy feminist 
 then an academic a nigerian woman
 told me that feminism was not our culture and that feminism
  and that i was calling myself a feminist because i had been corrupted by western books 
 which amused me because a lot of my early readings were decidedly unfeminist i think i must have read every single mills & boon romance published before i was sixteen 
 and each time i tried to read those books called the feminist classics i 'd get bored  
 and i really struggled to finish them but anyway since feminism was un african i decided that i would now call myself a happy african feminist
  at some point i was a happy african feminist who does not hate men and who likes lip gloss and who wears high heels for herself but not for men 
 of course a lot of this was
 that word feminist is so heavy with baggage  negative baggage  you hate men  you hate bras  you hate african culture that sort of thing 
 now here 's a story from my childhood
  when i was in primary school my teacher said at the beginning of term that she would give the class a test
 and whoever got the highest score would be the class monitor  now class monitor was a big deal  
 if you were a class monitor  you got to write down the names of noisemakers 
 which was having enough power of
  my teacher would also give you a cane to hold in your hand
 while you walk around and patrol the class for noisemakers now of course you were not actually allowed to use the cane  
 but it was an exciting prospect for the nine year old me  i very much wanted to be the class monitor  and i got the highest score on the test 
 then to my surprise my teacher said that the monitor
  she had forgotten to make that clear earlier because she assumed it was obvious 
 a boy had the second highest score on the test and he
 would be monitor  now what was even more interesting about this is that
 the boy was a sweet gentle soul who had no interest in patrolling the class with the cane
  male and so he became the class monitor  
 and i 've never forgotten that incident  
 i often make the mistake of thinking that something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone else now take my dear friend louis for example 
 louis is a brilliant progressive man and we would have conversations and he would tell me i don 't know what you mean by things being different or harder for women 
 maybe in the past but not now
 and i didn 't understand how louis could not see what seems so  self evident then one evening 
 in lagos louis and i went out with friends  and for people here who are not familiar with lagos there 's that wonderful lagos ' fixture  
 the sprinkling of energetic men who hang around outside establishments and very dramatically
  you park your car i was impressed with the particular theatrics
 of the man who found us a parking spot that evening  and so as we were leaving i decided to leave him a tip  
 i opened my bag  put my hand inside my bag  brought out my money that i had earned from doing my work and i gave it to the man 
 and he this man who was very
  why is he thanking me  i didn 't give him the money then i saw realization dawn on louis ' face 
 the man believed that whatever money i had
 had ultimately
  come from louis because louis is a man
 men and women are different we have different hormones we have different sexual organs we have different biological abilities 
 women can have babies men can 't at
 least not yet 
 men have testosterone and are in general physically stronger than women there 's slightly more women than men in the world
 about fifty two percent of the world 's population is female but most of the positions of power and prestige are occupied by men  
 the late kenyan nobel peace laureate  wangari maathai  put it simply and well when she said 
 the higher you go the fewer women there are 
 in the recent us elections
 we kept hearing of the lilly ledbetter law  
 and if we go beyond the nicely alliterative name of that law  it was really about a man and a woman doing the same job being equally qualified 
 and the man being paid more because he 's a man  
 so in the literal way men rule the world  and this made sense a thousand years ago
 because human beings lived then in a world in which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival the physically
  person was more likely to lead and men in general are physically stronger of course there are many exceptions 
 but today we live in a vastly different world  
 the person more likely to lead is not the physically stronger person it is the more
  more intelligent person the more innovative person 
 and there are no hormones for those attributes a man is as likely as a woman to be intelligent to be creative to be innovative 
 we have evolved  but it seems to me that our ideas of gender had not evolved  
 some weeks ago i walked into a lobby of one of the best nigerian hotels i thought about naming the hotel but i thought i probably shouldn 't and
 a guard at the entrance stopped me and asked me annoying questions
 because their automatic assumption is that a nigerian female walking into a hotel alone is a sex worker  
 and by the way why do these hotels focus on
 the ostensible supply rather than the demand for sex workers  in lagos i cannot go alone into many reputable
  bars and clubs they just don 't let you in if you 're a woman alone you have to be accompanied by a man  
 each time i walk into a nigerian restaurant with a man  the waiter greets the man and ignores me  
 the waiters are products 
 at this some women felt like yes i thought that the waiters are products of a society that has taught them
 that men are more important than women and i know that waiters don 't intend any harm  but it 's one thing to know intellectually
  and quite another to feel it emotionally each time they ignore me i feel invisible  i feel upset 
 i want to tell them that i am just as human as the man that i 'm just as worthy of acknowledgment  
 these are little things but sometimes it 's the little things that sting the most 
 and not long ago i wrote an article about what it means to be young and female in lagos and
  me it was so angry of course it was angry 
 i am angry  
 gender as it functions today is a grave injustice we should all be angry  anger has a long history of bringing about positive change 
 but in
  addition to being angry i 'm also hopeful because i believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better 
 gender matters everywhere in the world  but i want to focus on nigeria
 and on africa in general because it is where i know and because it is where my heart is  and i would like today to ask that we begin to dream about and plan for
 a different world a
  a world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves  and this is how to start we must raise our daughters differently  
 we must also raise our sons differently  
 we do a great disservice to boys on how we raise them we stifle the humanity of boys 
 we define masculinity in a very narrow way  masculinity becomes this hard small cage and we put boys inside the cage
  teach boys to be afraid of fear  we teach boys to be afraid of weakness of vulnerability  
 we teach them to mask their true selves because they have to be  in nigerian speak hard man 
 in secondary school  a boy and a girl  both of them teenagers  both of them with the same amount of pocket money 
 would go out and then the boy would be expected always
  to pay to prove his masculinity and yet we wonder why boys are more likely to steal money from their parents 
 what if both boys and girls were raised not to link masculinity with money 
 what if the attitude was not the boy has to pay but rather whoever has more should pay 
 now of course because of that historical advantage
  it is mostly men who will have more today but if we start raising children differently  
 then in fifty years in a hundred years boys will no longer have the pressure of having to prove this masculinity 
 but by far the worst thing we do to males by making them feel that they have to be hard is that we leave them with very
  man feels compelled to be the weaker his ego is 
 and then we do a much greater disservice to girls because we raise them to cater to the fragile egos of men  
 we teach girls to shrink themselves to make themselves smaller we say to girls you can have ambition but not too much
  you should aim to be successful  but not too successful otherwise you would threaten the man 
 if you are the breadwinner in your relationship with a man  you have to pretend that you 're not especially in public  
 otherwise you will emasculate him  
 but what if we question the premise itself why should a woman 's success be a threat to a man  what if we decide
 simply dispose of that word and i don 't think there 's an english word i dislike more than emasculation 
 a nigerian acquaintance once asked me if i was worried that men would be intimidated by me  
 i was not worried at all in fact it had not occurred to me to be worried because
 a man who would be intimidated by me is exactly the kind of man i would have no interest in
  i was really struck by this 
 because i 'm female i 'm expected to aspire to marriage  
 i 'm expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important  
 a marriage can be a good thing  it can be a source of joy and love and
  but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don 't teach boys the same 
 i know a woman who decided to sell her house because she didn 't want to intimidate a man who might marry her 
 i know an unmarried woman
 in nigeria who when she goes to conferences wears a wedding ring because according to her she wants the other participants in the conference to give her
  i know young women who are under so much pressure from family from friends even from work
 to get married  and they 're pushed to make terrible choices 
 a woman at a certain age who is unmarried our society teaches her to see it as a deep personal failure 
 and a man at a certain age who is unmarried  we just think he hasn 't come around to making his pick
  it 's easy for us to say oh but women can just say no to all of this but the reality is more difficult and more complex 
 we 're all social beings we internalize ideas from our socialization even the language we use in talking about marriage and relationships illustrates this 
  the language of marriage is often the language of ownership rather than the language of partnership  
  to mean something a woman shows a man but often not something a man shows a woman 
 both men and women in nigeria will say this is an expression i 'm very amused by i did it for peace in my marriage 
 now when men say it it is usually about something that they should not be doing anyway 
 laughter sometimes they say it to their friends it 's something to say to their friends in a kind of fondly exasperated way
  something that ultimately proves how masculine they are how needed how loved oh
 my wife said i can 't go to the club every night so for peace in my marriage i do it only on weekends 
 now when a woman says i did it for peace in my marriage she 's usually talking about giving up
 a job a dream
  we teach females that in relationships compromise is what women do 
 we raise girls to see each other as competitors not for jobs or for accomplishments which i think can be a good thing  but for attention of men  
 we teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are if we have sons we don 't mind knowing about our sons
  but of course when the time is right we expect those girls to bring back the perfect man to be their husbands  
 we police girls we praise girls for virginity  but we don 't praise boys for virginity and it 's always made me wonder how exactly this is supposed to
  the loss of virginity is usually a process that involves  
 recently a young woman was gang raped in a university in nigeria i
 think some of us know about that and the response of many young nigerians both male and female was something along the lines of this 
 yes rape is wrong  
  doing in a room with four boys 
 now if we can forget the horrible inhumanity of that response 
 these nigerians have been raised to think of women as inherently guilty 
 and they have been raised to
 expect so little of men that the idea of men as savage beings without any control is somehow acceptable  we teach girls shame
  we make them feel as though by being born female they 're already guilty of something 
 and so girls grow up to be women who cannot see they have desire they grow up to be women who silence themselves 
 they grow up to be women who cannot say what they truly think and they grow up and this is the worst thing we did to girls they grow up to be women who have turned pretense into an art form
 i know a woman who hates domestic work 
 she just hates it but she pretends that she likes it 
 because she 's been taught
 that to be good wife material she has to be to use that nigerian word very homely
  and then she got married  and after a while her husband 's family began to complain that she had changed 
 actually she had not changed she just got tired of pretending 
 the problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be
 rather than recognizing how we are now imagine how much happier we would be how much freer
 to be our true individual selves  if we didn 't have the weight of gender expectations
 boys and girls are undeniably different
 biologically but socialization exaggerates the differences
 and then it becomes a self fulfilling process  now take cooking for example 
 today women in general are more likely to do the housework than men  the cooking and cleaning  but why is that is it because women are born with a cooking gene
  or because over years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role  
 actually i was going to say that maybe women are born with a cooking gene  until i remember that the majority of the famous cooks in the world whom we give the fancy title of chefs are men  
 i used to look up to my grandmother who was a brilliant brilliant woman and wonder how she would have been if she had the same opportunities as men when she was growing up
 now today there are many more opportunities for women  than there were during my grandmother 's time
 because of changes in policy changes in law  all of which are very important but what matters even more is our attitude 
 our mindset what we believe and what we value about gender 
 what if
 in raising children we focus on ability instead of gender what if in raising
  children we focus on interest
 instead of gender  
 i know a family who have a son and a daughter both of whom are brilliant at school who are wonderful lovely children when the boy is hungry the parents say to the girl go and cook indomie noodles for your brother now 
 the daughter doesn 't particularly like to cook indomie noodles but she 's
  and so she has to now what if the parents from the beginning taught both
 the boy and the girl to cook indomie cooking by the way is a very useful skill for boys to have i 've never
 never thought it made sense to leave such a crucial thing the ability to nourish oneself
 has the same degree and the same job as her husband when they get back from work  she does most of the housework  which i think is true for many marriages  but what struck me about them
 was that whenever her husband changed the baby 's diaper she said thank you to him  now what if
 she saw this as perfectly normal and natural that he should in fact  care for his child
 i 'm
 trying to unlearn many of the lessons of gender that i internalized when i was growing up  but i sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations 
 the first time i taught a writing class in graduate school  
 i was worried i wasn 't worried about
 the material i would teach because
  and i was going to teach what i enjoy teaching instead i was worried about what to wear 
 i wanted to be taken seriously  
 i knew that because i was female i will automatically have to prove my worth  
 and i was worried that if i looked too feminine i would not be taken seriously  i really wanted to wear my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt  
 but i decided not to 
  i wore a very serious very manly and very ugly suit 
 because the sad truth is that when it comes to appearance we start off with men as the standard as the norm  
 if a man is getting ready for a business meeting he doesn 't worry about looking too masculine and therefore not being taken for granted  
 if a woman has to get ready for business meeting she has to worry
 about looking too feminine and what it says and whether or not she will be taken
 i wish i had not worn that ugly suit that day
 i 've actually banished it from my closet by the way had i then the confidence that i have now
 to be myself my students would have benefited even more from my teaching  because i would have been more comfortable and more fully and more truly myself  
 i have chosen
 to no longer be apologetic for my
  for my femininity 
 and i want to be respected in all of my femaleness because i deserve to be 
 gender is not an easy conversation to have 
 for both men and women to bring up gender is sometimes to encounter almost immediate resistance i can imagine some people here are actually thinking
 women too do sef 
 some of the men here might be thinking ok all of this is interesting but i don 't think like that 
 and that is part of the problem that many men do not actively think about gender or notice gender
 is part of the problem of gender that
  like my friend louis that everything is fine now 
 and that many men do nothing to change it  if you are a man and you walk into a restaurant with a woman and the waiter greets only you 
 does it occur to you to ask the waiter why haven 't you greeted her
  we may repose part of a longer
 version of this talk so
 because gender can be a very uncomfortable conversation to have there are very easy ways to close it to close the conversation so some people will bring up evolutionary biology and apes how you know female apes bow down to
  apes also live on trees and
 have earthworms for breakfast  and we don 't  some people will say well poor men
 also have a hard time and this is true  
  but this is not what this conversation is about 
 gender and class
 are different forms of oppression i actually learned quite a bit about systems of oppression and how they can be blind to one another by talking to black men 
 i was once talking to
 a black man about gender and he said to me why do you have to
  experience as a woman ' why can 't it be ' your experience as a human being ' 
 now this was the same man who would often talk about his experience as a black man  
 gender matters men and women experience the world differently  
 gender colors the way we experience the world  but we can change that 
 some people will say oh but women have the real power  bottom power
 non nigerians bottom power is an expression which i suppose means something like a woman who uses her sexuality to get favors from men 
 but bottom power is not power at all 
 bottom power means that a woman simply has a good root to tap into from time to time somebody else 's
  and then of course we have to wonder what happens when that somebody else is in a bad mood or sick or impotent 
 some people will say that a woman being subordinate to a man is our culture  
 but culture is constantly changing i have beautiful twin nieces who are fifteen and live
  if they had been born a hundred years ago
 they would have been taken away and killed because it was our culture  it was our culture to kill twins so what is the point of culture
 i mean there 's the decorative the dancing but also culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people 
 in my family i am the child who is most interested in the story of who we are in our traditions in the knowledge about ancestral lands my brothers are
  as interested as i am but i cannot participate  i cannot go to umunna meetings i cannot have a say because i 'm female 
 culture does not make people people make culture 
 so if it is in fact true 
 so if it is in fact true that the full humanity of women is not our culture
  we must make it our culture  i think very often of my dear friend okoloma maduewesi may he
 and all the others who passed away in that sosoliso crash continue to rest in peace 
 he will always be remembered by those of us who loved him 
 and he was right that day many years ago when he called me a feminist i am
  feminist 
 and when i looked up the word in the dictionary that day this is what it said feminist  a person who believes in the social political and economic
 equality of the sexes 
 my great grandmother from the stories i 've heard was a feminist  
 she ran away from the house of the man she did not want to marry and ended up marrying the man of her choice  she refused she protested
  spoke up whenever she felt she was being deprived of access of land that sort of thing my great grandmother did not know that word feminist 
 but it doesn 't mean that she wasn 't one 
 more of us should reclaim that word 
 my own definition of feminist is a feminist is a man or a woman who says
 a feminist is a man or a woman who says 
 yes there 's a problem with gender
 as it is today and we must fix it we must do better 
 best feminist i know is my
