  let me introduce you to something i 've been working on 
 it 's what the victorian illusionists would have described as a mechanical marvel an automaton a
  these mechanical performers were popular throughout europe audiences marveled at the way they moved it
 was science fiction made true robotic engineering in a pre electronic age machines
 far in advance of anything that victorian technology could create a machine
  we would later know as the robot
 mechanical engineering and 
  of the conjurer 's art edi is different edi is real
  will you be my friend mt we are intrigued by the possibility of creating a mechanical version of ourselves  
 we build them so they look like us  
 behave like us and think like us the perfect robot will be indistinguishable from the human 
 and that scares us  in
  as i was saying  besides the faces and bodies we give our robots we cannot read their intentions and that makes
  when someone hands an object to you you can read intention in their eyes their face their body language 
 that 's not true of the robot  now this goes both ways 
 edi wow mt robots cannot anticipate human actions edi you know humans are so unpredictable 
 not to mention irrational i literally have no idea what you guys are going to do next
  robots find it difficult to work in close proximity  accidents are inevitable edi ow 
 that hurt mt sorry now one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust 
 much as the victorians faked their mechanical marvels  we can add a layer of deception
 to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends with that in
  mind  i set about teaching edi a magic trick
  pioneer of artificial intelligence spoke about creating the illusion that a machine
 could think edi a computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it deceived a human into believing
  in other words if we do not yet have the technological solutions would illusions serve the same purpose 
 to create the robotic illusion  we 've devised a set of ethical rules a code that all robots would live by 
 edi a robot
 may not harm humanity or by inaction
 allow humanity to come to harm 
  our machines we give them
 a friendly face and a reassuring voice edi 
 i am edi  i became operational at ted in march two thousand and fourteen mt we let them entertain us  most important  we make them indicate that they are aware of our presence edi 
 marco you 're standing on my foot mt sorry they
 'll be conscious of our fragile
 frame and move aside if we got too close and they 'll account for our unpredictability
 and anticipate our actions  and now  under the spell of a technological illusion  
 we could ignore our fears
 and truly
 interact
  that 's it thank you very much and thank you
