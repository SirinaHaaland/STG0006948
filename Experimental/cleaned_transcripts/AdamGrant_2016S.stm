  i want you to look around the room for a minute
 and try to find the most paranoid person here and then i want you to point at that person for me ok don
 't actually do it 
  as an organizational psychologist i spend a lot of time in workplaces  and i find paranoia everywhere 
 paranoia is caused by people that i call takers takers are self serving in their interactions it 's all about what can you do for me 
 the opposite is a giver  it 's somebody who approaches most interactions by asking what can i do for you 
 i wanted to give you a chance to think about your own style we all have moments of giving and taking your style
  this is the only thing i will say today that has no data behind it  but i am convinced the longer it takes for you to laugh at this cartoon the more worried we should be that you 're a taker
  of course not all takers are narcissists some are just givers who got burned one too many times  then there 's another kind of taker that we won 't be addressing today and that 's called a psychopath 
 i was curious though about how common these extremes are and so i surveyed over thirty thousand people across industries around the world 's cultures  and i found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking  they choose this third style called
  matching 
 if you 're a matcher you try to keep an even balance of give and take quid pro quo i 'll do something for you if you do something for me  
 and that seems like a safe way to live your life but is it the most effective and productive way to live your life 
 the answer to that question is a very definitive  maybe 
 i studied dozens of organizations thousands of people i had engineers measuring their productivity
 i looked at medical students ' grades even salespeople 's revenue 
 and unexpectedly the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers 
 the engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors than they got back  they were so busy doing other people 's jobs they literally ran out of time and energy to get their own work completed 
  school the lowest grades belong to the students who agree most strongly with statements like i love helping others 
 which suggests the doctor you ought to trust is the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody 
 and then in sales too the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople 
 i actually reached out to one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score  and i asked him why do you suck at
  your job i didn 't ask it that way but what 's the cost of generosity in sales and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that
 i would never sell them one of our crappy products 
 laughter so just out of curiosity how many of you self identify more as givers than takers or matchers raise your hands ok 
 it would have been more before we talked about these data 
 but
 actually it turns out
  's a twist here  because givers are often sacrificing themselves  but they make their organizations better we have a huge body of evidence
 many many studies looking at the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team or an organization and the more often people are helping and sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring  
 the better organizations do on every metric we can measure  higher profits customer satisfaction
  retention even lower operating expenses  so givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people and improve the team  and then unfortunately they suffer along the way 
 i want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers actually get to succeed  
 so i wondered then if givers are the worst performers who are the best performers
  let me start with the good news  it 's not the takers takers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs  
 and they fall at the hands of matchers 
 if you 're a matcher you believe in an eye for an eye a just world  
 and so when you meet a taker you feel like it 's your mission in life to just punish the hell out of that person 
 and that way justice gets served well most people are matchers and that means if you 're a
  it tends to catch up with you eventually what goes around will come around  and so the logical conclusion is it must be the matchers who are the best performers  
 but they 're not in every job in every organization i 've ever studied the best results belong to the givers again
 take a look at some data i gathered from hundreds of salespeople tracking their revenue  
 what you can see is that the givers go to both extremes  they make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue but also the highest revenue  the same patterns were true for engineers ' productivity and
  students ' grades givers are overrepresented at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that i can track  
 which raises the question how do we create a world where more of these givers get to excel i want to talk about how to do that not just in businesses but also in nonprofits schools
 even governments are you ready i was going to do it anyway but i appreciate the enthusiasm
  's really critical is to recognize that givers are your most valuable people but if they 're not careful  they burn out so
 you have to protect the givers in your midst  and i learned a great lesson about this from fortune 's best networker  
 it 's the guy not the cat 
 laughter his name is adam rifkin  he 's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount of his time helping other people and his secret weapon
  is the five minute favor  
 adam said you don 't have to be mother teresa or gandhi to be a giver  you just have to find small ways to add large value to other people 's lives 
 that could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other 
 it could be sharing your knowledge or giving a little bit of feedback or it might be even something as basic
  you know i 'm going to try and figure out if i can recognize somebody whose work has gone unnoticed 
 and those five minute favors are really critical to helping givers set boundaries and protect themselves
 the second thing that matters if you want to build a culture where givers succeed is you actually need a culture where help seeking is the norm  where people ask a lot 
 this may hit a little too close to home for some of you
  is they recognize that it 's ok to be a receiver too
 if you run an organization we can actually make this easier we can make it easier for people to ask for help a
 couple colleagues and i studied hospitals we found that on certain floors  nurses did a lot of help seeking and on other floors they did very little of it
 the factor that stood out on the floors where help seeking was common where it was the norm
  was there was just one nurse whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit
 when that role was available nurses said it 's not embarrassing it 's not vulnerable to ask for help it 's actually encouraged 
  important just for protecting the success and the  well being of givers it 's also critical to getting more people to act like givers 
 because the data say that somewhere between seventy five and ninety percent of all giving in organizations
 starts with a request 
 but a lot of people don 't ask they don 't want to look incompetent they don 't know where to turn they don 't want to burden others
 yet if nobody ever asks for help you have a lot of frustrated givers in your organization who would love to step up and contribute if they only knew who could benefit and how  
 but i think the most important thing if you want to build a culture of successful givers is to be thoughtful about who you let onto your team  i figured
  you want a culture of productive generosity you should hire a bunch of givers  but i was surprised to discover actually that that was not right
 that the negative impact of a taker on a culture is usually double to triple the positive impact of a giver 
 think about it this way one bad apple can spoil a barrel  but one good egg just does not make a dozen i don 't
 know what that means 
 laughter but i hope you do no
 let even one taker into a team  and you will see that the givers
  will stop helping they 'll say i 'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks why should i contribute 
 whereas if you let one giver into a team you don 't get an explosion of of generosity more often people are like great that person can do all our work 
 so effective hiring and screening and team building is not about bringing in the givers  it 's about weeding out the takers 
 if you can do that well you 'll be left with givers and
  givers will be generous because they don 't have to worry about the consequences and the beauty of the matchers is that they follow the norm  
 so how do you catch a taker before it 's too late we
 're actually pretty bad at figuring out who 's a taker especially on first impressions there 's a personality trait that throws us off it 's called agreeableness one the major dimensions of personality across cultures agreeable people are warm and friendly they 're nice they 're polite
  you find a lot of them in canada 
 where
 there was actually a national contest to come up with a new canadian slogan and fill in the blank as canadian as i
 thought the winning entry was going to be as canadian as maple syrup or ice hockey but no canadians voted for their new national slogan to be i kid you not as
  now for those of you who are highly agreeable or maybe slightly canadian  you
 get this right away how could i ever say i 'm any one thing when i 'm constantly adapting to try to please other people 
 disagreeable people do less of it they 're more critical skeptical challenging and far more likely than their peers to go to law school 
 that 's not a joke that 's actually an empirical fact
  assumed that agreeable people were givers and disagreeable people were takers  but then i gathered the data and i was stunned to find no correlation between those traits
 because it turns out that 
  is your outer veneer  how pleasant is it to interact with you whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values  what are your intentions toward others
 if you really want to judge people accurately  you have to get to the moment every consultant in the room is waiting
  for and draw a two by two 
 the agreeable givers are easy to spot they say yes to everything
 the disagreeable takers are also recognized quickly although you might call them by a slightly different
  we forget about the other two combinations there are disagreeable givers in our organizations there
 are people who are gruff and tough on the surface but underneath have others ' best interests at heart 
 or as an engineer put it oh disagreeable givers like somebody with a bad user interface but a great operating system
  the ones who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear we need to do a much better job valuing these people as opposed to writing them off early and saying 
 eh kind of prickly  must be a selfish taker 
 the other combination we forget about is the deadly one the agreeable taker also known as the faker 
 this is the person who 's nice to your face and then will stab you right in the back
 and my favorite way to catch these people in the interview process is to ask the question can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have fundamentally improved 
 the takers will give you four names  and they will all be more influential than them  because takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down 
 givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy who don 't have as much power
  can do them no good and let 's face it you all know you can learn a lot about character by watching how someone treats their restaurant server or their uber driver  
 so if we do all this well if we can weed takers out of organizations if we can make it safe to ask for help if we can protect givers from burnout
 and make it ok for them to be ambitious in pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people we can actually change the way that people define success
  instead of saying it 's all about winning a competition people will realize success is really more about contribution 
 i believe that the most meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed  
 and if we can spread that belief we can actually turn paranoia upside down  there 's a name for that it 's called 
  is the delusional belief that other people are plotting your
 that they 're going around behind your back and saying exceptionally glowing things about you 
 the great thing about a culture of givers is that 's not a delusion it 's reality
 i want to live in a world where givers succeed  and i hope you will help me create that world
