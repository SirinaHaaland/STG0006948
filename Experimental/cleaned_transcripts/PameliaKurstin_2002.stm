 the
  whoa
  thing that happens is people scream
  i 'm sure you 're trying to figure out well how does this thing work well what i 'm doing is controlling
 the pitch with my
  so the further away my right hand gets the louder it gets 
 tones so basically with both of your hands you 're controlling
  pitch and volume and
 kind of trying to create the illusion that you 're doing separate notes when really it 's continuously going 
 sometimes i startle myself i 'll
  's like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don 't turn the thing off laughter
 maybe we 'll go into the next tune because i totally lost where this is going we
 're going to do a song by david mash called listen the words are gone
  maybe i 'll have words come back into me afterwards if i can
  and
 the
  oh
  came up with the idea for
 making the theremin  i think when he was working on some shortwave radios and there 'd be that sound in the signal it 's like 
 and he thought oh what if i could control
  that sound and turn it into an instrument because there are pitches in it and so somehow
 through developing that he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now  and
 a lot of times  even kids nowadays they 'll make reference
  's kind of a funny goofy sound to do and sometimes if i have too much coffee then my vibrato gets out of hand you 're
 really sensitive to your body and its
  you 're behind this thing you have to stay so still if you want to have the most control it reminds me of the balancing act earlier on what michael was doing because you 're fighting so hard
 to keep the balance with
 what you 're playing with and stay in tune and at the same time you don 't want to focus so much on
 being in tune all the time you want to be feeling the music
  and then also you 're trying to
 stay very very very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch or sometimes if you 're holding a low note
  so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing  or just
 aware of what you don 't want it to be doing while you 're playing you don 't want to have any sudden movements and
 if i go to a club and play a gig people are like here have some drinks on us and it 's like well i 'm about to go on soon i don 't want to be like
  you know it really does reflect the mood that you 're in also if you 're 
 it 's similar to being a vocalist except instead of it coming out of your throat you 're controlling it just in the air and
 you don 't really have a point of reference you 're always relying on your ears and
 adjusting
  you just have to always adjust to what 's happening and realize you 'll have bummer notes come here and there and
 listen to it adjust it and just move on or else you 'll get too tied up and
  favorite tunes to play
  oh
  ooh
  oh
