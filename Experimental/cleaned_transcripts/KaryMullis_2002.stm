  talking about the seventeenth century i hope nobody
 finds that offensive
 i you know when i when i after i had invented pcr i kind of needed a change and i moved down to la jolla and learned how to surf and i started living down there on the beach for a long
  time
 and
 when surfers are out waiting for waves you probably wonder if you 've never been out there what are they doing you know sometimes there 's a ten fifteen minute break out there when you 're waiting for a wave to come in
 they usually talk about the seventeenth century
 you know they get a real bad rap in the world people think they 're sort of lowbrows
 one day somebody suggested i read this book it was called
  it was called the air pump or something like the leviathan and the air pump it was a real weird book about the seventeenth century and i realized
 the roots of the way i sort of thought was just the only natural way to think about things
 that you know i was born thinking about things that way and i had always been like a little scientist guy and when i went to find out something i used scientific methods i wasn 't real surprised
 you know when they first told me how how
  how you were supposed to do science because i 'd already been doing it for fun and whatever
 but it didn 't it never occurred to me that it had to be invented and that it had been invented only three hundred and fifty years ago
 you know it was it was like it happened in england and germany and italy sort of all at the same
  and the story of that i thought was really fascinating so i 'm going to talk a little bit about that and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do and
 it 's it 's a kind of you know charles i got beheaded somewhere early in the seventeenth century and the english set up
 cromwell and a whole bunch of republicans or whatever and not the kind of republicans we had
  the son
 was finally put back on the throne of england
 he was really nervous because his dad had been you know beheaded for being the king of england
 and he was nervous about the fact that conversations that got going in like bars
  kind of it 's hard to believe but people in the seventeenth century in england
 were starting to talk about you know philosophy and stuff in bars they didn 't have tv screens and they didn 't have any football games to watch and they would get really
 pissy and all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight about issues like whether or not
 it was okay if robert boyle made a device called the vacuum pump now boyle was a friend of charles ii he was a christian
  guy during the weekends but during the week he was a scientist
 which was back then it was sort of you know well you know if you
 if you made this thing he made this little device like kind of like a bicycle pump in reverse that could suck all the air out of you know what
  pick it up put it down and it 's got a seal and you can see inside of it so you can see what 's going on inside this thing but what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there and see what would happen inside there
 i mean the first i think one of the first experiments he did was he put a bird in there
 and and people in the seventeenth century they didn 't really understand the same way we do about you know this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules and we breathe it
  in for a purpose and all that i mean fish don 't know much about water and people didn 't know much about air
 but both started
 exploring it one thing he put a bird in there and he pumped all the air out and the bird died so
 he said hmm he said he called what he 'd done as making they didn 't call it a vacuum pump at the time now you call it a vacuum pump
 he called it a vacuum right and
  got into trouble with the local clergy who said you can 't make a vacuum ah uh
 aristotle said that nature abhors one i think it was a poor translation probably but
 people relied on authorities like that and you know boyle says well shit
 i make them all the time i mean whatever that is that kills the bird and i 'm calling it a vacuum and
 the religious people said that
 if
 god wanted you to make i mean
 god is everywhere that was one of their rules is god is everywhere
 and a vacuum there 's nothing in a vacuum so you 've god couldn 't be in there so therefore the church said that you can 't make a vacuum you know and boyle said bullshit i mean
 you want to call it godless you know you call it
  godless but that 's not my job i 'm not into that i do that on the weekend and like
 what i 'm trying to do is figure out what happens when you suck everything out of a compartment and he did all these cute little experiments like he did one with
 he had a little wheel like a fan that was that was
 sort of loosely attached so it could spin by itself he had another fan opposed to it
  had like a i mean the way i would have done this would be like a rubber band and you know around a tinker toy kind of fan i know exactly how he did it i 've seen the drawings it 's two fans one which he could turn from outside after he got the vacuum established
 and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it the one fan would no longer turn the other one right
 something was missing you know i mean these are it 's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment
  that but that was what was going on at the time and and like there was big arguments about it in the you know the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff
 and charles started not liking that charles ii was kind of saying you know you should keep that
 let 's let 's make a place where you can do this stuff where people don 't get so you know we don 't want the we don 't want to get the people mad at me again
 and so
 because when they started talking about religion and science and stuff like that that 's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble and so
 charles said i 'm going to put up the money give you guys a building
 come here and you can meet in the building but just don 't talk about religion in there and that was fine with boyle he said ok we 're going to start having these meetings and anybody who wants to do science
  the time that isaac newton was starting to whip out a lot of really interesting things and there was all kind of people that would come to the royal society they called it
 you had to be dressed up pretty well it wasn 't like a ted conference the was the only criteria was that
 you be you be you looked like a gentleman and they 'd let anybody could come you didn 't have to be a member then
 and so they would come in and you would do anybody that was going to
 show an experiment which was kind of a new word
 demonstrate some principle they had to do it on stage where everybody could see it so they were the really important part of this was
 you were not supposed to talk about final causes for instance and god was out of the picture the actual nature of reality was not at issue
  not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything you were not supposed to talk about anything that you couldn 't demonstrate so if somebody could see it you could say here 's how the machine works
 here 's what we do and then here 's what happens and seeing what happens it was ok to generalize and say
 i 'm sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things and so you can you can start making up some rules you say anytime you have a vacuum state you will discover
  that one wheel will not turn another one if if the only connection between them is whatever was there before the vacuum that kind of thing
 candles can 't burn in a vacuum therefore probably sparklers wouldn 't either it 's not clear actually sparklers will but
 they didn 't know that they didn 't have sparklers but they
 you can make up rules but they have to relate
 only to the things that you 've been able to demonstrate and most the demonstrations had to do with visuals
 like if you do an experiment on stage and nobody can see it they can just hear it they would probably think you were freaky i mean
 reality is what you can see
 that wasn 't an explicit rule in in the meeting but i 'm sure that was part of it you know if people hear voices
 and they can 't see and associate it with somebody that person 's probably not there
 but
  the general idea that you could only
 you could only really talk about things in that place
 that had some kind of experimental basis it didn 't matter what thomas hobbes who was a local philosopher said about it
 you know because you weren 't going to talking final causes what 's happening here in the middle of the seventeenth century was that what became my field science experimental science
 pulling itself away and it was in a physical way because we 're going to do it in this room over here but it was also what it was an amazing thing that happened science had been all interlocked with theology
 and philosophy
 and and and mathematics which is really not science
 but experimental science has been tied up with all those things
  and the experimental science part was pulling away from philosophy and things we never looked back it 's been so cool since then
 i mean it just it just untangled a thing that was really impeding
 technology from being developed
 and i mean everybody in this room now this is three hundred and fifty short years ago remember that 's a short time it was three hundred thousand probably years ago that
  of us the ancestors of most of us in this room came up out of africa and turned to the left
 you know the ones that turned to the right there are some of those in the japanese translation but that that happened very a long time ago
 compared to three hundred and fifty short years ago but in that three hundred and fifty years the place has just undergone a lot of changes in fact everybody in this room probably especially if you picked
  up your bag some of you i know didn 't pick up your bags but if you picked up your bag everybody in this room has got in their pocket or back in their room something
 that three hundred and fifty years ago kings would have gone to war to have
 i mean if you can think how important if you have a gps system and there are no satellites it 's not going to be much use but like but
 you know if somebody had a gps system in the seventeenth
  century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it you know if that person for the teddy bear the teddy bear they might have done it for the teddy bear yeah
 but all of us own stuff i mean individuals own things that kings would have definitely gone to war to get and this is just
 three hundred and fifty years not a whole lot of people doing this stuff
  you know the important people you can almost read about their lives about all the really important people that made advances you know and i mean
 this kind of stuff you know all this stuff came from from that separation
 of this little sort of thing that we do now i when i was a boy
 was born sort of with this idea that if you want to know something you know maybe it 's because my old man was gone a lot and my mother didn 't really know much science but i thought if you want to know something about stuff you do it
 you make an experiment you know you get you get like
 i just had a natural feeling for science and setting up experiments i thought that was the way everybody had always thought i thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way it isn 't true i mean there 's a lot of people you know i was one of those scientists that
 was got into trouble the other night at dinner because of the post modernism thing and i didn 't mean you know where is that lady
  i mean i didn 't really think of that as an argument so much as just a lively discussion
 i didn 't take it personally but
 i just
 i had i naively had thought until this surfing experience started me into the seventeenth century
 i 'd thought that that 's just the way people thought and everybody did and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear
 at any rate
 when i was a
  boy
 i like for instance i i had this i got this little book from fort sill oklahoma this is about the time that george dyson 's dad was starting to blow nuclear thinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff
 i was thinking about making my own little rockets and i knew that frogs little frogs had aspirations of space travel just like people
 and i
  i i was looking for a
 a propulsion system
 that would like make a rocket like maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles
 and i mean that was my sort of goal i wanted it to go out of sight and then i wanted this little parachute to come back
 with the frog in it and
  i got this book from fort sill oklahoma where there 's a missile base they send it out for amateur rocketeers and
 it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar
 you know that 's what you call a lead
 you sort of now you say well let 's see if i
  some potassium chlorate and sugar perchlorate and sugar and heat it it would be interesting to see what it is they don 't want me to do and what it is going to and how is it going to work and
 we didn 't have like my mother
 presided
 over the back yard from an upstairs window where she would be ironing or something like that and she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on and if there was puffs of smoke out there she 'd lean out and
 admonish us all not to blow our eyes out that was her
  kind of the worst thing that could happen to us that 's why i thought as long as i don 't blow my eyes out
 i may not care about the fact that it 's prohibited from heating this solution i 'm going to do it carefully but i 'll
 do it it 's like anything else that 's prohibited you do it behind the garage
 so i i went to the drug store and i tried to buy some potassium perchlorate and it wasn 't unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a
  drug store and buy chemicals nowadays it 's no ma 'am check your shoes and like
 but then it wasn 't they didn 't have any but the guy had i said what kind of salts or potassium do you have you know and he had potassium nitrate and i said
 that might do the same thing whatever it is
 i 'm sure it 's got to do with rockets or it wouldn 't be in that manual and so i i did some experiments you know i started
  tiny amounts of potassium nitrate and sugar which was readily available and i mixed it in different proportions and i tried to light it on fire
 just to see what would happen if you mixed it together and it they burned it burned kind of slow but it made a nice smell compared to other rocket fuels i had tried that all had sulfur in them
 and it smelt
  and then i tried the melting business and i melted it
 and then it it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid brown and then it cooled down to a brick hard substance
 that when you lit that it went off like a bat
 i mean the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down you 'd light it and it would just start dancing around the yard and i said there is a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go
 so i started developing you know george 's dad
 had a lot of help i just had my brother but i it took me about
 it took me about i 'd say six months to finally figure out all the little things there 's a lot of little things involved in making a rocket that it will actually work even after you have the fuel
 but you do it by what i just you know you do experiments
 and you write down things sometimes you make observations you know and then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff
  works and it was i was following all the rules i didn 't know what the rules were i 'm a natural born scientist i guess or
 some kind of a throwback to the seventeenth century whatever but at any rate we finally did
 have a device that would reproduceably put a frog out of sight and get him back alive
  had not
 i mean we weren 't frightened by it we should have been because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise
 and it was powerful you know and once in a while they would blow up but
 i wasn 't worried by the way about you know
 the explosion causing the destruction of the planet i hadn 't heard about the ten ways that we should be afraid of the by the way
  i could have thought i 'd better not do this because
 they say not to you know and i 'd better get permissionfrom the government if i 'd have waited around for that i would have never the frog would have died
 you know
 at any rate i bring it up because it 's a good story and he said tell personal things you know and that 's a personal i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife but that would be too personal wouldn 't it
 so
 so i 've got something else that 's not personal but that process is what
  think of as science see where you start with some idea and then instead of like looking up
 every authority that you 've ever heard of i sometimes you do that if you 're going to write a paper later you want to figure out who else has worked on it but in the actual process you 
  get an idea like when i got the idea one night that i could amplify dna with two oligonucleotides and i could make lots of copies of some little piece of dna
 the thinking for that was about twenty minutes
 while i was driving my car and then instead of going i went back and i did talk to people about it but if i 'd listened to what i heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists
 i would have abandoned it you know if i had gone back looking for an authority figure who could tell me if it would work or not he would have said no
  probably won 't
 because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody 's goddamn way of doing molecular biology nobody want a chemist to come in and poke around in their stuff like that and change things
 but if if you go to authority and you always don 't you don 't
 always get the right answer see but i knew you 'd go into the lab and you 'd try to make it work yourself and then you 're the authority and you can say i know it works because right there in that tube is where it happened and here on this gel there 's a little band there that i know
  that 's dna and that 's the dna i wanted to amplify so there so it does work
 you know that 's how you do science and then you say well what can make it work better and then you figure out better and better ways to do it but you always work from from like facts that you have made 
 available to you by doing experiments things that you could do on a stage and no tricky shit behind the thing i mean it 's all you 've got to be very honest
 i mean you can 't make up results and then do another experiment based on that one so you have to be honest
 and i 'm basically honest i have a fairly bad memory and dishonesty would always get me in trouble
 if i like so i 've just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive and that sort of leads to that kind of science now let 's see
  a lot
 there is a lot a lot has been going on since since isaac newton and all that stuff happened
 one of the things that happened right around world war ii in that same time period before and as sure as hell afterwards
 government got realized that scientists aren 't strange dudes that you know hide in in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with
 scientists you know made world war ii as we know it quite possible they made faster things they made
 bigger guns to shoot them down with you know they made
 drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process they made all kinds of and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole
  everybody stepped back a little and said you know we ought to invest in this shit
 because whoever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a dominant position at least in the military and probably in all kind of economic ways and 
  they got involved in it and the scientific and industrial establishment was born and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money
  that later went in to medical school you know because there was money in it you know i mean later then they all got into business i mean there are waves of going into
 your high school person saying you want to be right you know be a scientist you know not anymore you want to be rich you be a businessman but a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel that 's
 back when travel was easy
 and
  those people don 't think they don 't they
 they don 't always tell you the truth you know there is nothing in their contract in fact that makes it to their advantage always to tell you the truth
 and the people i 'm talking about are people that like
 they say that they 're a member of the committee called say the inter governmental panel on climate change
 and they and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out
 how we 're going to how we 're going to continually prove that the planet is
  warmer
 when that 's actually contrary to most people 's sensations i mean if you actually measure the temperature
 over a period i mean the temperature has been measured now pretty carefully for about fifty sixty years
 longer than that it 's been measured but in really nice
 precise ways and records have been kept for fifty or sixty years and in fact the temperature hadn 't really gone up it 's like the average temperature has
  gone up a tiny little bit because the nighttime temperatures at the weather stations have come up just a little bit but there 's a good explanation for that and it 's that the weather stations 
  are all built outside of town where the airport was and now the town 's moved out there there 's concrete all around and they call it the skyline effect and most responsible people that measure 
  temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that and even then
 you know because the buildings get warm in the daytime and they keep it a little warmer at night so the temperature has been sort of inching up it should have been but not a lot not like you know
 the first guy the first guy that got the idea that we 're going to fry ourselves here actually he didn 't think of it that way his name was sven arrhenius he was he was swedish
 and he said if you double the cotwo level in the atmosphere which he thought might this is
  temperature ought to go up about five five degrees he calculated he was thinking of the earth as kind of like you know like a
 completely insulated thing with no stuff in it really just energy coming down energy leaving
 and so he came up with this theory and he said this will be cool because it 'll be a longer growing season in sweden
 you know and the surfers liked it the surfers thought that 's a cool idea because it 's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes
 and but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad you know but
  has gone up a tiny little bit
