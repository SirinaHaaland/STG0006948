  i started a fashion blog called style rookie  last september of two thousand and eleven  i started an online magazine for teenage girls called rookiemag com 
 my name 's tavi gevinson and
  the title of my talk is still figuring it out and the ms paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today 's theme and has nothing to do with my inability to use powerpoint 
 so
 i edit this site for teenage girls i 'm a feminist i am kind of a pop culture nerd and i think a lot about what makes a strong female character
  shows these things have influence my own website
 so i think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted  and instead we get these two dimensional superwomen
 who maybe have one quality that 's played up a lot like
 a catwoman type or
  plays her sexuality up a lot and it 's seen as power but they 're not strong characters who happen to be female 
 they 're completely flat and they 're basically cardboard characters the problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand 
 and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple when in actuality women are complicated women are multifaceted not because women are crazy  but because people are crazy and women
  to be people 
 so the flaws are the key i 'm not the first person to say this what makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses who has flaws 
 who is maybe not immediately likable but eventually relatable 
 i don 't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it so just wanted to acknowledge
  shows like mad men movies like bridesmaids whose female characters or protagonists are
 complex multifaceted
  lena dunham who 's on here 
 her show on hbo that premiers next month girls 
 she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions and that feels accurate for all people but you don 't see women represented like that as much
  guys 
 but i don 't feel that
 i still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way and one group that we 'll focus on today are teens because i think teenagers are especially contradictory and
 still figuring it out
  lindsay weir and angela chase  i mean the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out basically  
 but those shows only lasted a season each  and i haven 't really seen anything like that on tv since
  so this is a scientific diagram
  the time when i was when i started watching those tv shows i was ending middle school starting high school i 'm a sophomore now
 and
 i was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you 're told you can 't be when you 're growing up as a girl you can 't be smart and pretty you can 't be a feminist who 's also interested in fashion you can 't
 care about clothes if it 's not for the sake of what other people usually men will think of you
 so i was trying to figure all that out  and i felt a little confused  and i said so on my blog and
 i said that i wanted to start
 a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one dimensional strong character empowerment thing
 because i think one thing that can be very alienating about a
  misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist  they have to live up to
 being perfectly consistent in your beliefs never being insecure never having doubts having all of the answers  and this is not true and actually  
 reconciling all the contradictions i was feeling became easier once i understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion a conversation
 a process  and this is a spread from a zine that i made last year when
 i i mean i think i 've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since but yeah 
 so i said on my blog that i wanted to start
 this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing their photography whatever to be a member of our staff i
  got about three thousand emails my editorial director and i went through them and
 put together a staff of people and we launched last september  
 and this is an excerpt from my first editor 's letter where i say that rookie  we don 't have all the answers we 're still figuring it out too  but the point is not to give
  and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission they can ask their own questions find their own answers 
 all of that and rookie  i think we 've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out
 in a way that shows those different dimensions  i mean we have articles called 
 on taking yourself seriously how to not care what people think of you but we also have articles like oops
 i 'm figuring it out ha ha 
 laughter if you use that you can get away with
  we also have articles called how to look like you weren 't just crying in less than five minutes so all of that being said i still really appreciate those characters
 in movies and
 articles like that on our site that aren 't just about being totally powerful maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and
  how you accept those
