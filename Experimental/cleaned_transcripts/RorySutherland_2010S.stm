  may remember me from tedglobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me one of them was why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the eurostar train when for about ten percent
  you could have top supermodels male and female serving free chateau petrus to all the passengers for the entire duration of the journey  you 'd still have five billion left in change and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down now
 you may remember me asking the question as well a very interesting observation that actually those strange little signs that actually flash thirty five at you occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown  according to whether you 're within or outside the speed limit
 those are actually more effective
  at preventing road accidents than speed cameras which come with the actual threat of real punishment  
 so there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work  i think in many areas of human problem solving particularly those which involve human psychology  
 which is the tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible as much compulsion as possible
  actually the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in
 absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied  
 so there seems to be a complete disconnect here  so what i 'm asking for is the creation of a new job title i 'll come to this a little later and perhaps the addition of a new word
 into the english language
  because it does seem to me that large organizations including government which is of course the largest organization of all have actually become completely disconnected
 with what actually matters to people 
 let me give you one example of this you may remember this as the aol time warner merger okay  
 heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time it may still be for all i know  
 now all of you in this room in one form or other are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged
  just interested did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all  
 so unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no doubt lucrative activity you 're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger all to anybody okay 
 by contrast  years of marketing have taught me that if you actually want people to remember you and to appreciate what you
  do the most potent things are actually very very small this is from virgin atlantic upper class it 's the cruet salt and pepper set 
 quite nice in itself they 're little sort of airplane things what 's really really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought  which is i reckon i can heist these 
 however you pick them
  years after you remember the strategic question of whether you 're flying in a seven hundred and seventy seven or an airbus you remember those words and that experience 
 similarly this is from a hotel in stockholm the lydmar has anybody stayed there it
 's the lift it 's a series of buttons in the lift nothing unusual about that at all
  except that these are actually
  not the buttons that take you to an individual floor it starts with garage at the bottom i suppose appropriately  but it doesn 't go up garage grand floor mezzanine one two three four it actually says garage  funk  rhythm and blues 
 you have a series of buttons you actually choose your lift music
  my guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the lydmar hotel in stockholm is probably five hundred to one thousand pounds max it
  frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we 've all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of five hundred thousand dollars in order to make 
  it resemble every other hotel room you 've ever stayed in in in the entire course of your life 
  of poverty in the developing world actually spoke  
 and she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which in a business context or a government context would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing 
 it was simply to encourage the inoculation of children
 by not only making it a social event i think good use of behavioral economics in that if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated
 your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone  but secondly to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated  
 it 's a tiny tiny thing  
 if you 're a senior person at unesco and someone says so what are you doing to eradicate world poverty 
 you 're not really confident standing up there saying i 've got it cracked  it 's the lentils
  our own sense of  self aggrandizement feels that big important problems need to have big important  and most of all expensive solutions attached to them 
 and yet what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there 's a very very strong disproportionality at work 
 that actually what changes
  our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed or the degree of force that 's applied  
 but everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality  so what happens in an institution
 is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very very large budget  and once you have a very very large budget
  you actually look for expensive things to spend it on what is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power  but no money at all laughter
 it 's those people i 'd quite like to create in the world going forward now  
 here 's another thing that happens  which is what i call sometimes terminal five syndrome which is that big expensive things get big highly intelligent attention  and they 're great and terminal five is
  absolutely magnificent until you get down to the small detail the usability  which is the signage  
 which is catastrophic  you come out of arrive at the airport and you follow a big yellow sign that says trains and it 's in front of you so you walk for another hundred yards
  expecting perhaps another sign that might courteously be yellow in front of you and saying trains no no no the next one is actually blue to your left and says heathrow express i mean
 it could almost be rather like that scene from the film airplane a yellow sign that 's exactly what they 'll be expecting
 what happens in the world increasingly now  all credit to the british airport authority i spoke about this before and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said okay what can you do so i did come up with 
 five suggestions which they are actually actioning one of them also being although logically it 's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it if it only serves two floors
  actually bloody terrifying okay  because when the door closes and there 's nothing for you to do you 've actually just stepped into a hammer film 
 so these questions what is happening in the world is the big stuff actually is done magnificently well  
 but the small stuff what you might call the user interface 
 is done spectacularly badly but also there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions because the people who can actually solve them
  actually are too powerful and too preoccupied with something they think of as strategy to actually solve them i tried this exercise recently talking about banking they said can we do an advertising campaign what can we 
  do and encourage more online banking i said it 's really really easy i said when people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they 'd probably quite like to look at the last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance i 've got friends who actually
  never use their own bank cash machines because there 's the risk that it might display their balance on the screen  why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news 
 okay you simply wouldn 't i said if you make actually ' tell me my balance ' if you make that an option rather than the default you 'll find twice as many people log on to online banking  and they do it three times as often 
 let 's face it most of us how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash
  from a cash machine and you 're pretty rich by the standards of the
 the world at large now interesting that no single person does that or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it  
 but what 's interesting about that suggestion was that to implement that suggestion wouldn 't cost ten million pounds it wouldn 't involve large amounts of expenditure  it would actually cost about fifty quid  
 and yet it never happens  because there 's a fundamental disconnect as i said
  actually the people with the power want to do big expensive things and there
 's to some extent a big strategy myth that 's prevalent in business now and if you think about it  it 's very very important that the strategy myth is maintained because if the board of directors convince 
  everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of
  it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company 's success might actually lie somewhere else in small pieces of tactical activity  
 but
 what is happening is that effectively and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn 't helped this lots of things haven 't helped this business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy  it wants 
  the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate  it 's a kind of mechanistic world
  that we 'd all love to live in where  
 effectively it sits very nicely on spreadsheets everything is numerically expressible and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success 
 that 's the world people actually want in truth we do live in a world that science can understand unfortunately the science is probably closer to being climatology
 in that in many cases very very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects
  and equally  vast areas of activity enormous mergers can actually accomplish absolutely bugger all 
 but it 's very very uncomfortable for us to to actually acknowledge that we 're living in such a world but what i 'm saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves
 if we looked at it in this very simple four way approach that
  not denying that strategy has a role you know there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot and i 'd be wrong to wrong to dis that completely 
 moving over we come of course to consultancy 
 i thought
  it was very indecent of accenture to ditch tiger woods in such a sort of hurried and hasty way  
 i mean tiger surely was actually obeying the accenture model he developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services
  tied to a single monopoly provider in many cases sourcing things locally and of course
 the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load balancing so
 what accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that i 'm not sure  then there are other things that don 't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing that 's called trivia  
 but there 's a fourth thing  and the fundamental problem is we don 't actually have a word for this stuff
 we don 't know what to call it 
 and actually we don 't spend nearly enough money looking for those things looking for those tiny things that may or may not work  
 but which if they do work  can have a success absolutely out of proportion to their expense 
 their efforts and the disruption they cause 
 so the first thing i 'd like is a competition to anybody watching this as a film is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom
  right  
 and the second thing i think is that the world needs to have people in charge of that that 's why i call for the chief detail officer every corporation should have one and every government should have a ministry of detail 
 the people who actually have no money who have no extravagant budget  but who realize that actually
 you might achieve
 greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay  but you 'll probably achieve
  exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible english  
 and if actually we created a ministry of detail and business actually had chief detail officers  then that fourth quadrant  which is so woefully neglected at the moment might finally get the attention it deserves
