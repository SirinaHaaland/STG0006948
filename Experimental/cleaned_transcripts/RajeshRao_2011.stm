  i 'd like to begin with a thought experiment 
 imagine that it 's four thousand years into the future civilization as we know it has ceased to exist
 no books no electronic devices no facebook or twitter
 all knowledge of the english language
 and the english alphabet has been lost  
 now imagine archeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities  what might they find well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic
 with strange symbols on them perhaps some circular pieces of metal maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them
 and perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers buried in the hills somewhere in north america
 massive versions of these same symbols 
 now let 's ask ourselves what could such artifacts
 say about us to people four thousand years into the future this is no hypothetical question in fact this is exactly the kind of question we 're faced with
  when we try to understand the indus valley civilization which existed four thousand years ago 
 the indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known egyptian and the mesopotamian civilizations but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations  it occupied the area of approximately one million square kilometers  covering what is now
  and parts of afghanistan and iran given that it was such a vast civilization you might expect to find really powerful rulers kings  and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings  in fact  
 what archeologists have found is none of that they 've found small objects such as these
 here 's an example
 of one of these objects well obviously this is a replica  but who is this person a king a god
 a priest or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me we don 't know  
 but the indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them  
 well no not pieces of plastic  but stone seals  copper tablets  pottery and surprisingly one large sign
 sign board which was found buried near the gate of a city  now we don 't know if it says hollywood or even bollywood for that matter  
 in fact  we don 't even know what any of these objects say 
 and that 's because the indus script is undeciphered  
 we don 't know what any of these symbols mean
 the symbols are most commonly found on seals so you see up there one such object it 's the square object with the unicorn like animal on it 
 now that 's a magnificent piece of art so how big do you think that is perhaps that big
  that big  well let me show you
 here 's a replica of one such seal  it 's only about one inch by one inch in size
 pretty tiny  so what were these used for we know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other so you know those
 packing slips you get on your fedex boxes these were used to make those kinds of packing slips you might wonder what these
 objects contain in terms of their text perhaps they 're the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other we don 't know 
 we need to decipher the script to answer that question
 deciphering the script is not just an intellectual puzzle  it 's actually become a question that 's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of
  asia  in fact the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people first  
 there 's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the indus script does not represent a language at all these people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find
  there 's a second group of people who believe that the indus script represents an indo european language if you look at a map of india today 
 you 'll see that most of the languages spoken in north india belong to the indo european language family  so some people believe that the indus script represents an ancient indo european language 
  such as sanskrit  there 's a last group of people who believe that the indus people were the ancestors of people living in south india today  these people believe that the indus script
  an ancient form of the dravidian language family  which is the language family spoken in much of south india today  
 and the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of dravidian speaking people in the north actually near afghanistan 
 and they say that perhaps sometime in the past dravidian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indus civilization is perhaps also dravidian
  which of these hypotheses can be true  
 we don 't know but perhaps if you deciphered the script you would be able to answer this question  
 but deciphering the script is a very challenging task first there 's no rosetta stone i don 't mean the software i mean an ancient artifact
 that contains
 in the same text both a known text and an unknown text we don 't have such an artifact for the indus script  and furthermore we don 't even know what language they spoke
  and to make matters even worse most of the text that we have are extremely short so as i showed you they 're usually found on these seals that are very very tiny 
 and so given these formidable obstacles one might wonder and worry
 whether one will ever be able to decipher the indus script  in the rest of my talk i 'd like to tell you about how i learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the indus script i
 've always been fascinated by the indus script ever since i read
  about it in a middle school textbook  
 and why was i fascinated well it 's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world  my career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist so in my day job  
 i create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions how the brain makes decisions how the brain learns and so on 
 but in two thousand and seven my path crossed again with the indus script
  when i was in india and i had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script  
 and so it was then that i realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists and so i jumped at that opportunity and i 'd like to describe some of the results that we have found or better yet 
 the first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing
 here are two texts that contain some symbols on them  can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right i
 'll give you a couple of seconds
 okay  right to left how many
  notice that there 's a cramping of signs  and it seems like four thousand years ago when the scribe was writing from right to left they ran out of space  and so they had to cram the sign 
  one of the signs is also below the the text on the top this suggests the direction of writing was probably from right to left  
  other properties of language does the script show
 languages contain patterns if i give you the letter q and ask you to predict the next letter what do you think that would be most of you said u  which is right  
 now if i asked you to predict one more letter what do you think that would be  
  could be i it could be a  but certainly not b c or d right  the indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns
  lot of text that start with this  diamond shaped symbol  and this in turn tends to be followed by this quotation marks like symbol  and this is very similar to a q and u example this symbol can in turn be followed by 
 these fish like symbols and some other signs  but never by these other signs at the bottom  and furthermore  there 's some signs that really prefer the end of texts such as this
  this sign in fact happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script
 given such patterns here was our idea the idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns  and so we gave the computer the existing texts and the computer learned 
  a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other  given the computer model we can test the model by
  so we could deliberately erase some symbols and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols here are some examples 
 you may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of wheel of fortune
  what we found was that the computer was successful  in seventy five percent of
 cases in predicting the correct symbol in the rest of the cases typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer
 there 's also practical use for this particular procedure  there 's a lot of these texts that are damaged here 's an example of one such text and we can use the computer model now to try to complete 
  this text and make a best guess prediction here 's an example of a symbol that was predicted  and this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze 
  model  so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard 
 i think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this
 such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy this is a physics and information theory term  but just imagine it 's a really random jumble of letters
 how many of you have ever spilled coffee
 on a keyboard 
  you might have encountered the stuck key problem so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there 's no variation at all language on the other hand 
 has an intermediate level of entropy  it 's neither too rigid  nor is it too random 
 what about the indus script
 here 's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences at the very top you find the uniformly random sequence which is a random jumble of letters and interestingly we also find the dna sequence
  from the human genome and instrumental music and both of these are very very flexible which is why you find them in the very high range  at the lower end of the scale you find a rigid sequence a sequence 
  of all a 's and you also find a computer program in this case in the language fortran which obeys really strict rules 
  of the linguistic scripts when this result was first published it was highly controversial  
 there were people who raised a hue and cry  and these people were the ones who believed that the indus script does not represent language  i even started to get some hate mail  my students said that i should really seriously consider getting some protection
  have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession 
 what does this result really show  
 it shows that the indus script shares an important property of language  
 so as the old saying goes 
 if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands  what other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language  
 well
  linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages so for example here 's the same sentence written in english and the same sentence written in dutch using the same letters of the alphabet
 if you don 't know dutch and you only know english
 and i give you some words in dutch you 'll tell me that these words contain some very unusual patterns some things are not right  
 and you 'll say these words are probably not english words the same thing happens in the case of the indus script the computer found several texts two of them are shown here that have
  unusual patterns  so for example the first text  there 's a doubling of this  jar shaped sign  this sign is the most frequently occurring sign in the indus script  and it 's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair
 why is that the case  we went back and looked at where these particular texts were found and it turns out that they were found very very far away from the indus valley they were found in present
  day iraq and iran  and why were they found there
 what i haven 't told you is that the indus people were very very enterprising they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived  and so in this case they were traveling by sea all the way to mesopotamia present day iraq 
 and what seems to have happened here is that the indus traders
  the merchants were using this script to write a foreign language it 's just like our english and dutch example and that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns 
  you see in the text that are found within the indus valley  this suggests that the same script the indus script  could be used to write different languages  the results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion
  if it does represent language  
 then how do we read the symbols that 's our next big challenge so you 'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans of insects of fishes of birds
 most ancient scripts use the rebus principle  
 which is using pictures to represent words  so as an example  here 's a word can you write it using pictures
  give you a couple seconds  got it
 okay great here 's my solution you could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf and that 's belief right 
 there could be other solutions
 in the case of the indus script  
 the problem is the reverse  you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense  so this is just like a crossword puzzle
 except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the
  are so high if you solve it my colleagues iravatham mahadevan and asko parpola have been making some headway on this particular problem and i 'd like to give you a quick example of
 parpola 's work here 's a really short text it contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish like sign  
 and i want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were
  attached to bundles of goods so it 's quite likely that these tags at least some of them contain names of merchants  
 and it turns out that in india there 's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth  in dravidian 
  languages the word for fish is meen which happens to sound just like the word for star  
  which is the dravidian word for the big dipper star constellation 
 similarly  there 's another sequence of six stars and that translates to aru meen which is the old dravidian name for the star constellation pleiades  
 and finally  there 's other combinations such as this fish sign with
 something that looks like a roof on top of it and that could be translated into mey meen which is the old dravidian name for
  it looks like we 're getting somewhere  but does this prove that these seals contain dravidian names based on planets and star constellations  
 well not yet so we have no way of validating these particular readings  but if more and more of these readings start making sense and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct then we know that we are on the right track
 today  we can write a word such as
 ted in egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script  because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century  
 the decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly 
 the mayans started speaking to us in the  20th century  but the indus civilization remains silent why should we care 
 the indus civilization does not belong to just the
  south indians or the north indians or the pakistanis  it belongs to all of us
 these are our ancestors yours and mine they were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history
 if we decipher the script  we would enable them to speak to us again 
 what would they tell us what would
 we find out about them about us  i can 't wait to find out thank you
