  i collaborate with bacteria and i 'm about to show you some stop motion footage that i made recently where you 'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment
 over the period of an hour  so what you 're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing and as they do so they create an electrical charge
  and this attracts metals from their local environment  and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria 
 one of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water 
 and the desalination process is one where we take out salts we can use it for drinking and agriculture
  removing the salts from water
  seawater through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe  
 so seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration technology  we take the water from the sea and we apply pressure
 and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane this
  but we 're also left with a concentrated salt solution or brine  but the process is very expensive and it 's cost prohibitive for many countries around the globe  
 and also the brine that 's produced
 is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea and this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it 's pumped back out into 
 so i work in singapore at the moment and this is a place that 's really a leading place for
 desalination technology  and singapore proposes by two thousand and
  sixty to produce [ nine hundred ] million liters per day of desalinated water  
 but this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine  
 and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play  so what we 're doing at the moment is we 're accumulating metals like calcium potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine  
 and this in terms of magnesium
 and the amount of water that i just mentioned  equates to a $ four point five billion
 mining industry for singapore a place that doesn 't have any natural resources  so i 'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn 't existed before  
 imagine a mining industry that doesn 't mean defiling the earth
 imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating
 and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine  and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube 
 a mining industry that is in harmony with nature  thank you
