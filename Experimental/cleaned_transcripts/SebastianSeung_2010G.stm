  we live in in a remarkable time  the age of genomics 
 your genome is the entire sequence of your dna your sequence and mine are
 slightly different 
 that 's why we look different  i 've got brown eyes  you might have blue or gray  but it 's not just  skin deep 
 the headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases 
 maybe even shape
 our personality or give us mental disorders our genes seem to have
 awesome power
  i would like to think that i am more than my genes  
 what do you guys think are you more than your genes audience yes 
 yes i think some people agree with me i think we should make a statement i think we should say it all together
  you guys are really great maybe you can humor me and say this
  you guys are so great you don 't even know what a connectome is and you 're willing to play along with me  i could just go home now  
 well so far only one connectome is known that of this
 tiny worm its modest nervous system consists of just three hundred neurons and in the
 a team of scientists mapped
 all seven thousand connections between the neurons 
 in this diagram every node is a neuron and every line is a connection this is the connectome of the worm c elegans 
 your connectome is far more complex than this
 because your brain contains one hundred billion neurons
  and ten thousand times as many connections 
 there 's a diagram like this for your brain but there 's no way it would fit on this slide your connectome contains one million times more connections
 than your genome has letters  that 's a lot of information  what 's in that information  
 we don 't know for sure but there are theories  since the 19th century
  neuroscientists have speculated
 that maybe your memories the information that makes you you
 maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain 's neurons 
 and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity maybe your personality and your intellect
 maybe they 're also encoded
 in the connections between your neurons and so now you can see why
  i proposed this hypothesis i am my connectome  
 i didn 't ask you to chant it because it 's true  i just want you to remember it 
 and in fact  we don 't know if this hypothesis is correct because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it 
 finding that worm connectome
 took over a dozen years of tedious labor and to find the connectomes of brains more like our own
  we need more sophisticated technologies that are automated that will speed up the process of finding connectomes  
 and in the next few minutes i 'll tell you about some of these technologies which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of of my collaborators 
 now you 've probably seen
 pictures of neurons before you can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes they extend long and delicate
  branches  and in short they look like trees  
 but this is just a single neuron in order to find connectomes we have to see all the neurons at the same time  
 so let 's meet bobby kasthuri who works in the laboratory of jeff lichtman at harvard university bobby is holding fantastically
  thin slices of a mouse brain and we 're zooming in by a factor of one hundred thousand times
 to obtain the resolution so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time  
 except you still may not really recognize them and that 's because we have to work in three dimensions  
 if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up we get a three dimensional image  
 and still you may not see the branches so we start at the top  and we color in the
  one branch in red  and we do that for the next slice
 and for the next slice and we keep on doing that slice after slice 
 if we continue through the entire stack we can reconstruct the three dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron 
 and we can do that for another neuron in green 
 and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations and these are what are called
 synapses let 's zoom in on one synapse and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron  you should see small circles
 these are called vesicles they contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter  
 and so when the green neuron wants to communicate it wants to send a message to the red neuron it spits out neurotransmitter 
 at the synapse the two neurons are said to be connected
  like two friends talking on the telephone  
 so you see how to find a synapse  how can we find an entire connectome well
 we take this three dimensional stack of images
 and treat it as a gigantic  three dimensional coloring book we color every neuron in in a different color 
 and then we look through all of the images find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse
 if we can do that throughout all the images  we could find a connectome  
 now at this point you 've learned the basics of neurons and synapses and so i think we 're ready to tackle
 one of the most important questions in neuroscience how are the brains of men and women different 
  according to this self help book guys brains are like waffles they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes  
 girls ' brains are like spaghetti  everything in their life is connected to everything else 
 you guys are laughing but you know this book changed my life 
 laughter but
  what 's wrong with this you already know enough to tell me what 's wrong with this this statement
  it doesn 't matter whether you 're a guy or girl  
 everyone 's brains are like spaghetti  
 or maybe really really fine capellini with branches 
 just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate one neuron touches many other neurons through their
  branches one neuron can be connected to so many other neurons because there can be synapses at these points of contact 
 by now you might have
 sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is  and so let 's do a series of comparisons to show you i assure you this is very tiny it 's just six microns on a side
  so here 's how it stacks up against an entire neuron and you can tell that really only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube 
 and a neuron  well  that 's smaller than brain  and that 's just a mouse brain
 it 's a lot smaller than a human brain  
 so when show my friends this sometimes they 've told me
  me you know sebastian you should just give up 
 neuroscience is hopeless 
 because if you look at a brain with your naked eye you don 't really see how complex it is but when you use a microscope finally the hidden complexity
 is revealed 
 in the 17th century the mathematician and philosopher blaise pascal wrote of his dread of the infinite  his feeling
  of insignificance at contemplating
 the vast reaches of outer space and as a scientist i 'm not supposed to talk about my feelings
 too much information professor
  but at times i have also felt despair why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity
 that it might well be infinite it 's absurd  how could we even dare to think
 that we might ever understand this  
  i persist in this quixotic endeavor  and indeed these days i harbor new hopes 
 someday a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse
 in a vast database of images and some day  
 artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome  
 i do not know but i hope that i will live to see that day
  because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time it will take the work of generations
 to succeed 
 at the present time my collaborators and i what we 're aiming for is much more modest just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain  
 but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that i
 am my connectome
 for now let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis that it 's actually worth taking seriously 
 as you grow during childhood and
 age during adulthood your personal identity changes slowly likewise every connectome
 changes over time  
 what kinds of changes happen
  like trees can grow new branches  and they can lose old ones 
 synapses can be created  and they can be eliminated 
 and synapses can grow larger  and they can grow smaller 
 second question what causes these
  it 's true to some extent they are programmed by your genes  but that 's not the whole story 
 because there are signals electrical signals that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across
 from branch to branch these signals are called neural activity and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity
 is encoding our thoughts  feelings and perceptions our mental experiences
 and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change  
 and if you put those two facts together  it means that your experiences can change your connectome  
 and that 's why every connectome is unique even those of genetically identical twins the connectome is where nature
 meets nurture
  it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome an idea that you may find empowering  
 what 's in this picture 
 a cool and refreshing stream of water you say what else is in this picture 
 do not forget
 that groove in the earth called the stream bed 
 without it the water would not know in which direction to flow 
 and with the stream  i would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity
 and connectivity 
 neural activity is constantly changing it 's like the water of
  it never sits still the connections of the brain 's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity
 flows  and so the connectome is like bed of the stream  
 but the metaphor is richer than that because
 it 's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water  but over long timescales
  the water also reshapes the bed of the stream and as i told you just now neural activity can change the connectome  
 and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights i will remind you that neural activity
 is the physical basis or so neuroscientists think of thoughts feelings and perceptions  and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness 
 neural activity is its water
  and the connectome is its bed 
 so let 's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science  
 suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work how will we go about testing the hypothesis i am my connectome 
 well  i propose a direct test let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes
  consider the memory
 of long temporal sequences of movements like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata  
 according to a theory that dates back to the 19th century such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain  
 because if the first neurons in the chain are activated through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons which are activated  and so on down the line
 like a chain of falling dominoes  and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements  
 so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes  
 but it won 't be easy  because they 're not going to look like this 
 they 're going to be scrambled up
  have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain  and if we can do that the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction
 of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain
 during memory recall  and if that were successful that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome
  you ever tried to
 wire up a system as complex as this 
 i hope not but if you have you know it 's very easy to make a mistake 
 the branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain  can anyone guess  what 's the total length of wires in your brain i
 'll give you a hint it 's a big number
 i estimate millions of miles 
 all packed in your skull  and if you appreciate that number  
 you can easily see there is huge potential for mis wiring of the brain and indeed the popular press
 loves headlines like anorexic brains are wired differently or autistic brains are wired differently
  these are plausible claims but in truth we can 't see the brain 's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true  
 and so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read
 mis wiring of the brain to see mental disorders
 in connectomes  
 sometimes
 the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication philosophers know this game
 very well  if you believe that i am my connectome  i think
 you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome  
 i mention this because there are prophets today who
 claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human
  species one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death
 by that practice known as cryonics 
 if you pay one hundred thousand dollars you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an arizona warehouse 
 awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you 
 should we ridicule the modern seekers
  of immortality calling them fools or will they someday chuckle
 over our graves 
 i don 't know i prefer to test their beliefs  scientifically  
 i propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain  we know that damage to the brain occurs
 after death and during freezing
  the question is has that damage erased the connectome  if it has there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains resurrection might succeed for the body  
 but not for the mind 
 on the other hand if the connectome is still intact  we cannot ridicule
 the claims of cryonics so easily  
 i 've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small and propels us to the world of the far future
  connectomes will mark a turning point in human history 
 as we evolved from our ape like ancestors on the african savanna what distinguished us was our larger brains 
 we have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies  
 eventually these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves
 by deconstructing
  and reconstructing our own brains i believe that this voyage of
  not just for scientists but for all of us and i 'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today thank you
