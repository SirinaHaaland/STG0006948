  this is an interview with a difference on the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words what i did was i
 asked bill and melinda to dig out from their archive some images that would help explain some of what they 've done
 do do a few things that way so we 're going to start
 here  
 melinda  when and where was this and who is that handsome man next to you melinda gates with those big glasses huh 
 this is in africa our very first trip the first time either of us had ever been to africa in the fall of one thousand nine hundred and ninety three we were already engaged to be married we married a few months later  
 and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see
  the savanna it was incredible bill had never taken that much time off from work 
 but what really touched us actually were the people
  and the extreme poverty we started asking ourselves questions does it have to be like this 
 and at the end of the trip we went out to zanzibar and took some time to walk on the beach which is something we had done a lot while we
  and we 'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from microsoft would be given back to society but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about well what might we do and how might we go about it ca so
 given that
 this vacation led to the creation of
  the world 's biggest private foundation it 's pretty expensive as vacations go
  i think we were excited that there 'd be a phase of our life where we 'd get to work together and
 figure out how to give this money back 
 at this stage
 we were talking about the poorest and could you have a big impact on them were there things that weren 't being done there was a lot we didn 't know
 our navet is pretty incredible when we look back on it but we had a certain enthusiasm that that would be
 the the phase the post microsoft phase
 would be our our 
 which bill always thought was going to come after he was sixty so he hasn 't quite hit sixty yet so some things change along the
  we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world and we kept saying to ourselves well that can 't be in the u s you just go down to the drug store and so we started 
 gathering scientists and started learning about population learning about vaccines learning about what had worked
  've got a big
 pot of money and a world full of so many different issues how on earth do you decide what to focus on bg well
 we decided that we 'd pick two causes whatever the biggest inequity was globally  
 and there we looked at children dying  children not having enough nutrition to ever develop  and countries that were really stuck because
  level of death and parents would have so many kids that they 'd get huge population growth and that the kids
 were so sick that they really couldn 't be educated and lift themselves up  so that was our global thing and then
 in the u s both of us have had amazing educations  and we saw that
  the way that the u s could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system and the more we learned the more we realized we 're not really fulfilling that promise and so we picked those two things  
 and everything the foundation does is focused there ca 
 so i asked each of you to pick an image that
 that you like that illustrates your work and melinda this is what you picked
 what 's this about mg so i one of the things i
  love to do when i travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women whether it 's bangladesh india lots of countries in africa and i go in as a western woman without a name i don 't tell them who i am  pair of khakis  
 and i kept hearing from women over and over and over the more i traveled i want to be able to use this shot i would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines and they would bring the conversation around to but what about
  the shot i get which is an injection they were getting called depo provera which is a contraceptive  
 and i would come back and talk to global health experts and they 'd say oh no contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world well you had to dig deeper into the reports and this is what the team came to 
  me with which is to have the number one thing that women tell you in africa they want to use stocked out more than two hundred days a year explains why women were
  saying to me i walked ten kilometers without my husband knowing it  and i got to the clinic and there was nothing there and so condoms were stocked in in africa because of all the aids work that the u s and others supported 
 but women will tell you over and over again i can 't negotiate a condom with my husband i 'm either suggesting he has aids
 or i have aids  and i need that tool because then i can space
  the births of my children and i can feed them and have a chance of educating them ca melinda you 're roman catholic and you 've
 often been embroiled in controversy over this issue  and on the abortion question on both sides really how do you navigate that mg 
 yeah  so i think that 's a really important
  which is we had backed away from contraceptives as a global community we knew that two hundred and ten million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives even the contraceptives we have here in the united states 
 and we weren 't providing them because of the political controversy in our country 
 and to me that was just a crime  and i kept looking around trying to find the person that would
  get this back on the global stage  
 and i finally realized i just had to do it and even though i 'm catholic  i believe in contraceptives just like most of the catholic women in the united states who report using contraceptives  and i shouldn 
  't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back we used to have consensus in the united states around contraceptives and so we got back to that global consensus and actually raised two point six billion dollars around exactly this
  my graph has numbers on it i really
 like this graph this is the the number of children
 who die before the age of five every year and what you find is really a phenomenal success story which is not widely
  known that we are making incredible progress we go from twenty million
 not long after i was born to now we 're down to about six million so this is a story
 largely of vaccines  smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year 
 that was eradicated so that got down to zero measles was killing a couple million a year that 's down to a few hundred thousand 
  is a chart where you want to get that that
 number to continue  and it 's going to be possible using the science of new vaccines getting the vaccines out to kids  
 we can actually accelerate the progress the last decade that number has dropped faster
 than ever in history  and
 so i just love the fact that you can say okay if we can invent new vaccines we can get them out there  use the very
  understanding of these things and get the delivery right 
 that we can perform a miracle ca i mean you do the math on this and it works out i think literally to thousands of kids ' lives saved every day compared to the
  on it 's a kid one kid at a time
  ninety eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters and yet people 's charity when they see a natural disaster are wonderful it 's incredible how people think okay that could be me and the money flows 
 these causes have been a bit invisible 
 now that
 the millennium development goals and various things are getting out there we are seeing some increased generosity
  goal is to get this well below a million which should be possible in in our lifetime ca maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big sad face to to get engaged 
 i mean you 've used it in your letter this year you used basically this argument to say that
 aid contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken that actually it has been effective
  take 
 there is some aid that was well meaning and didn 't go well
  there 's some venture capital investments that were well meaning and didn 't go well you shouldn 't just say okay because of that
 because we don 't have a perfect record  this is a bad endeavor you should look at what was your
  how are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy
 so these countries can take care of themselves and say wow this is going well and be smarter we can spend aid smarter it is not all a panacea  
 we can do better than venture capital i think including big hits like this ca
 traditional wisdom is that it 's pretty hard for married couples to work together 
 how have you guys managed
 had a lot of women say to me i really don 't think i could work with my husband that just wouldn 't work out you know we enjoy it and we don 't
 this foundation has been a coming to for both of us in its continuous learning journey  
 and we don 't travel together as much for the foundation actually as we used to
  bill was working at microsoft we have more trips where we 're traveling separately but
 i always know when i come home bill 's going to be interested in what i learned whether it 's about women or girls or something new about the vaccine delivery chain or this person that is a great leader 
 he 's going to listen and be really interested  and he knows when he comes home  even if it 's to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he 's learned  i 'm really interested and i think we have a really collaborative
  you were basically largely running the show six years ago i guess bill came on full time so moved from microsoft and became full time that must have been hard adjusting to
  there was way more angst for them than there was for me about bill coming i was actually really excited i mean bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in two thousand and six and it was really his 
  decision but again it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea 
  was exciting  yes the foundation employees had angst about that
  eleven o 'clock you 're away from work what comes up what 's the argument bg
 because we built this thing together from the beginning  
 it 's this great partnership  
 i had that with paul allen in the early days of microsoft  i had it with steve ballmer as microsoft got bigger and now melinda
  in even stronger equal ways is the partner so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to which groups are working well
  she 's got a lot of insight she 'll sit down with the employees a lot we 'll take the different trips she described  so there 's a lot of
 collaboration i can 't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or
  here 's the thing we come at things from different angles and i actually think that 's really good  so bill can look at the big data and say i want to act based on these global statistics for me i come at it from intuition i meet with lots of people on the ground
 and bill 's taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match and i think what i 've taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand can you actually deliver that vaccine
  can you get a woman to accept those polio drops in her child 's mouth because the delivery piece is every bit as important as the science so i think it 's been more a coming to over time towards each other 's point of view and quite frankly the work is better because of it ca 
 so in vaccines and polio and so forth you 've had some amazing successes
  what about failure though can you talk about a failure and maybe what you 've learned from it bg yeah fortunately we can afford a few failures because we 've certainly had them  
 we do a lot of
 drug work or vaccine work that you know you 're going to have
 different failures like we put out one that got a lot of publicity was asking for a better condom well we got hundreds of ideas  maybe a few of those will
 work out we were very nave certainly i was about a
  drug for a disease in india visceral leishmaniasis that i thought once i got this drug we can just go wipe out the disease well  turns out it took
 an injection every day for ten days it took three more years to get it than we expected and then there was no way it was going to get out there  
 fortunately we found out that if you go kill the sand flies
  you probably can have success there but we spent five years you could say wasted five years and about sixty million 
 on a path that turned out to have very modest benefit
 when we got there ca you 're spending  
 like a billion dollars a year in education i think something like that is anything  the story of what 's gone right there is quite a long and complex one
  there any
 failures that you can talk about mg 
 well i would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer and small schools definitely help they bring down the dropout rate they have less violence 
  and crime in those schools but the thing that we learned from that work and what turned out to be the fundamental key is a great teacher in front of the classroom if you don 't have an effective teacher in the 
  front of the classroom  i don 't care how big or small the building is you 're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be
 ca so melinda this is you and your eldest daughter
  jenn 
 and just taken about three weeks ago i think three or four weeks ago where was this mg so we went to tanzania jenn 's been to tanzania all our kids have been to africa quite a bit actually  and
 we did something very different which is we decided to go spend two nights and three days
  with a family
 anna and sanare are the parents
  they invited us to come and stay in their boma 
 actually the goats had been there i think living in that particular little hut on their little compound before we got there  
 and we stayed with their family and we really really learned what life is like in rural tanzania  and the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was
  profound and so let me just give you one explanation of that 
 they had six children  and as i talked to anna in the kitchen we cooked for about five hours in the cooking hut that day and as i talked to her she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children 
 it was a very loving relationship this was a maasai warrior and his wife  but they had decided to get married
  they clearly had respect and love in the relationship 
 their children their six children the two in the middle were twins thirteen a boy and a girl named grace
 and when we 'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that grace and her mother would do grace was not a child she was an adolescent but she wasn 't an adult she was very very shy  
 so she kept wanting to talk to me and jenn we kept trying to engage her but she was shy  
 and at night though when all the lights went out in rural tanzania and there was no moon that night
 the first night and no stars and jenn came out of our hut with her rei little headlamp on 
 grace went immediately and got the translator came straight up to my jenn and said when you go home can i have your headlamp so i can study at night ca oh wow 
 mg and her dad had told me how afraid he was
  that unlike the son who had passed his secondary exams because of her chores she 'd not done so well and wasn 't in the government school yet he said i don 't know how i 'm going to pay for her education i can 
  't pay for private school and she may end up on this farm like my wife so they know the difference that an education can make in a huge profound way ca i mean
  bringing up three children when you 're the world 's richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art
 how have you managed it  what 's been your approach bg well i 'd say overall
 the kids get a great education but you 've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they 're
  going to go and do and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them most of the money 's going to the foundation and
 help them find something they 're excited about we want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they
 they could go out and do nothing  and so far they 're fairly diligent excited to
  you 've obviously
 guarded their privacy carefully for obvious reasons
  i 'm curious why you 've given me permission to show this picture now here at ted mg well it 's interesting as they get older they so know that our family belief is about responsibility 
  that we are in an unbelievable situation just to live in the united states and have a great education  
  we do want people to know that we believe in what you 're doing mom and dad and it is okay to show us more so we have their permission to show this picture  and i think paul farmer is probably going to put it
  eventually in some of his work  but they really care deeply about the mission of the foundation too ca 
 they won 't have anything like that they need to have a sense that their own work is is meaningful and important  
 we read an article long actually before we got married where warren buffett talked about that 
 and we 're quite convinced that it wasn 't a favor either to society or or to
  speaking of warren buffett
 something really amazing happened in two thousand and six when somehow your only real rival for richest person in america suddenly turned around and agreed to give eighty percent of his
 fortune to your foundation how on earth did that happen  i guess there 's a long version and a short version of that we 've got time for the short version bg all right 
 well warren was a close friend
  he was going to have his wife suzie
 give it all away tragically she passed away before he did  
 and he 's big on delegation  and
 he said ca tweet that bg if he 's got somebody who is doing something well and
 is willing to do it at no charge
  it has been unbelievable it 's allowed us to
 increase our ambition in what the foundation can do quite dramatically   half the resources we have come from warren 's 
 you 've pledged that by the time you 're done more than or ninety five percent of your wealth will be given to the foundation
  you and warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give what more than half of their assets
 for philanthropy  how is that going bg 
 well we 've got about one hundred and twenty people
 who have now taken this giving pledge the thing
  's great is that we get together yearly and talk about okay do you hire staff what do you give to them we 're not trying to homogenize it i mean the beauty of philanthropy is this mind blowing diversity 
 people give to some things we look and go wow 
 but that 's great that 's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches including even in one
  we need more experimentation but it 's been wonderful meeting those people 
 sharing their journey to philanthropy how they involve their kids where they 're doing it differently
 and it 's been way more successful than we expected now it looks like it 'll just keep growing in size in the in the years ahead
 having people see that other people are making change with philanthropy i mean these are people who have created their own businesses put their own ingenuity behind incredible
  ideas if they put their ideas and their brain behind philanthropy  they can change the world and they start to see others doing it and saying 
 wow i want to do that with my own money to me that 's the piece that 's incredible 
 ca it seems to me it 's actually really hard for some people to figure out even how to remotely spend that much money on on something else 
  there are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people i 'm curious can you
 make the pitch  what 's the pitch bg well it 's the most fulfilling thing we 've ever done  and
 you can 't take it with you and if it 's not good for your kids let 's get together and brainstorm about what we can be done
  the world is a far better place because of the philanthropists of the
  and the u s tradition here which is the strongest is the envy of the world and part of the reason i 'm so optimistic is because i do think philanthropy is going to grow and 
  take some of these things government 's not just good at working on and discovering and and shine some light in the right direction ca 
  dent both in that problem and certainly in the perception of that problem is that a fair comment bg oh yeah if you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy it 's good it
 tries to balance out and that that 's just mg but you change systems in the u s we 're trying to change the education system so it 's just for everybody and it works for all students
  i really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of
 the trajectory your lives have taken and the the spectacular
 degree to which you have shaped the future  thank you so much for coming
