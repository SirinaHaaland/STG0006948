  a real you this might seem to you like a very odd question  
 because you might ask how do we find the real you how do you know what the real you is and so forth  but the idea
  there must be a real you  surely that 's obvious if there 's anything real in the world it 's you  
 well  i 'm not quite sure at least we have to understand a bit better what that means now certainly i think there are lots of things in our culture around us which sort of reinforce the idea
 that for each one of us we have a kind of a core an essence there is something about what it means to be you which defines you and it 's kind of
  the most kind of crude way in which we have it are things like horoscopes you know people are very wedded to these actually  people put them on their facebook profile as though they are meaningul you even know your chinese horoscope as well  
 there are also more scientific versions of this 
 all sorts of ways of profiling personality type  such as the  myers briggs tests for example i don 't know if you 've done those a lot of companies use these for
  you answer a lot of questions  and this is supposed to reveal something about your your core personality and of course the popular fascination with this is enormous in magazines like this 
 you 'll see in the bottom left corner they 'll advertise in virtually every issue some kind of personality thing and if you pick up one of those magazines it 's hard to resist isn 't it doing the test to find what is your learning style what is your
  is your working style  are you this kind of person or that so i think that we have a 
  idea
 that there is a kind of core or essence of ourselves to be discovered  and that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves something that 's the same throughout life well
 that 's
 the idea i want to challenge  and i have to say now i 'll say it a bit later but i 'm not challenging this just because i 'm weird  the challenge actually has a very very long and distinguished
  history here 's the common sense idea 
 there is you you are the individuals you are and you have this kind of core  now in your life what happens is that you of course accumulate different 
 experiences and so forth  so you have memories  and these memories help to create what you are you have desires maybe for a cookie  maybe for something that we don 't want to talk about at eleven o 'clock
  in the morning in a school  you will have beliefs this is a number plate from someone in america  i don 't know whether this number plate which says messiah one indicates that the driver believes in the messiah or that they are the messiah  
 either way they have beliefs about messiahs we have knowledge we have sensations and experiences as well it 's not just intellectual things 
 so this is kind of the common sense model  i think of what a person
  is there is a a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences  but the suggestion
 i want to put to you today is that there 's something fundamentally wrong with this model  and i can show you what 's wrong with one click which is there isn 't actually a
  there are memories desires intentions sensations and so forth  but
 what happens is these things exist  and they 're kind of all integrated they 're overlapped they 're connected in various different ways 
 they 're connecting partly and perhaps even mainly because
 they all belong to one body and one brain but there 's also a narrative a story we tell about ourselves the experiences we have when we remember past
  things we do things because of other things so what we desire is partly a result of what we believe and what we remember is also informing us what we know 
 and so really there are all these things like beliefs desires sensations experiences 
 they 're all related to each other  and that just is you
 common sense understanding  in some ways it 's a massive one it
 's the shift between thinking of yourself as a thing which has all the experiences of life  and thinking of yourself as simply that collection of all experiences in life you are the sum of your parts  
 now those parts are also physical parts of course brains bodies and
  if you have a heart transplant you 're still the same person if you have a memory transplant  are you the same person if you have a belief transplant would you be the same person  
 now this idea 
 that what we are the way to understand ourselves is as not of some permanent being which has experiences  but is kind of a collection of experiences 
 might strike you as kind of weird  but actually i don 't think it should be weird  in a way it 's common sense
 because i just invite you to think about by comparison 
  think about pretty much anything else in the universe maybe apart from the very most fundamental forces or powers  let 's take something like water   
 now my science isn 't very good
  we might say something like water has two parts hydrogen and one parts oxygen right 
  i hope no one in this room thinks that what that means is there is a thing called water 
 and attached to it are hydrogen and oxygen atoms and that 's what water is of course we don 't we understand very easily very straightforwardly that water 
  is nothing more than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged 
  we say the watch has a face  and hands  and a mechanism and a battery  
 but what we really mean is we don 't think there is a thing called the watch to which we then attach all these bits  
 we understand very clearly that you get the parts of the watch you put them together  and you create a watch  now if everything else in the universe is like this  why
  think of ourselves as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts  but somehow being a separate permanent entity which has those parts  
 now this view is not particularly new actually it has quite a long lineage you find it in buddhism  
 you find it in 17th 18th century philosophy going through to the current day  people like locke and hume  
 but interestingly it 's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience
 paul broks he 's a clinical neuropsychologist 
 and he says this we have a deep intuition that there is a core an essence there and it 's hard to shake off probably impossible to shake off  i suspect  but it 's true 
  that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together 
  and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self  
 you find that there isn 't a central control spot in the brain there is no kind of center where everything happens there are lots of different processes in the brain all of which operate in a way quite independently  
 but it 's because of the way that they relate that we get this sense of self
  we don 't exist it 's just that the trick is to make us feel that inside of us is something more unified than is really there  
 now you might think this is a worrying idea  
 you might think that if it 's true that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self no permanent essence  
 does that mean that really the
  self is an illusion  does it mean that we really don 't exist  
 there is no real you well a lot of people actually do use this talk of illusion and so forth these are three psychologists thomas metzinger bruce hood susan blackmore 
 a lot of these people do talk the language of illusion the self is an illusion it 's a fiction
 i don 't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it go back to the watch the watch isn 't an illusion  because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts 
  in the same way we 're not illusions either the fact that we are  in some ways just this very very complex
  now
 if you take something like this you can appreciate the fact that in lots of ways  there 's nothing permanent about this for one thing it 's always changing the waters are always carving 
  new  channels with changes and tides and the weather some things dry up 
 new things are created of course the water that flows through the waterfall is different every single instance
 but it doesn 't mean that the iguazu falls are an illusion it doesn 't mean it 's not real 
 what it means is we have to understand what it is as something which has a history has certain things that keep it together  
 but it 's a process it 's fluid it 's forever changing  
 now that i think is a model for understanding ourselves and i think it 's a
  if you think that you have this fixed permanent essence which is always the same throughout your life no matter what  in a sense you 're kind of trapped
  you 're born with an essence that 's what you are until you die  if you believe in an afterlife maybe you continue  but if you think of yourself
 as being in a way not a thing as such but a kind of a process something
  i think that 's quite liberating because unlike the the waterfalls we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree 
 now we 've got to be careful here right  if you watch the x factor too much  you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be that 's not true i 've heard some fantastic 
  musicians this morning  and i am very confident that i could in no way be as good as them i could practice hard and maybe be good  but i don 't
  have that really natural ability there are limits to what we can achieve  there are limits to what we can make of ourselves  
 but nevertheless we do have this capacity to in a sense shape ourselves  
 the true self as it were then is not something that is just there for you to discover
  you don 't sort of look into your soul and find your true self what you are partly doing at least is actually creating your true self  
 and this i think is very very significant  particularly at this stage of life you 're at you 'll be aware of the fact how much of you changed over recent years if you have any videos of yourself three or four years ago  you probably feel embarrassed because you don 't recognize yourself
  your true self
