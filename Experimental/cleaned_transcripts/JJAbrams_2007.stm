  i wanna start today talk about the structure of a polypeptide
  why so many mysteries what is it about mystery that that i seem to be drawn to 
 and i was thinking about this what to talk about at ted when i talked to the the kind rep
 from ted and i said listen you know  what should i talk about he said don 't worry about it just be profound
  i took enormous comfort in that so thank you if you 're here  
 i was trying to think what do i talk about it 's a good question
  why do i do so much stuff that involves mystery and i started trying to figure it out and i started thinking about why do i do any of what i do and i started thinking about my grandfather 
 i loved
 my grandfather  harry kelvin
 was his name my mother 's father he died in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six he was an amazing guy and one of the reasons he was amazing after world war ii he began an electronics company
 selling surplus parts kits to schools and stuff  so he had this incredible curiosity  as a kid i saw him
 come over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things and he 'd open them up he 'd unscrew them and reveal the inner workings which
 many of us i 'm sure take for granted but
 it 's an amazing gift to give a kid to open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is he was the ultimate
 deconstructer
  in many ways  and my grandfather
 was a kind of guy who would not only
 take things apart but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts like
  you know  printing like the letter press i 'm obsessed with printing i 'm obsessed with silk screening and and bookbinding and box making when i was a kid i was always like taking apart
 boxes and stuff and last night in the hotel i took apart the kleenex box
  looking at it  and i 'm telling you 
 it 's a beautiful thing i swear to god i mean  when you look at look at the box and you sort of see how it works  rives is here and i met him years ago at a book fair he does pop up books and i 'm obsessed 
  with like  engineering of paper  but like the scoring of it the printing of it where the thing gets glued  you know the registration marks for the ink i just love
  my grandfather was sort of the guy who  you know kind of got me into all sorts of these things he would also supply me with tools he was this amazing encourager
 this patron sort of to
 make stuff  and he got me a super eight camera when i was ten years old 
 and in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six that was sort of an anomaly to be a 10 year old kid that had access to a camera and you know 
 he was so generous i couldn
  he wasn 't doing it entirely
 without some manipulation i mean i would call him and i 'd be like listen grandpa  i really need this camera you don 't understand this is like you know i
 want to make movies i 'll get invited to ted one day this is like and you know and my grandmother was the greatest because she 'd be like you know she 'd get on the phone
  had a synthesizer when i was fourteen years old
 this kind of stuff  and it it let me make things which to me was sort of the dream he sort of humored my obsession to other things too like magic the thing
 is we 'd go to this magic store in new york city called lou tannen 's magic it was this great magic store it was a crappy little
 building in midtown but you 'd be in the elevator the elevator would open there 'd be this little small magic store you 'd be in the magic store and it was just it was
  magical place so i got all these sort of magic tricks oh here i 'll show you this is the kind of thing so it would be like you know  
 right  which is good but now i can 't move 
 now i have to do this the rest of the thing like this i 'm like oh wow look at my computer over there anyway 
 so one of the things that i bought at the magic store was this  tannen
  mystery magic box  the premise behind the mystery magic box was the following fifteen dollars
 buys you fifty dollars worth of magic which is a savings 
 now i bought this decades ago and i 'm not kidding if you look at this you 'll see it 's never been opened 
 but i 've had this forever now i was looking at this it was in my office as it always is on the shelf and i was thinking why
 have i not opened this and why have i kept it because i
  rat i don 't keep everything but for some reason i haven 't opened this box  and i felt like there was a key to this somehow in talking about
 something at ted that i haven 't discussed before and
 bored people elsewhere so i thought maybe there 's something with this i started thinking about it and there was this giant question mark i love the design for what it 's worth of this thing  and i started thinking why haven 't i opened it and i realized that
  it represents potential  and what i love about this box  and what i realize i sort of do in whatever it is that i do
  is i
 i find myself drawn to
 infinite possibility that sense of potential and i realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination now it 's not the most ground breaking idea 
 but when i started to think that maybe there are times when mystery
 is more important than knowledge i started getting interested in this  and so i started thinking about lost and the stuff that we
  oh my god mystery boxes are everywhere in what i do in how in the creation of lost damon lindelof and i who created the show with me we were
 basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do we had eleven and a half weeks to write it cast it  crew it  shoot it  cut it post it turn in a two hour pilot 
 so it was not a lot of time and
 that sense of possibility what could this thing be there was no time to
 develop it i 'm sure you 're all familiar with those people who tell you what you can 't do and what you should change and there was no time for that which is kind of amazing and
 so we did this show and for those of you who you know who haven 't seen it or don 't know it i can show you this one little clip from the pilot just to show you some
  ten years ago  if we wanted to do that we 'd have to kill a stuntman  we 'd actually 
  it would be harder  it would take take two would be a bitch  so
 the amazing thing was we were able to do this thing and part of that was the amazing availability of technology knowing we could do anything i mean we could never have done that we might have been able to write it we wouldn 't have been able 
  to depict it like we did  and so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process technology is like mind blowingly inspiring to me i
  that blank page is a magic box
 you know  it needs to be
 filled with something fantastic i used to have the ordinary people script that i 'd flip through the romance of the script was amazing to me it would inspire me i wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of
 spirit and thought and emotion that that script
 i love apple computers i 'm obsessed so the apple computer like those the powerbook this computer right it challenges me it basically says what are you going to write worthy of me i guess i feel this
 and i often am like you know dude today i 'm out i got nothing you know 
 so there 's that in terms of the content of it you look at stories you think well  what are stories but mystery boxes there 's a fundamental question in tv  the first act is called the teaser  it 's literally the teaser it 's the big question so you 're drawn into it then of course there 's another question  and it goes on
  got the droids they meet the mysterious woman who 's that we don 't know mystery box you know  then you meet luke skywalker he gets the droid you see the holographic image you learn oh it 's a message you know she wants to  you know  find obi wan kenobi he 's 
  her only hope but who the hell 's obi wan kenobi mystery box  so then you go and he meets ben kenobi ben kenobi is obi wan kenobi holy shit you know so it keeps us have
  with mystery boxes that i started feeling compelled then there 's the thing of mystery in terms of of imagination
 the withholding of information you know  doing that intentionally
 is much more engaging whether it 's like the shark in
  and it 's loud and so they put the top up they 're in there you don 't hear anything they 're saying you can 't hear a word but it 's the most romantic date ever and you love it
 because you don 't hear it so to me there 's that and then finally  there 's this idea stretching the sort of
 paradigm a little bit but the idea of
 the mystery box meaning what you think you 're getting then what you 're really
  this kid who can 't find his way die hard right crazy great fun action adventure movie in a building  
 it 's about a guy who 's on the verge of divorce he 's showing up to l a tail between his legs there are great scenes maybe
  the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time but
 pretty great scenes there 's a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you 're you know expecting when you look at a movie like jaws 
 the scene that you expect we have the screen these are the kind of you know  scenes that you remember and expect from jaws and she 's being eaten 
 there 's a shark the thing about jaws is it 's really about a guy
 who is sort of dealing with his place in the world with his masculinity with his family how he 's going to you know make it work in this
  new town this is one of my favorite scenes ever  and this is a scene that you wouldn 't necessarily think of when you think of
  stuff
  so that 's the kind of stuff that like
  you know  the investment of character which is the stuff that really is inside the box you know  it 's why when people do sequels  or rip off movies you know of a genre they 're ripping off the wrong thing you 're not supposed to rip
  the shark or the monster you gotta rip off you know if you rip something off
 rip off the character rip off the stuff that matters i mean  look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you because ultimately you know  the mystery box
 is all of us so there 's that then the distribution what 's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater  
 you know  you go to the theater you 're just so excited to see anything the moment the lights go down is often the best part  you know  and you 're full of that amazing
 that feeling
  it 's a great movie you 're along for the ride ' cause you 're willing to give yourself to it  so to me  whether it 's that  whether it 's a tv an ipod computer cell phone
 it 's funny i 'm an as i said apple fanatic and one day about a year or so ago i was
 signing on online in the morning to watch steve jobs ' keynote ' cause i always do 
 and he came on he was presenting the video ipod and what was on the enormous ipod behind
  him lost i had no idea  and i realized holy shit it 'd come full circle like the inspiration i get from the technology is now using the stuff that i do inspired by it to sell technology i mean it 's nuts 
 i was gonna show you a couple of other things i 'm gonna skip through i just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything 
 this is something online i don 't know if you 've seen it before six years ago they did this this is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience but the point was that they were doing things
 that were
 using these mystery boxes that they had everyone has now what i 've realized is what my grandfather did for me when i was a kid 
 everyone has access to now  you don 't need to have my grandfather though you wished you had but i have to tell you
 this is a guy doing stuff on a quadra nine hundred and fifty computer 
 using infinity software they stopped making fifteen years ago he 's doing stuff that looks as as amazing as stuff i 've seen released from
  hollywood 
 the most incredible sort of mystery i think is now the question of what comes next because it is now democratized so now the creation of media is it 's everywhere the stuff that i was lucky and and
 begging for to get when i was a kid is now ubiquitous and so there 's an amazing sense of of opportunity out there and when i think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who
 would have been silenced you know who
  have been silenced in the past it 's a very exciting thing i used to say in classes and
 lectures and stuff to someone who wants to write go write do your thing it 's free you know you don 't need permission to go write but now i can say go make your movie there 's nothing stopping you from going out there and getting the technology you can lease rent buy
 stuff off the shelf
 that that is either as good  or just as good
 as the stuff that 's being used by the
 legit people no community is best served when only the elite have control  and i feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there when i did mission impossible iii we had amazing visual effects stuff ilm did the effects it was incredible and sort of like my dream
 to be involved  and there are a couple of sequences in the movie like these couple of moments
  have an obsession with big crazy explosions
 so my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one i 'm about to show you and it 's a scene in which tom 's character wakes up he 's drowsy he 's crazy and he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brain that he 's going to use later to kill him as bad guys do
  and i learned this very early on in my career don 't hurt tom 's nose 
 there are three things you don 't want to do number two is don 't hurt tom 's nose so eddie has this
  you gotta we have to make this look good and i realized that we had to do something ' cause it wasn 't working just as it was and i literally like  thought back to what i would have done using the super eight camera that my grandfather got me 
 sitting in that room  and i realized that hand didn 't have to be eddie marsan 's it could be tom 's
