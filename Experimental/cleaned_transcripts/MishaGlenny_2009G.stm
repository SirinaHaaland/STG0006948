  these are grim economic times fellow tedsters grim economic times indeed  
 and so i would like to cheer you up with one of the great albeit largely unknown commercial success stories of the past twenty years  comparable in its own very
  peculiar way to the achievements of microsoft or google  and it 's an industry which has bucked the current recession with
 equanimity  i refer to organized crime now
 organized crime has been around for a very long time i hear you say and these would be wise words indeed  but in the last two decades  it has experienced an unprecedented expansion
  now accounting for roughly fifteen percent of the world 's gdp i like to call it the global shadow economy or mcmafia 
 for short so what triggered this
 extraordinary growth in cross border crime well of course there is globalization technology  communications all that stuff which we 'll talk about
 a little bit later
  but first  i would like to take you back to this event  
 the collapse of communism all across eastern europe a most momentous episode in our post war history  now
 it 's time for full disclosure this event meant a great deal to me personally  i
  had started smuggling books across the iron curtain to democratic opposition groups in eastern europe  like solidarity in poland when i was in my teens i then started 
 writing about eastern europe  and eventually i became the bbc 's chief correspondent
 and so when four hundred and 
 million people finally won the right to choose their own governments i
  was ecstatic  
 but i was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall it wasn 't long for example before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in yugoslavia 
 and amongst the chaos  amidst the euphoria
  it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine 
 in eastern europe  continued to do so
 after the revolutions there obviously there were characters like this 
 but there were also some more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in eastern europe like this character remember these guys  they used to win the gold medals in
  weightlifting and wrestling every four years in the olympics  and they were the great celebrities of communism with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it they used to get great apartments 
  in the center of town casual sex on tap  and they could travel to the west very freely which was a great
  but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in eastern europe  or as i like to call them they are the midwives of capitalism 
 here are some of those same weightlifters after their one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine makeover 
 now
 in bulgaria this photograph was taken in bulgaria when communism collapsed all over eastern europe 
  it wasn 't just communism it was the state that collapsed as well that means your police force wasn 't working the court system wasn 't functioning properly so what was
  a business man in the brave new world of east european capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored well 
 he would turn to people who were called rather prosaically by sociologists  privatized law enforcement agencies 
 and in bulgaria the mafia was soon joined with fourteen thousand people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine and one thousand nine hundred and ninety one 
 now  
 when your state is collapsing your economy is heading south at a rate of knots 
 the last people you want coming on to the labor market are fourteen thousand men and women whose chief
  skills are surveillance are smuggling  building underground networks
 and killing people but that 's what happened all over eastern europe  now  when i was
 working in the 1990s i spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in yugoslavia and i couldn 't help notice that
  the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities  
 the paramilitary organizations were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates  
 and i came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise  
 and so i resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal
  underworld by talking to policemen by talking to victims by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services  but above all else by talking to 
 the gangsters themselves and the balkans was a fabulous place to start why well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing  but also as they say in the retail trade it 's location
  and what i noticed at the beginning of my research that the balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world 
 heroin cocaine women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals and where were they heading  the european union which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization
  transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history eventually comprising some five hundred million people 
 and a significant minority
 of those five hundred million people
 like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes sticking fifty euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers
 organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business  it has zones of production like afghanistan and 
  columbia  it has zones of distribution like mexico and the balkans and then of course  it has zones of
  like the european union  japan and of course  the united states 
 the zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed 
 take mexico for example 
 six thousand people killed there in the last eighteen months as a direct consequence
  five million people
 have died there it 's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers but it 's the biggest conflict on this planet since the second world war and why is it 
 because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries
 in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources
 of the region 
 in the year two thousand 
 eighty percent of the world 's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern democratic republic of congo  
 now  coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone in almost every laptop and games console the
 congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons and the mafia would then would then sell it on to western markets  
 and it is this western desire to consume
 that is the primary driver of international organized crime 
 now  let me show you some of my friends in action caught conveniently on film by
  out the factory gate are very cheap the european union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world so if you can smuggle them into the e u there are very handsome 
 profits to be made  and i want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups 
  for seven years  twenty of these boats
 made the trip across the adriatic from montenegro to italy 
 every single night  and as a consequence of this trade  britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue  and instead that money went to underwrite the wars in yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous
  individuals 
 now italian police when this trade started had just two boats which could go at the same speed and this is very important because the only way you can catch these guys is if they 
 run out of gas  sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution and if the police intervened they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them
  from drowning rather than chasing
 the bad guys  so i have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys  
 and the answer is six vessels and remember  twenty of these speed boats were coming across the adriatic every single night  
 so what were these guys doing with all the money they were making well
  this is where we come to globalization  
 because that was not just the deregulation of global trade  it was the liberalization of international financial markets and
 boy  did that make it easy
 for the money launderers  the last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre in the
  we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business  and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering  and a lot of licit banks were also happy
 to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked  
 but at the heart of this is the offshore banking network
  these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade  and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime money laundering you have to get rid of them 
 on a positive note we at last have someone in the white house who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities
  and if anyone is concerned about what i believe is the necessity for
 new legislation regulation effective regulation  i say  let 's take a look at bernie madoff who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail 
 bernie madoff stole 
 billion dollars that puts him up there on the olympus of gangsters with the colombian cartels and the major
  russian crime syndicates  but he did this for decades in the very heart of wall street and no regulator picked up on it 
 so how many other madoffs are there on wall street or in the city of london fleecing ordinary folk
 and
 money laundering  well i can tell you it 's quite a few of them  let me go on to the one
  organized crime now and that is narcotics our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning this one however is in central british columbia where i photographed it it 's one of the tens of thousands of 
 in b c which ensure that over five percent of the province 's gdp is accounted for by this trade  now i was taken
 by
  inspector brian cantera of the royal canadian mounted police to a cavernous warehouse east of vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated 
 by the rcmp from the smugglers who are sending it of course down south to the united states
  as it 's called in part because it 's marketed as organic which of course goes down very well in california 
 now  even by the police 's admission
 this makes not a dent in the profits really of the major exporters  since the beginning of globalization  the global narcotics market
  no concomitant increase in the resources available to
 police forces this however  may all be
 about to change because something very strange is going on the united nations recognized earlier this  it was last month actually
 that canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy
  and other synthetic drugs 
 interestingly the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing reproducing their highs
  now
 that is a game changer because it shifts production away from the developing world
 and into
 the western world
  that happens it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the west
  the drugs policy which we 've had in place for forty years is long overdue for a very
 serious rethink in my opinion now the recession  well organized crime has already adapted
  very well to the recession not surprising the most opportunistic industry in the whole world and 
 it has no rules to its regulatory system
 except of course  it has two business risks arrest by law enforcement which is frankly the least of their worries  and
 competition from other groups i e a bullet in the back of the head what they 've done is they 've shifted their operations people don 't smoke as much dope or visit prostitutes quite so frequently
 during a recession  and so instead they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way but above all 
 two sectors  and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime  
 and it 's been terribly successful  
 i would like to introduce you to  mr pringle  or perhaps i should say  more
  i was introduced to this bit of kit by a brazilian cybercriminal we sat in a car on the avenue paulista in so paulo  together hooked it up to my laptop and within about 
  five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major
  the technology the key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering or to use the technical term for it there 's one born every minute 
 you would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest  
 and it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this of course
  the quickest way to a person 's wallet
 is through the promise of sex and love i expect some of you remember the iloveyou virus one of the very great
 worldwide viruses that came i was very fortunate when the iloveyou virus came out because
 the first person i received it from was an ex girlfriend of mine  
  she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time but love was not amongst them 
 and so as soon as i saw this drop into my inbox i dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty
 infection  so cybercrime do watch out for it
 we do know that the internet is doing is the internet is assisting these guys these are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the 
  mosy has had a free meal at our expense  now  artesunate is a very effective drug at
  the malarial parasite is developing a resistance  and they fear that the reason why it 's developing a resistance is because cambodians can 't afford the drugs on the commercial market and so they buy it from the internet 
 and these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient which is why
  parasite is beginning to
 develop a resistance the reason i say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives 
  you don 't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime they affect our bank accounts they affect our communications our pension funds they even
  the food that we eat and our governments
