  i have given
 the slide show that that i gave here two years ago about two thousand times  
 i 'm giving a short slide show this morning that i 'm giving for
  i don 't want or need to raise the bar i 'm actually trying to lower the bar  because i 've cobbled this together to try to
 to meet the the challenge of this session and i was reminded by karen armstrong 's fantastic presentation
 that
  really properly understood is not about belief but about behavior  perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism 
 how dare we be optimistic 
 optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief an intellectual posture
 as mahatma gandhi famously said you must become the change you wish to see in the world
  and the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic
 is not going to be created by the belief alone  except to the extent that the belief
 brings about new behavior  
 but the word behavior is also i think sometimes misunderstood in this context  i 'm a big advocate of changing the
  lightbulbs and
 buying hybrids and tipper and i put thirty three solar panels on our house and dug the geothermal wells and did all of that
 other stuff but as important as it is to change the lightbulbs it is more important to change the laws  and when we change our
  in our daily lives we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part in order
 to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy 
 in order to solve the climate crisis  we have to solve the democracy crisis 
  and we have one  i have been trying to tell this story for a long time i was reminded of that recently by
 a woman who walked past the table i was sitting at just staring at me as she walked past 
 she was in her 70s looked like she had a kind face
  i thought nothing of it until i saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction also just staring at me  
 and so i said how do you do
 and she said you know if you dyed your hair black you would look just like al gore 
 many years ago when i was a young congressman i spent
 an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control the nuclear arms race  and the military historians
  taught me during that quest that military conflicts are typically
 put into three categories  local battles 
 regional or theater wars  and the rare but all important global world war
 strategic conflicts
  each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources a different
 approach 
 a different organizational model 
 environmental challenges fall into the same three categories  and most of what we think about are local environmental problems air pollution water pollution hazardous waste dumps  
 but there are also regional environmental
  like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast and from western europe to the arctic
 and from the midwest out the mississippi into the dead zone of the gulf of mexico and there are lots of those  but the climate crisis is the rare but all important global or strategic 
 conflict everything is affected  and we have to organize our response
  we need a worldwide global mobilization for renewable energy conservation  efficiency and a global transition to a low carbon economy  we have work to do  
 and we can mobilize resources and political will  
 but the political will has to be mobilized in order to mobilize the resources 
 let me show you these slides here  i thought i would start with the logo
 what 's missing here of course is the north polar ice cap greenland remains
 twenty eight years ago  this is what the polar ice cap
 the north polar ice cap looked like at the end of the summer at the fall
  this last fall i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder colorado  and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate
 laboratory  this is what 's happened in the last twenty eight years 
 to put it in perspective 
 two thousand and five was the previous record  here 's what happened last fall that has really
 unnerved the researchers
 the north polar ice cap is the same size geographically doesn 't look quite the same size but it is exactly the same size
 as the united states minus an area roughly equal to
 the state of arizona  the amount that disappeared in two thousand and five was equivalent to everything east of the mississippi  the extra amount
  that disappeared last fall
 was equivalent to this much it comes back in the in the winter  but not as permanent ice as thin ice vulnerable  
 the amount remaining
 could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years that puts a lot of pressure on greenland
  already around the arctic circle
 this is a famous village in alaska  this is a a town in newfoundland  
 antarctica latest studies from nasa  the
  snow melting of an area equivalent
 to the size of california 
 they were the best of times they were the worst of times 
 the most famous opening sentence in english literature i want to share briefly a tale of two planets 
 earth and venus are exactly the same size 
 earth 's diameter is about four hundred kilometers larger but
 essentially the same size they have exactly the same amount of carbon  but the difference
  is on earth most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere  deposited in the ground as
 coal oil natural gas etc on venus most of it is in the atmosphere  
 the difference is that our temperature is fifty nine degrees on average
  this is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible and putting it into the atmosphere  
 it 's not because venus is slightly closer to the sun it 's three times hotter than mercury which is right next to the sun  
 now briefly here 's an image you 've seen as one of the only old images but i show it because i want to briefly give you
  scientific community says 
 man made global warming pollution put into the atmosphere thickening this is trapping more of the outgoing infrared you all know that at the last ipcc summary  
 the scientists wanted to say how certain are you they wanted to answer that ninety nine percent the chinese objected  and so the compromise was more than ninety percent
  in this energy coming in from the sun if that were true  the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere  
 if it 's more coming in if it 's more being trapped on the way out then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here 
 here is the lower atmosphere
  here 's the good news sixty eight percent of americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming
 sixty nine percent believe that the earth is heating up in a significant way  there has been progress but
 here
  when given a list of challenges to confront  global warming is still listed
 at near the bottom what is missing is a sense of urgency 
  if you agree with the factual analysis but you don 't feel the sense of urgency where does that leave
  the alliance for climate protection which i head in conjunction with current tv who did this pro bono did a worldwide contest to do
 commercials on how to communicate this this is the winner
  on
  i 'll show all of the networks here the top
 journalists for nbc asked nine hundred and fifty six questions in two thousand and seven of the presidential candidates two of them were about the climate
  laughs to tears this is one of the older tobacco commercials so here 's what we 're doing  this is gasoline consumption in all of these countries
  and us 
 but it 's not just the developed nations  
 the developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace and actually their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we
  the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture we would still have this crisis  but we have given to the developing countries the
  and the ways of thinking that are creating the
  we have to stop this and the good news is that we can we have the technologies  we have to have a unified view of how to go
  the struggle against poverty in the world
 and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions all has a single very simple solution people say what 's the solution 
 here it is put a price on carbon  we need
  was invented by bismarck and some things have changed since the 19th century 
 in the poor world we have to integrate
 the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis  plans to fight poverty in uganda
 are mooted if we do not solve the climate crisis
 can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries  
 this is a proposal
 that has been talked about a lot in europe  this was from nature magazine these are concentrating solar  renewable energy
  to supply all of the electrical power to europe largely from
 developing countries  high voltage dc currents this is not pie in the sky  this can be done  
 we need to do it for our own economy 
 the latest figures show that the old model is not working there are a lot of great investments that you can make if
  you are investing in tar sands
 or shale oil  then you have a portfolio that is
 crammed with sub prime carbon assets  
 and it is based on an old model  junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse
  developing tar sands and
  coal shale
 is the equivalent here are just a few of the investments that i personally think
 make sense i have a stake in these so i 'll have a disclaimer there  but geothermal concentrating solar  advanced
 photovoltaics  efficiency and conservation you 've seen this slide before but there 's a change
 the only two countries that didn 't ratify
 and there was a campaign in australia
 that involved television and internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there  
 and we trained two hundred and fifty people to give the slide show in every town and village
  and city in australia 
 lot of other things contributed to it  
 but the new prime minister announced that his very first priority would be to change australia 's position on kyoto and he has 
 now they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have
  this is lake lanier 
 my friend heidi cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names we 'd call the one in the southeast now katrina and we would say it 's headed toward atlanta 
 we can 't wait
 for the kind of drought australia had to change our political culture 
 here 's more good news  the cities supporting kyoto in the u s are up to seven hundred and eighty and i thought i saw
  one go by there just to localize this
 which is good news now to close we heard a couple of days ago
 about the value of making individual heroism
 so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine
 what we need is another hero generation
 those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially  but also the rest of the world 
 have to somehow understand
 that history has presented us with a choice just as jill
  taylor
 was figuring out how to save her life
 while she was distracted
 by the amazing experience that she was going through  we now have a culture of distraction 
 but we have a planetary
  and we have to find a way
 to create in the generation of those alive today a sense of generational mission  
 i wish i could find the words to convey this  
 this was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet another
  gave women the right to vote 
 we can do this 
 don 't tell me that we don 't have the capacity to do it if we had just one week 's worth of what we spend on the iraq war we could be well on the way to solving this challenge  
 we have the capacity to do
  one final point  
 i 'm optimistic 
 because i believe we have the capacity 
 at moments of great challenge to set aside the causes of distraction
 and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us
 sometimes i hear people respond to the
 disturbing facts of the climate crisis
 by saying oh  this is so terrible what a burden we have 
 i would like to ask you to reframe that 
 how many
  generations in all of human history have had the opportunity
 to rise to a challenge
 that is worthy of our best efforts
 a challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do
  i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude
 that we are the generation
 about which a thousand years from now  philharmonic orchestras
 and poets and singers will celebrate
 by saying they were the ones
 that found it within themselves
 to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future let 's do that thank you very much
  there is deep pain that basically a design issue on
  issue on a voting form
 one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn 't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true 
 that hurts al gore 
 you have no idea ca 
 when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now i mean
  excited by their plans on global warming
 ag the answer to the question is is hard for me because 
 on the one hand i think that we should feel
 really great about the fact
  that the
 the republican nominee certain nominee john mccain and both of the
 finalists for the democratic nomination all three have a very different and forward leaning position on the climate
  all three have offered leadership
 and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration and i think that all all three have also been
 responsible in putting forward
 plans and proposals  but the
 the campaign dialogue that as illustrated by the questions that was put together by the league of conservation voters by the way the analysis of all the questions and
  the way the debates have all been sponsored by something
 that goes by the orwellian label clean coal 
 has anybody noticed that every single debate has been sponsored by clean coal now even lower emissions 
 the richness and fullness of fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative
 that is really needed so they 're saying the right things and they may whichever of them is elected may do the right thing but let me tell you  
 when i came back from kyoto
 in 
 with a feeling of great happiness that we 'd gotten that breakthrough there
  and then
 confronted the united states senate only one out of one hundred senators was willing to vote to confirm 
 to ratify that treaty whatever the candidates say
 has to be laid alongside what the people say 
 this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization co2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization literally 
 and now we mechanized that process
  changing that pattern requires
 a scope  
 a scale a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past so that 's why i began by saying 
 be optimistic in what you do but be
 an active citizen
  change the light bulbs but change the laws change the global treaties  we have to speak up we have to solve this this democracy
 this this
 we have sclerosis in our democracy  and we have to change that use the internet go on the internet 
 connect with people become very active as citizens have a
  which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources now nobody is talking on that scale  but i do believe that between now and november it is possible  this alliance for climate protection
 is going to launch a nationwide campaign grassroots mobilization television
  internet ads radio newspaper
 with partnerships with everybody from the girl scouts to the hunters and fishermen  we need help  we need help 
 ca in terms of your own personal role going forward  al  is there something more than that you would like to be doing ag i have
 prayed that i
 would be able to find the answer to that question what
  can i do  buckminster fuller once wrote if the future of all human civilization depended on me 
 what would i do 
 how would i be it does depend on all of us but again not just with the light bulbs 
 we 
  most of us here are americans we have a democracy
  we can change things  but we have to actively change what 's needed really is
 a higher level of consciousness  and that 's hard to that 's hard to create
 but it is coming there 's an old african proverb that some of you know that says if you want to go quickly go alone
  if you want to go far go together we have to go far quickly  so we have to have
 a change in consciousness 
 a change in commitment  a new sense of urgency  a new appreciation for the privilege that we have
 of undertaking this challenge ca al gore thank you so much for coming to ted
