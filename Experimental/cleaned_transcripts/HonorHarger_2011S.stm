  we all know what it looks like  we 've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives from the speculative images of science fiction
 to the inspirational visions of artists
 to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies 
 but whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space we have no sense of what space sounds like  
 and indeed most people associate space with silence  but the story of how we came to understand
  the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking 
 and yet despite this hardly any of us have ever heard space 
 how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star 
 well in case you 've ever wondered  this is what the sun
 sounds like
  is the planet jupiter
 pirouetting through the ice rings of saturn
  a highly condensed clump of neutral matter  spinning in the distant universe
  my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises
 emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe  
 and you may wonder  how do we know what these sounds are  how can we tell the difference between the sound of the sun and the sound of a pulsar
  answer is the science of radio astronomy 
 radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers  which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky  
 and just like the signals that we send and receive here on earth we can convert these transmissions into sound
  sound using simple analog techniques  
 and therefore  it 's through listening that we 've come to uncover some of the universe 's most important secrets
 its scale what it 's made of and even how old it is 
 so today  i 'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening it 's punctuated by three quick
 anecdotes which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space 
 now this story doesn 't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft  but a rather more humble technology
 and in fact the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution
 that we 're all part of today the telephone  it 's 
 it 's in boston  and this is alexander graham bell who was working with thomas watson on the invention of the telephone 
 a key part of their technical set up
 was a half mile long length of wire  which
 was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in boston 
 the line carried the telephone signals that would later make bell a household name  
 but like any long length of charged wire  it also inadvertently became an antenna 
 thomas watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles
 that his accidental antenna detected
  now you have to remember  this is ten years before heinrich hertz proved the existence of radio waves
 fifteen years before nikola tesla 's four tuned circuit nearly twenty years before marconi 's first broadcast  
 so thomas watson wasn 't listening to us we didn 't have the technology to transmit
  were these strange noises 
 watson was in fact listening to very low frequency radio emissions caused by nature 
 some of the crackles and pops were lightning but
 the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin 
 using the very first telephone
  watson was in fact dialed into the heavens 
 as he correctly guessed some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the sun  
 it was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to
 a phenomena which we can see at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet as the aurora  so
 whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications
  revolution watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves 
 he had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them
 fast forward fifty years and bell and watson 's technology
 has completely transformed global communications  but going from slinging
  some wire across rooftops in boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the atlantic ocean seabed
 is no easy matter  and so before long bell were looking to new technologies to optimize their revolution 
 radio could carry sound without wires but the medium is lossy it 's subject to a lot of noise and interference
  so bell employed an engineer to study those noises to try and find out where they came from with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec 
 which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony  
  were fairly prosaic in origin  they turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power
  but there was one persistent noise that jansky couldn 't identify  
 and it seemed to appear in his radio headset four minutes earlier each day  
 now
 any astronomer will tell you this is the telltale sign of something that doesn 't originate from earth  jansky had made a historic
  discovery 
 that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves  fifty years on from watson 's accidental encounter with the sun 
 jansky 's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration 
 the radio astronomy age 
 over the next few years
  astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers
 and learned about our radio sky about jupiter and the sun by listening let 's jump ahead again  it 's 
 and we 're back at bell labs  and once again  two scientists have got a problem with noise 
 arno penzias and robert wilson
 were using the horn antenna at bell 's holmdel laboratory to study the milky way
 with extraordinary precision they were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity 
 there was a glitch in their soundtrack 
 a mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research  
 it was in the microwave range  and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously
  this didn 't make any sense and like any reasonable engineer or scientist they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself it must be the dish  
 there were pigeons roosting in the dish  and so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings 
 get the disk kind of operational again  normal operations would resume  
 but the noise didn 't disappear 
 the mysterious noise that penzias and wilson were listening to
 turned out to be
  the oldest and most significant sound that anyone had ever heard  
 it was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe  
 this was the first experimental evidence that the big bang existed
 and the universe was born at a precise moment some fourteen point seven billion years ago  so
 our story
  ends at the beginning
 the beginning of all things the big bang  
 this is the noise that penzias and wilson heard the oldest sound that you 're ever going to hear the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang
