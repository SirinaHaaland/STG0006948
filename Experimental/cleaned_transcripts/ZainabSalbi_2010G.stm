  i woke up in the middle of the night
 with the sound of heavy explosion  
 it was deep at night  i do not remember what time it was i just remember the sound was so
 heavy and so very shocking
  everything in my room was shaking
 my heart my windows my bed  everything i looked out the windows
 and i saw a full 
 of explosion  i thought it was just like the movies but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that i was seeing
  full of bright
 red and orange and gray and a full circle of explosion and i kept
 on staring at it until it disappeared  
 i went back to my bed  and i prayed  and i secretly thanked god
 that that missile did not land on my family 's home
  that it did not kill my family that night  
 thirty years have passed  and i still feel guilty about that prayer 
 for the next day i learned that that missile landed on my brother 's friend 's home
 and killed him and his father but did not kill his mother or
  his sister 
 his mother showed up the next week at my brother 's classroom and begged 
 kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son for she had lost
 this is not a story of a nameless
  survivor of war and nameless refugees whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv
 with tattered clothes  dirty face scared eyes this is not
 a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war who we do not know their hopes their dreams their accomplishments
 families their beliefs their values this is my story  i
 was that girl  i am another image and vision
 of another survivor of war  i am that refugee and i am
  and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we 've only seen one side of it  
 we only talk about one side of it  
 but there 's another side
 that i have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it  i grew up with the colors
  of war
 the red colors of fire and blood  
 the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces
 and the piercing silver of an exploded missile so bright
 that nothing can protect your eyes from it  i grew up with the sounds of war
  the staccato sounds of gunfire  
 the wrenching booms of explosions ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens  
 these are the sounds you would expect but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds
 screeching in the night the
 high pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous
  iraq
 and founded a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survivors of wars
 in my travels and in my work from congo
 to afghanistan from sudan to rwanda i have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same  but the fears of
  you know there is a fear of dying  
 and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid it is very scary to go through that feeling of i am about to die or i could die in this explosion 
 but there 's also the fear
 of losing loved ones and i think
  too painful you don 't want to think about it but i think
 the worst kind of fear is the fear as samia a bosnian woman once told me who survived the four years besiege of sarajevo she said the fear of losing the ' i ' in me  
 the fear of losing the ' i
  that 's what my mother in iraq used to tell me it 's like dying from
 a palestinian woman once told me it is not about the fear of one death she said sometimes i feel i die ten times
 in one day as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets  she said but it 's not fair
  because there is only one life  and there should only be one death 
 we have been
 only seeing one side of war  
 we have only been discussing and consumed with high level preoccupations over troop levels  drawdown timelines surges and sting operations 
 when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric
 has been most torn 
 where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage
 just to keep life going  we have been so consumed
 with seemingly objective discussions of politics tactics weapons dollars and
 this is the language of sterility 
 how casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic 
 this is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities 
 eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children
  of modern war casualties
 are civilians seventy five percent of them are women and children how interesting  
 oh  half a million women in rwanda get raped in one hundred days or as we speak now  
 hundreds of thousands of congolese women are getting raped and mutilated how interesting these just become numbers that
  we refer to the front of wars is increasingly non human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies
 from space guiding missiles toward unseen targets  
 while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone
 attack hits a villager instead of an extremist
 it is a chess game 
 you learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership  checkmate  
 we are missing a completely other side of wars  
 we are missing my mother 's story who made sure with every siren with every raid
  with every cut off of electricity she played puppet shows for my brothers and i so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions  
 we are missing the story of fareeda 
 a music teacher a piano teacher in sarajevo who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in sarajevo
 and walked
 to that school  despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her and kept
 the piano the violin the cello playing the whole duration of the war  with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats 
 that was her fight that was her resistance  
  missing the story of nehia a palestinian woman in gaza who the minute there was
  in the last year 's war she left out of home  collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have in case there is no cease fire the day after  
 we are missing the stories of violet who despite surviving genocide in the church
  she kept on going on burying bodies cleaning homes cleaning the streets  
 we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars 
 do you know
 do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school
 and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going and the ones
  who are keeping that life are women 
 there are two sides of war  
 there is a side that fights  and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open 
 there is a side that is focused on winning battles  and there is a side that is
  there is a side that leads the front line discussion and there is a side that leads the back line discussion  
 there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting 
 and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs  
 there is a side that is led by men  and there is a side that is
  led by women and in order for us
 to understand how do we build lasting peace  
 we must understand war and peace from both sides  we must have a full picture of what that means 
 in order for us to understand what actually
  we need to understand as one sudanese woman once told me
 is the fact that my toenails are growing back again 
 she grew up in sudan in southern sudan for twenty years of war  
 where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees 
 many women were taken as slaves by rebels and
  as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers so that woman
 walked for twenty years so she would not be kidnapped again 
 and only when there was some sort of peace her toenails grew back again  
 we need to understand peace from a toenail 's perspective
  need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table  
 i find it amazing
 that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping 
 and the group of people who are mostly though not exclusively who are keeping life going in the midst of war are not included in
  the negotiating table  
 and i do argue that women lead the back line discussion but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion the doctors who are not fighting  
 the artists  the students the men who refuse to pick up the guns they are too excluded from the negotiating tables 
 there is no way we can talk about a lasting peace building of democracy
  sustainable economies any kind of stabilities if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table  not one 
 but fifty percent 
 there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we we don 't start investing in women and girls 
 did you know
 that one year of the world 's military
  spending equals seven hundred years of the u n budget
 and equals two thousand nine hundred and twenty eight years of the u n budget allocated for women 
 if we just reverse that distribution of funds  perhaps
 we could have a better lasting peace in this world
  last but not least we need to invest in peace
 and women not only because it is the right thing to do 
 not only because it is the right thing to do for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today  but it is for the future 
 a congolese woman who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them
 and saw
  her raped in front of them
 and mutilated in front of them and her children saw their nine year old sibling killed in front of them 
 how they 're doing okay right now  
 she got into women for women international 's program she got a support network she learned about her rights we taught her vocational and business skills we helped her get a job she was earning four hundred and fifty dollars she was doing okay she was sending them to school have a new home
 she said but what i worry about the most is not any of that i worry that my children have hate in their hearts  
 and when they want to grow up they want to fight again
 the killers of their father and their brother we need to invest in women because that 's our only chance
 to ensure that there is no more
  war in the future that mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do 
 are there good news of course there are good news there are lots of good news to start with  
 these women that i told you about are dancing and singing every single day  and if they can who are we not to dance 
 that girl that i told you about
  ended up starting women for women international group that impacted one million people sent eighty million dollars and i started this from zero nothing nada [ unclear ] 
 they are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances not because of it  
 think of how the world can be a much better place
 if for a change  we have a better equality  we have equality  
 we have a representation and we understand war  both from the
  you there 
 when the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about  
 ideas language even the phrase ' each other ' no longer makes any sense 
 i humbly add
 humbly add that out beyond the worlds of war and peace there
  is a field  and there are many women and men [ who ] are meeting there 
 let us make this field a much bigger place  let us all
 meet in that field  thank you
