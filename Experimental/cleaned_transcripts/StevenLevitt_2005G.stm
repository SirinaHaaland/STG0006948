  once upon a time there was a dread disease that afflicted children and in fact  among all the diseases that existed
 in this land it was the worst it killed the most children and along came a brilliant inventor a scientist who came up with a partial cure for that disease
  and it wasn 't perfect  many children still died but
 it was certainly better than what they had before  and one of the good things about this this cure was that
 it was free  virtually free  and was very easy to use but the worst thing about it was that you couldn 't use it on the youngest children on
  a consequence a few years later another scientist perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him  but building on the invention of the first one
 came up with a second a second cure  and the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and
 one year olds and
 the problem with this cure was
  it was very expensive and it was very complicated to use and although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly 
 almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end
  but what they did of course since it was so complicated and expensive they only used it on the  zero year olds and the one year olds 
 and they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two year olds and up and
 this went on for quite some time people were happy they had their two cures until a particular mother whose child had just turned two died of this disease
 and she thought to herself my child just turned two and until the child turned two i had always used
 this complicated expensive cure you know this treatment 
 and then the child turned two and i started using the cheap and easy treatment and i wonder and she wondered like all parents who lose children
  if there isn 't something that i could have done like keep on using that complicated expensive
 cure 
 and she told all the other people 
 and she said how could it possibly be that something that 's cheap and simple works as well as something that 's complicated and expensive 
 and the people thought you know you 're right it probably is the wrong thing to do
 to switch and use the cheap and simple solution and the government they heard her story
  and the other people and they said yeah  you 're right 
 we should make a law we should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children 
 and the people were happy  they were satisfied for many years this went along and everything was fine
 but
 then along came a lowly economist who had children himself  and he used the expensive and complicated
 treatment but he knew about the cheap and simple one and he thought about it
  expensive one didn 't seem that great to him so he thought i don 't know anything about science but i do know something about data  
 so maybe i should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive
 and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one 
 and lo and behold when he went through the data  he found that it didn 't look like the expensive complicated solution was any better than the cheap one 
 at least for the children who were two and older the
 the cheap one still didn 't work on the on the kids who were younger  and so he went forth to the people
 and he said 
 i 've made this wonderful finding it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution 
 and by doing so we could save ourselves three hundred million dollars a year and we could spend that on our children in other ways 
 and the parents were very unhappy
  this is a terrible thing because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing 
 and the government was very upset  and in particular the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought how can we hope to compete with something that 's essentially free we would lose all of our market 
 and people were very angry and they called him horrible names  and he decided that maybe he should
 leave the country for a few days and seek out some more intelligent
 and come and try and tell the story at that place  and so  anyway here i am it 's not a fairy tale
 it 's a true story about the united states today  and the disease i 'm referring to is actually
 motor vehicle accidents for children and the the free cure is adult seatbelts  and the expensive cure
  and what i 'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why i believe this to be true  that for for children two years old and up there really is no
 no real benefit proven benefit of car seats in spite of the
 the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it
 socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts
  and then talk about why what is it that makes that true  and then finally talk a little bit about about a third way about another technology which is probably better than anything we have but which there hasn 't been any 
  enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution 
  case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats so the united states keeps a data set of every fatal accident that 's happened since 
 so in every car crash in which at least one person dies they have information on all of the people so if you look at that data it 's right up on the
 the national highway transportation safety administration 's website
 you can just look at the raw data and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that 's in favor of car seats for
  aged two and up  
 so here is the data  here i have among two to  six year olds anyone above six basically no one uses car seats so you can 't compare 
 twenty nine point three percent of the children
 who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies  themselves die  
 if you put a child in a car seat  eighteen point two percent of the children die  if they 're wearing a lap and shoulder belt in this raw data nineteen point four percent
  die and interestingly wearing a lap only seatbelt  sixteen point seven percent die  and actually the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt 's got to be worse
 than the lap and shoulder belt and that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way  
 so what we do in the study is and this is just presenting the same information but turned into a
 figure to make it easier so the yellow bar represents
  car seats  the orange bar lap and shoulder and the red bar lap only seatbelts and this is all relative to unrestrained the bigger the bar the better okay so this is the data i just showed 
 ok so the the highest bar is what you 're striving to beat  so you can control for
 the basic things like how hard the crash was what seat the child was sitting in etc the age of the child and that 's that middle set of bars and so you can see that the
 seatbelts start to look worse once you do that and then finally the last set of of bars  which are really
 controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash 
 fifty seventy five one hundred different characteristics of the crash and
 what you find is that the car seats and the lap and shoulder belts when it comes to saving lives fatalities look exactly identical  and the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates
 as well  and it 's not
  just overall  it 's very robust to anything you want to look at one thing that 's interesting if you look at frontal impact crashes
 when the car crashes the front hits into something
 indeed what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better  and i think this isn 't just chance in order to have the car seat approved you need to pass certain federal
  all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash  but when you look at other types of crashes  like rear impact crashes  
 indeed the car seats don 't perform as well and i think that 's because they 've been optimized to pass as we always expect people to do to optimize relative to bright line rules
 about how how affected the the car will be  and the other thing you might argue is well car seats have got a lot better over time  and so if we look at recent crashes
  in the recent crashes the new car seats are far far better but indeed in recent crashes
 the lap and shoulder seatbelts actually are doing even better than the car seats  they say well that 's impossible that can 't be 
 and the line of argument if you ask parents is 
 but car seats are so expensive and complicated and they have this big tangle of of latches  how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated
  of an interesting logic i think that people use 
 and the other logic they say well  the government wouldn 't have told us [ to ] use them if they weren 't much better but what 's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very 
  much it really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two 
  in telling your story
 by using these abstract statistics and so i had some friends over to dinner
  and i was asking we had a cookout i was asking them what what advice they might have for me about
 about proving my point they said why don 't you run some crash tests and i said that 's a great idea so we actually tried to commission some crash tests and it turns
  as we called around to the independent crash test
 companies around the country
  none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said  some explicitly some not so explicitly all of our business comes from car seat manufacturers we can 't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats now eventually one did 
 under the conditions of anonymity they said they would be happy to do
  this test for us so anonymity and one thousand five hundred dollars per seat that we crashed
 and so we went to buffalo new york and here is the the precursor to it these are the
 crash test dummies  waiting for their chance to take the center stage  
 and then here 's how the crash test works here they don 't actually crash the entire car you know it 's not worth ruining a whole car to do it so they just have these bench seats and they strap
  the car seat and the seatbelt onto it so i just wanted you to look at this and i think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great look at the kid in the car seat does he not look content ready to go like he could survive 
  anything and then if you look at the kid in back it looks like he 's already choking before the crash even happens  it 's
  by the way  so here this is the car seat now watch two things watch how the head goes forward and basically hits the knees and this is in the car seat and watch how the car seat flies around 
 in the rebound up in the air the car seat 's moving all over the place  bear in mind there are two things about this this is a car seat that was
  installed by someone who has installed one thousand car seats who knew exactly how to do it and also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way
 to install car seats having a flat back makes it much easier to install them  and
 so so this is a test that 's very much rigged in favor of the car seat  ok so that kid in this crash fared very well the federal standards are that you have to score below a one thousand
 to be an approved car seat on this crash in some
 some metric
  of units which are not important  and this this crash would have been about a four hundred and fifty so this car seat was actually an above average car seat from consumer reports and did quite well  
 so the next one now this is the kid same crash who is in the seatbelt 
 he hardly moves at all actually relative to the other child 
 the funny thing is the cam work is terrible because they 've only set it up to do the car seats and so they actually don 't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that 's on the rebound 
 anyway  it turns out that those two
  crashes  that actually the three year old did slightly worse so he gets about a five hundred
 out of you know 
 on this range relative to a four hundred and something but still if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government and said i have invented a new car seat  i would like you to approve it for selling 
 then they would say this is a fantastic new car
  only got a five hundred it could have gotten as high up as a one thousand and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors
 into being approved as a car seat so in some sense what this is suggesting is that it 's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong which is putting children at risk it 's just that fundamentally the car seats aren 't doing much 
 so here 's the crash  so these are timed at the same time so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat at rebound it takes a lot longer but there 's just a lot less movement for
  in a car seat and it
 turns out that that looks terrible but that 's great that 's like a
 four hundred ok so that kid would do fine in the crash nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all and then here 's the the six year old
 in the seatbelt and in fact they get exactly within you know within one or two
  the car seat did absolutely nothing
 whatsoever that 's some more evidence  so in some sense i was criticized by
 a scientist who said you could never publish a study with an n of four meaning those four crashes  
 so i wrote him back and i said what about an n of forty five thousand and four because i had the other forty five thousand other real world crashes  and i just think that it 's interesting that
 that the idea of using real world crashes which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do
 something that scientists don 't actually usually think they would rather use a laboratory a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies than actually
 thirty years of data of what we 've seen with
 children and with car seats and so i think the answer to this puzzle
 is
 that there 's a much better solution out there that 's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so
  so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working  
 and if you  if you think from a design perspective about going back to square one and say i just want to protect kids in the back seat i
 don 't there 's anyone in this room who 'd say well the right way to start would be let 's make a great seat belt for adults  
 and then let 's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it
 in this daisy chain i mean why not start who 's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids but
 essentially do something like this which i don 't know exactly how much it would cost to do but there 's no reason i could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat it 's just actually you see this is folding up
 it 's behind the seat you 've got a regular seat for adults  and then you fold it down and the kid sits on top and it 's integrated it seems to me that this can 't be
 a very expensive solution  and it 's got to work better than what we already have  so the question is is there any hope for
 adoption of something like this which would presumably save a lot of lives  
 and i think the answer perhaps  lies in a story the answer both to why has a car seat been so successful 
 and
 why this may someday be adopted or not lies in a story that my dad told me 
 relating to when he was a doctor in the u s air force in england and this is a long time ago you were allowed to do things then you can 't do today
  would
 have patients come in who he thought
 were not really sick  
 and he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them and he 'd say come back in a week if you still feel lousy ok
 and most of them would not come back but some of them would come back and when they came back 
 he still convinced they were not sick had another jar of pills in this jar were huge horse pills
 they were almost impossible to swallow and these to me are the analogy for the
 car seats  people would look at these and say man this thing is so big and so hard to swallow if this doesn 't make me feel better you know what possibly could 
 and it turned out that most people wouldn 't come back because it worked
  but every once in a while there was still a patient
 convinced that he
 was sick
 and my dad had a third jar of pills  
 and the jar of pills he had he said  were the tiniest little pills he could find so small you could barely see them  
 and he would say listen i know i gave you that huge pill that complicated hard to swallow pill before  
 but now i 've got one that 's so potent that is really tiny and small and almost
  almost like this thing here which you can 't even see 
 and it turned out that never in all the times my dad gave out this pill
 the really tiny pill did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness  so my dad always took that as evidence that
 this little teeny powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect  and in some sense if that 's the right story 
 i think integrated car seats you will see very quickly becoming something that everyone has 
 the other possible conclusion is well maybe after coming to my
  father three times getting sent home with placebos he still felt sick he went and found another doctor
 and that 's completely possible and if that 's the case then i think we 're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come thank you very much audience i
 just wanted to ask you when we wear seatbelts we don 't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life
  it 's also to prevent lots of serious injury 
 your data looks at fatalities it doesn 't look at serious injury 
 is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury because that would prove your case steven levitt 
 yeah that 's a great question  in my data  and in another data set i 've looked at for new jersey crashes  
 i find very small differences
 in injury  so in this data it 's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belts in the new jersey data which
  is different because it 's not just
 fatal crashes but all crashes in new jersey that are reported it turns out that there is a ten percent difference in injuries but
 generally they 're the minor injuries now what 's interesting i should say  this as a disclaimer there is medical literature
 that is very difficult to resolve with this other data  which suggests that car seats are dramatically
