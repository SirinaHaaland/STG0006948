  the last time i heard my son 's voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school he called out one word in the darkness
  columbine high school  my son dylan and his friend eric killed twelve students and a teacher
 and wounded more than twenty others before taking their own lives  
 thirteen innocent people were killed  leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma 
 others sustained injuries some resulting in
 disfigurement and
  permanent disability  
 but the enormity of the tragedy can 't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place 
 there 's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts 
 there 's no way to
  assess the magnitude of a tragedy like columbine especially when it can be a blueprint for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own 
 columbine was a tidal wave  
 and when the crash ended it would take years for the community and for society to comprehend its impact 
 it has taken me years to try to accept my son
  the cruel behavior that defined the end of his life
 showed me that he was a completely different person from the one i knew  
 afterwards people asked how could you not know what kind of a mother were you 
 i still ask myself those same questions before the shootings i thought of myself as a good mom  helping
  my children become caring healthy responsible adults was the most
 important role of my life  but the tragedy convinced me that i failed as a parent  
 and it 's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today  
 aside from his father i was the one person who knew and loved dylan the most 
 if anyone could have known what was happening it should have been me right 
 but i didn 't know
 today i 'm here to share the experience of what it 's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts 
 for years after the tragedy  i combed through memories trying to figure out exactly where i failed as a parent  
 but there are no
 simple answers
 i can 't give you any solutions all i can do
 is share what i have learned  
 when i talk to people who didn 't know me before the shootings  i have three challenges to meet 
 first  when i walk into a room like this i never know if someone there has experienced loss
 because of what my son did i feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family who isn 't here
  to do it for himself  so first with all of my heart  i 'm sorry
 if my son has caused you pain  the second challenge i have
 is that i must ask for understanding and even compassion
 when i talk about my son 's death as a
  two years before he died  he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook that he was cutting himself  
 he said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life i didn 't know about any of this until months after his death  
 when i talk about his death
 as a suicide i 'm not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life
  trying to understand
 how his suicidal thinking
 led to murder 
 after a lot of reading and talking with experts 
 i have come to believe that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill
 but in his desire to die  the third challenge i have when i talk about my son 's
  is that i 'm talking about mental health
 excuse me
 is that i 'm talking about mental health 
 or brain health as i prefer to call it because it 's more concrete  
 and in the same breath  i 'm talking about violence the last thing i want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding that already exists around mental illness 
 only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other
  people but of those
 who die by suicide it 's estimated that about seventy five to maybe more than ninety percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind 
 as you all know very well our mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone 
 and not everyone with destructive thoughts fits the criteria
 for a specific diagnosis
 many who have ongoing feelings of fear
 or anger or hopelessness are never assessed or treated  too often they get our attention
 only if they reach a behavioral crisis if estimates are correct
 that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person when suicide
  rates rise as they are rising for some populations the murder suicide rates will rise as well  
 i wanted to understand what was going on in dylan 's mind prior to his death 
 so i looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss
  i did research and volunteered to help with fund raising events and whenever i could
  i talked with those who
 had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt one of the most helpful conversations i had was with a coworker
 who overheard me talking to someone else in my office cubicle 
 she heard me say that dylan could not have loved me if he could do something as horrible as he did  
 later when she found me alone she
  apologized for overhearing that conversation but told me that i was wrong 
 she said that when she was a young single mother with three small children 
 she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe 
 at the time she was certain
 that her children would be better off if she died
  so she had made a plan to end her life 
 she assured me that a mother 's love was the strongest bond on earth  and that she loved her children more than anything in the world  
 but because of her illness she was sure that they would be better off without her 
 what she said and what i 've learned from others is that we do not make the so called decision or choice
 to die by suicide in the same way that we choose what car to
  drive or where to go on a saturday night  when someone is in an extremely suicidal state they are in a stage four medical health
 emergency their thinking is impaired and they 've lost access to tools of 
 even though they can make a plan and act with logic
  their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain
 through which they interpret their reality 
 some people can be very good at hiding this state and they often have good reasons for doing that 
 many of us have suicidal thoughts at some point  but persistent ongoing thoughts of suicide
 and devising a means to die are symptoms of pathology  and like many illnesses  the condition has
  to be recognized and treated before a life is lost  
 but my son 's death was not purely a suicide  it involved mass murder  
 i wanted to know how his suicidal thinking
 became homicidal  but research is sparse and there are no simple answers  yes he probably had
  ongoing depression  he had a personality that was 
 and self reliant and that made him less likely
 to seek help from others he had experienced triggering events at the school
 that left him feeling debased and
  and he had
 a complicated friendship with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation and who was seriously
 disturbed  controlling and homicidal  
 and on top of this period in his life of extreme vulnerability and fragility 
 dylan found access to guns
 even though we 'd never owned any in our home
 it was appallingly easy for a 17 year old boy to buy guns  
 both legally and illegally  without my permission or knowledge 
 and somehow  seventeen years and many school shootings later  it 's still appallingly easy 
 what dylan did that day broke my heart
  and as trauma so often does it took a toll on my body and on my mind two years after the shootings i got breast cancer  
 and two years after that i began to have mental health problems 
 on top of the constant  perpetual grief
 i was terrified that i would run into a family member of someone dylan had killed or be
  accosted by the press
 or by an angry citizen 
 i was afraid to turn on the news  
 afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person  
 i started having panic attacks 
 the first bout started four years after the shootings  when i was getting ready
  for the depositions and would have to meet the victims ' families face to face 
 the second round started six years after the shootings  
 when i was preparing to speak publicly about murder suicide for the first time at a conference  
 both episodes lasted several weeks  
 the attacks happened everywhere in the hardware store in my office
  even while reading a book in bed 
 my mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror and no matter how i hard i tried to
 calm myself down or reason my way out of it i couldn 't do it  
 it felt as if my brain was trying to kill me and then being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts
  that 's when i learned firsthand what it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind  and that 's when i truly became a brain health advocate  
 with therapy and medication and self care 
 life eventually returned to whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances  
 when i looked back on all that had happened i could see that my son 's spiral
  into dysfunction
 probably occurred over a period of about two years plenty of time to get him help 
 if only someone had known that he needed help
 and known what to do 
 every time someone asks me how could you not have known it feels like a punch in the gut
 it carries accusation and taps into my feelings
 of guilt that no matter how much therapy i 've had
 i will never fully eradicate  but here 's something i 've learned if love were enough
 to stop someone who is suicidal from hurting themselves suicides would hardly ever happen but love is not enough
 and suicide is prevalent  it 's the second leading cause of death
 for people age ten to thirty four 
 and fifteen percent of american youth report having made a suicide plan in the last year  
 i 've learned that
 no matter how much we want to believe we can we cannot know or
  control everything our loved ones think and feel  
 and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else 
 can cause us to miss
 what 's hidden in plain sight 
 and if worst case
  have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing
 or for not asking the right questions
 or not finding
 the right treatment we should always assume that someone we love may be suffering regardless of
 what they say or how they act we should listen with our whole being without judgments  and without offering
  solutions  
 i know that i will live with this tragedy 
 with these multiple tragedies for the rest of my life  
 i know that in the minds of many 
 what i lost can 't compare to what the other families lost  i know my struggle doesn 't make theirs
  any easier  
 i know there are even some who think
 i don 't have the right to any pain  but only to a life of permanent penance 
 in the end what i know comes down to this the tragic fact
 is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to
  help  but for love 's sake  we must never stop trying to know the unknowable
