  thousand years later a mammoth died in southern germany
 a few centuries after that a griffon vulture also died in the same vicinity  
 and we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths  but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space
 did share one remarkable fate  after their deaths  a bone from each of their skeletons was crafted by human hands
 into a flute
  think about that for a second imagine
 you 're a caveman forty thousand years ago you 've mastered fire  you 've built simple tools for hunting you 've learned how to craft garments from animal skins to keep yourself warm in the winter 
 what would you choose to invent next
 it seems preposterous that you would invent the flute a tool that created useless
  vibrations in air molecules
 but that is exactly what our ancestors did now this
 turns out to be surprisingly common in the history of innovation  sometimes
 people invent things because they want to stay alive or feed their children or conquer the village next door  but just as often 
 new ideas come into the world simply because they 're fun
 and here 's the really strange thing many of those playful but seemingly frivolous inventions
 ended up sparking momentous transformations in science in politics and society 
 take what may be the most important invention of modern times 
 programmable computers  
 now  the standard story is that computers descend from military technology since many of the early computers were designed specifically to crack wartime codes or
 calculate rocket trajectories  but in fact  the origins of the
  modern computer are much more playful even musical than you might imagine the idea behind the flute of just pushing air through tubes to make a sound
 was eventually modified to create the first organ more than two thousand years ago  
 someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our
  to the piano  
 until the middle of the 19th century  
 when a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea of using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters  in fact  the very first typewriter
 was originally called the writing harpsichord 
 flutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs about a thousand
  years ago  at the height of the islamic renaissance  three brothers in baghdad designed a device that was an automated organ 
 they called it the instrument that plays itself now 
 the instrument was basically a giant music box  
 the organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder
 and if you wanted the machine to play a different
  song you just swapped a new cylinder in with a different code on it
  this instrument was the first of its kind 
 it was programmable 
 now conceptually this was a massive leap forward the whole idea of hardware and software becomes thinkable for the first time with this invention 
  powerful concept didn 't come to us as an instrument of war or of conquest or necessity at all it came from the strange delight
 of watching a machine play music 
 in fact  the idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by music for about seven hundred years 
 machines became the playthings of the
  used the same coded cylinders to control the physical movements of what were called automata an early kind of robot one of
 the most famous of those robots was you guessed it an automated flute player designed by a brilliant french inventor named jacques de vaucanson 
 and as de vaucanson was designing his robot musician he had another idea
  if you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth  
 instead of using the the pins of the cylinder to represent musical notes  they would represent threads with different colors  
 if you wanted a new pattern for your fabric  you just programmed a new cylinder
  this was the first programmable loom
  but a half century later  another french inventor named jacquard hit upon the brilliant idea
 of using paper punched cards instead of metal cylinders  paper turned out to be much cheaper and more flexible as a way of programming the device 
 that punch card system inspired victorian inventor charles babbage to create his analytical engine the first true programmable computer
 ever designed and punch cards were used by computer programmers as late as the 1970s 
 so ask yourself this question 
 what really made the modern computer possible  
 yes the military involvement is an important part of the story  but inventing a computer also required other
  harpsichord keyboards colorful patterns woven into fabric and
 that 's just a small part of the story  
 there 's a long list of world changing ideas and technologies that came out of play 
 public museums  rubber  probability theory the insurance business and many more necessity isn 't always the mother of invention  
 the playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory
  new possibilities in the world around us and that seeking
 is why so many experiences that started with simple delight and amusement eventually led us to profound breakthroughs  
 now  i think this has implications for how we teach kids in school and how we encourage innovation in our workspaces  
 but thinking about play and delight this way
 also helps us
  detect what 's coming next 
 think about it if you were sitting there in one thousand seven hundred and fifty trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th the 20th centuries automated machines computers artificial intelligence 
 a programmable flute
 entertaining the parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time it seemed like an amusement at best
 not useful in any serious way but it turned out to be the beginning of a tech revolution that would change the world
