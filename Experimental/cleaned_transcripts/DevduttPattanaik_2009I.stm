  to understand the business of mythology and what a chief belief officer is supposed to do you have to hear a story
 of ganesha 
  who is the scribe of storytellers  and his brother  the athletic warlord of the gods  kartikeya the two brothers
 one day decided to go on a race  three times around the world  
 kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around
 the continents
 and the mountains and the
  he went around once  he went around twice  he went around thrice  
 but his brother  ganesha  simply walked around his parents once
 if you understand the difference between ' the world ' and ' my world ' you understand the difference between logos and mythos '
 the world ' is objective  logical universal factual scientific '
 my world ' is subjective  it 's
  it 's personal  it 's perceptions thoughts feelings dreams  it is the belief system that we carry  it 's the myth that we live in '
 the world ' tells us
 how the world functions how the sun rises  how we are born ' my world ' tells us
 why the sun rises  why we were born
  every culture is trying to understand itself 
 why do we exist and every culture comes up with its own understanding of life 
 its own customized version of mythology 
 culture is a reaction to nature  and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of
  symbols and rituals which are always indifferent to rationality  and so when you study it you realize
 that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world  
 different people see things differently different viewpoints there is my world and there is your world 
 and my world is always better than your world  
 because my world you see is rational and yours is superstition  yours is faith
 yours is illogical 
 this is the root of the clash of civilizations  
 it took place once in three  hundred and twenty six b c 
 on the banks of a river called the indus  now in pakistan this river lends itself
 to india 's name 
  a young macedonian met there
 what he called a gymnosophist which means the naked wise man we don 't know who he was perhaps he was a jain monk  
 like bahubali over here the gomateshwara bahubali whose image is not far from mysore or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock staring at the sky and the sun and the moon
  alexander asked what are you doing and the gymnosophist answered i 'm experiencing nothingness 
 then the gymnosophist asked what are you doing and alexander said i am conquering the world 
 and they both laughed  
 each one thought that the other was a fool
  why is he conquering the world  it 's pointless 
 and alexander thought why is he sitting around doing nothing what a waste of a life 
 to understand this difference in viewpoints we have to understand
 the subjective truth of alexander his myth and the mythology that constructed it
  alexander 's mother his parents his teacher aristotle told him the story of homer 's iliad they told him of a great hero called achilles 
 who when he participated in battle  victory was assured  but when he withdrew from the battle  
 defeat was inevitable achilles was a man who could shape
  a man of destiny  and this is what you should be alexander that 's what he heard 
 what should you not be you should not be sisyphus 
 who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night 
 don 't live a life which is monotonous  mediocre
  be spectacular like the greek heroes  like jason 
 who went across the sea with the argonauts and fetched the golden fleece 
 be spectacular like theseus who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull headed minotaur 
 when you play in a race  win
  because when you win  the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come
 to the ambrosia of the gods 
 because you see the greeks believed you live only once  and when you die  you have to cross the river styx  
 and if you have lived an extraordinary life  
 you will be welcomed to elysium or what the french call
  heaven of the heroes  
 but these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard 
 he heard a very different story  
 he heard of a man called bharat  after whom india is called bhrata bharat also conquered the world  
 and then he went to the
  mountain of the center of the world called meru  and he wanted to hoist his flag to say i was here first 
 but when he reached the mountain peak he found the peak covered with countless flags
 of
 before him  each
  i was here first ' that 's what i thought until i came here 
 and suddenly in this canvas of infinity  bharat felt insignificant  
 this was the mythology of the gymnosophist  
 you see he had heroes  like ram raghupati ram
 and krishna govinda
  but they were not two characters on two different adventures they were two lifetimes of the same hero 
 when the ramayana ends the mahabharata begins when ram dies krishna is born when krishna dies eventually he will be back as ram  
 you see  the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead  but you don 't cross it once  
 you go to and fro endlessly  
 it was called the vaitarani
 you go again and again and again because you see nothing lasts forever in india not even death  
 and so you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built
 and worshiped for ten days and what do you do at the end of ten days  you dunk it in the river 
 because it has to end and next year she will come back
 what goes around always comes around and this rule applies not just to man but also the gods  
 you see the gods
 have to come back again and again and again as ram as krishna not only do they live infinite lives  but the same life is lived
  two different mythologies  
 which is right 
 two different mythologies two different ways of looking at the world  one linear one cyclical one believes this is the one and only life  the other believes
 this is one of many lives
  and so  the denominator of alexander 's life was one so the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements  
 the denominator of the gymnosophist 's life was infinity  so no matter what he did it was always
 zero  and i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero
 who knows 
 and that brings us to the mythology of business if alexander 's belief influenced his behavior  
 if the gymnosophist 's belief influences his behavior then it was bound to influence the business they were in
  you see  what is business
 but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves
  and if you look at cultures around the world all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business take a look 
 if you live only once in one life cultures around the world  you will see an obsession with binary logic  absolute truth standardization 
  linear patterns in design but if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic 
 with opinion with contextual thinking with everything is relative sort of 
 mostly laughter
 you look at art look at the ballerina how linear she is in her performance  and then look at the indian classical dancer  the kuchipudi dancer
  bharatanatyam dancer  curvaceous 
 and then look at business 
 standard business model vision  mission values processes  
 sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land 
 with the commandments held by the leader
  and if you comply  you will go to heaven 
 but in india there is no the promised land there are
 many promised lands  depending on your station in society  depending on your stage of life  
 you see  businesses are not run as institutions  by the idiosyncrasies of individuals  it 's always about taste  
  indian music for example does not have the concept of harmony there is no orchestra conductor 
 there is one performer standing there and everybody follows and you can never replicate that performance twice  
 it is not about documentation and contract it 's about conversation
 and faith  it 's not about compliance it 's about setting  getting the job done
 by bending or breaking the rules
 just look at your indian people around here you 'll see them smile they know what it is 
 and then look at people who have done business in india you 'll see the exasperation on their faces 
 you see this is what india is today the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view so it 's rapidly changing highly diverse chaotic
  unpredictable and people are okay with it  
 and then globalization is taking place  
 the demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in which is rooted in one life culture 
 and a clash is going to take place  like on the banks of the indus  it is bound to happen  
 i have personally experienced it i 'm trained as a medical
  doctor i did not want to study surgery don 't ask me why 
 i love mythology too much i wanted to learn mythology but there is nowhere you can study so i had to teach it to myself 
 and mythology does not pay well until now 
 so i had to take up a job and i worked in the pharma industry  
 and i worked in the healthcare industry  and i worked as a marketing guy and a sales guy and a knowledge guy
 content guy and a training guy i even was a business consultant doing strategies and tactics  
 and i would see the exasperation between my american and european colleagues when they were dealing with india  
 example  please tell us the process to invoice hospitals
  how do you put it in a nice little software you can 't 
 i would give my viewpoints to people but nobody was interested in listening to it  you see  until i met kishore biyani of the future group  you see he
 has established the largest retail chain called big bazaar 
 and there are more than two hundred formats across fifty cities and towns of india  and he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets
  and he knew very intuitively that best practices developed in japan and china and europe and america will not work in india 
 he knew that institutional thinking doesn 't work in india  individual thinking does he had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of india  
 so he had asked me to be the chief
  all i want to do is align belief sounds so simple  but belief is not measurable 
 you can 't measure it you can 't manage it so how do you construct belief how do you enhance the sensitivity of people to indian ness 
 even if you are indian it is not very explicit it is not very obvious so i
 tried to
 work on the standard model of culture which is develop
  symbols and rituals and i will share one of the rituals with you 
 you see it is based on the hindu ritual of darshan 
 hindus don 't have the concept of commandments so there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life so you 're not really sure how you stand in front of god 
 so when you go to the temple all you seek is an audience with god you want to see god 
 and you want god to see you and hence the gods have very large eyes large unblinking eyes  
 sometimes made of silver so they look at you because you don 't know whether you 're right or wrong and so all you seek
 is divine empathy just know where i came from why i did the jugaad 
 why did i do the setting why i don 't care for the processes just understand me  please 
 and based on this we created a ritual for leaders  after
  completes his training and is about to take over the store we blindfold him 
 we surround him with the stakeholders  
 the customer his family his team his boss 
 you read out his kra his kpi you give him the keys  and then you remove the blindfold and invariably  you see a tear  
 because the penny has dropped  
 he realizes
 that to succeed
  he does not have to be a professional he does not have to cut out his emotions  he has to include all these people
 in his world to succeed to make them happy to make the boss happy to make everyone happy  the customer is happy because the customer is god 
 that sensitivity is what we need once this belief
 enters behavior will happen business will happen  and it
  then we come back to alexander
 and to the gymnosophist and everybody asks me which is the better way 
 this way or that way and it 's a very dangerous question because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence 
 so i will not answer the question  what i will give you is an indian answer the indian
