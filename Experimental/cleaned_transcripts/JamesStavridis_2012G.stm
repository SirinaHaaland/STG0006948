  i 'm gonna talk a little bit about
 security  because we 've got to get better at security in this 21st century let me start by saying  let 's look back to the
  and kind of get a sense of
 how that style of security worked for us  
 this is verdun a battlefield in france just north of the nato headquarters in belgium 
 at verdun in one thousand nine hundred and sixteen over a 
 period  seven hundred thousand people were killed so about two thousand a day  
  the second world war you see the battle of stalingrad three hundred days two million people killed 
 we go into the cold war and we continue to try and build walls  we go from the trench warfare
 of the first world war
 to the maginot line of the second world war and then we go into the cold war  the iron curtain
  berlin wall walls don 't work  my thesis for us today
 is instead of building walls to create security we need to build bridges  this is a famous bridge in europe  it 's in 
 's the bridge over the drina river the subject of a novel by
  and it talks about how in that very troubled part of europe and the balkans over time there 's been enormous building of walls  
 more recently in the last decade we begin to see these communities start hesitatingly to come together  
 i would argue  again open source security is about connecting
  and lashing it together with strategic communication largely in social networks  
 so let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways  
 and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls  
 now i 'm a sailor
  this is a ship a liner clipping through the indian ocean  what 's wrong with this picture  
 it 's got concertina wire along the sides of it that
 's to prevent pirates from attacking it 
 piracy is a very active threat today around the world  this is in the indian ocean  piracy is also very active
 in the strait of malacca
  in the gulf of guinea  we see it in the caribbean it 's a 
  discontinuity in the global
 transport system  last year at this time there were twenty vessels  five hundred mariners held hostage  this is
 an attack on the global commons we need to think about how to address it let 's shift to a different kind of
  cyber sea  
 here are photographs of two young men at the moment they 're incarcerated they conducted a credit card
 fraud
 that netted them over ten billion dollars  this is part of cybercrime which is a
 just under the gdp of great britain  
 so this cyber sea which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness is very much under threat as well 
 another thing i worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking by the movement of narcotics
 here coming out of afghanistan through europe over to the united states we worry about cocaine coming from the andean ridge north  
 we worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking  above all perhaps we worry about human trafficking and the awful cost of it 
 trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons
  this is a photograph and i wish i could tell you
 that this is a very high tech piece of us navy gear that we 're using to stop the trafficking  
 the bad news is  this is a
 run by drug cartels it was built in the jungles of south america we caught it with that
 low tech raft 
 laughter and it was carrying six tons of cocaine crew of four sophisticated communications sweep  
 this kind of trafficking  in narcotics in humans in weapons god forbid in weapons of mass destruction is part of the threat to the global commons  
 and let 's pull it together in
  afghanistan today  this is a field of poppies in afghanistan 
 eighty to ninety percent of the world 's poppy  opium and heroin comes out of afghanistan  we also see there of course  terrorism 
 this is where al qaeda is staged from 
 we also see a very
 strong insurgency embedded
  so this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons  and what we must address 
 so here we are 21st century  we know our 
  tools are not going to work what should we do 
 i would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun
  we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun  
 we will need the application of military force when we do it we must do it well and competently 
 but my thesis is open source security is about international interagency private public connection
 pulled together
 by this idea of strategic communication
  on the internet  
 let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way  
 this is afghanistan these are afghan soldiers they are all holding books 
 you should say that 's odd  i thought i read that
 this demographic young men and women in their
 when they enter the security forces of afghanistan  why  because the taliban withheld education
 during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read so the question is so  why are they all standing there holding books  
 the answer is 
 we are teaching them to read
 in literacy courses
 by nato in partnership with
  private sector entities in partnership with development agencies 
 we 've taught well over two hundred thousand afghan security forces to read and write at a basic level
  when you can read and write in afghanistan you will typically put a pen in your pocket  
 at the ceremonies when these young men and women graduate they take that pen with great pride and put it in their
  pocket  this is bringing together international
 interagency these development agencies and private public to take on this kind of security now
 we are also teaching them combat skills of course but i would argue open source
 security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect  
 here 's another example  this is a us navy warship it
 's called the comfort  
 there 's a sister ship called the mercy  
 they are hospital ships this one the comfort  operates throughout the caribbean and the coast of south america
 conducting patient treatments on a typical cruise they 'll do four hundred thousand patient
  treatments  it is crewed not strictly by military
 but by a combination of humanitarian organizations operation hope  project smile other organizations send volunteers 
 interagency physicians come out they 're all part of this to give you one example of the impact this can have 
 this little boy
  years old walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the comfort  
 when he was fitted over his extremely myopic eyes he suddenly looked up and said
  treatments this
  collaboration with security forces and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way  
 here you see
 baseball players can you pick out the two us army soldiers in this photograph they
 are the two young men on either side of these young boys
 this is part of a series of baseball clinics where we have explored collaboration between major league baseball 
 the department of state who sets up the diplomatic piece of this 
 military baseball players  who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission  
 and they put on clinics throughout latin america and the caribbean in honduras
  in nicaragua 
 in all of the central american and caribbean nations where baseball is so popular  and it creates security  it shows role models to young men and women
 about fitness and about life that i would argue help create security for us 
 another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief
 a us air force helicopter participating after the tsunami in two thousand and four which killed two hundred and fifty thousand people 
 in each of these major disasters
 the tsunami in two thousand and four two hundred and fifty thousand dead  the kashmiri earthquake in pakistan
  the haitian earthquake about three hundred thousand dead  more recently the awful
  combination which struck japan and its nuclear industry in all of these instances we see partnerships
 between international actors interagency
  working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster so these are examples of this idea of open source security  
 we tie it together increasingly by doing things like this now  you 're looking at this thinking ah 
 admiral these must be sea lanes of communication  or these might be fiber optic cables no  
  to be involved we talked earlier about the arab spring and the power of all this i 'll give you another example and it 's how you move this message  i gave a talk like this in london a while 
  back about this point i said as i say to all of you i 'm on facebook friend me
  on the wire got picked up in two places in the world finland and indonesia  
 the headline was nato admiral needs friends thank you 
 which i do 
 laughter and the story was a catalyst and the next morning i had hundreds of facebook friend requests from indonesians and finns
  need a friend and oh by the way what is nato so yeah 
 we laugh but this is how we move the message and moving that message is how we connect international interagency private public 
 and these social nets to help create security  
 now let me hit a somber note  this is a photograph
  of a brave british soldier he 's in the scots guards he 's standing the watch in helmand in southern afghanistan  
 i put him here to remind us  i would not want anyone to leave the room thinking
 that we do not need capable competent militaries
 who can create real
  military effect that is the core of who we are and what we do and we do it to protect
 freedom freedom of speech all the things we treasure in our societies 
 but you know life is not an on and off switch you don 't have to have a military that is either in hard combat
 or is in the barracks  i would argue life is a rheostat you have to dial it in
  as i think about how we create security in this 21st century  there will be times
 when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis but there will be many instances as we 've talked about today where our militaries can be part of creating
  i would close by saying that
 we heard earlier today about wikipedia i use wikipedia all the time
 to look up facts and as all of you appreciate 
 wikipedia is not created by twelve brilliant people locked in a room writing articles wikipedia every day is tens of thousands
  of people inputting information and every day millions of people withdrawing that information  it 's a perfect image
 for the fundamental point that no one of us
 is as smart as all of us thinking together no one person no one alliance no one nation no one of us
 is as smart as all of us thinking together the vision
  statement of wikipedia
 is very simple a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge  my thesis for you
 is that by combining
 international interagency private public strategic communication together 
 in this 21st century  we can create the sum of all security
