  i 'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today
 about what i consider to be
 the biggest stunt on earth or perhaps not quite on earth  a parachute jump from the very edge of space 
 more about that a bit later on
  what i 'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride
 of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television 
 and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer
 in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they 've ever been before 
 i 've been a professional stunt man for thirteen years i 'm a stunt
  and as well as perform stunts i often design them  
 during that time health and safety has become everything about my job  
 it 's critical now that when a car crash happens it isn 't just the stunt person we make safe it 's the crew  
 we can 't be killing camera men  we can 't be killing stunt men  we can 't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set or any passerby 
 so safety
  but it wasn 't always that way in the old days of the silent movies harold lloyd here  hanging famously from the clock hands
 a lot of these guys did their own stunts they were quite remarkable they had no safety no real technology what safety they had was very scant  
 this is the first stunt woman  rosie venger an amazing woman you can see from the slide very very strong she really paved the way at
  time when nobody was doing stunts let alone women 
 my favorite and a real hero of mine is yakima canutt  yakima canutt really formed the stunt fight  
 he worked with john wayne and most of those old punch ups you see in the westerns yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated  this is a screen capture from stagecoach where yakima canutt 
  is doing one of the most dangerous stunts i 've ever seen there is no safety no back support no pads no crash mats no sand pits in the ground 
 talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date  some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts we couldn 't do them without technology 
 these are particularly dangerous
 because there is no mask on my face they were done for a photo shoot one for the sun newspaper one for fhm magazine highly dangerous but also you 'll notice it doesn 't look as though i 'm
 wearing anything underneath the suit  the fire suits of old the bulky suits the thick woolen suits have been replaced with modern materials
 like nomex or 
 more recently carbonex fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals to burn for longer look more spectacular and in pure safety here
 's a bit more 
 there 's a guy with a flame thrower there  giving me what for 
 one of the things that a stuntman often does and you 'll see it every time in the big movies is be blown through the air
 in the old days that 's all they had and that 's a ramp  spring off the thing and fly through the air and hopefully you make it look good now we 've got technology this thing is called an air ram  it 's a frightening piece of equipment 
 for the novice stunt performer because it will break your legs very very quickly if you land on it wrong  
 when you step on it either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot it will fire you depending on the gas pressure anything from five feet to thirty feet i could quite literally fire myself into the gallery which i 'm
 sure you wouldn 't want  
 not today car stunts are another area
 where technology and engineering advances have made life easier for us and safer  we can do bigger car stunts than ever before now being run over is never easy that
  but we have padding and fantastic  shock absorbing things like sorbothane the materials that help us when we 're hit like this not to hurt ourselves too much 
 the picture in the bottom  right hand corner there is of some crash test dummy work that i was doing showing how stunts work in different areas really  
 and testing breakaway signpost pillars a company makes a lattix pillar which is a network a lattice type pillar that collapses when it 's hit
  hit the car on the left drove into the steel pillar  
 and you can 't see it from there but the engine was in the driver 's lap they did it by remote control i drove the other one at sixty miles an hour exactly the same speed and clearly walked away from it  
 rolling a car over is another area where we use technology we used to have to drive up a ramp  and we still do sometimes
  but now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon you can just see underneath the car there is a black rod on the floor by the wheel of the other car that 's the piston that was fired out of the floor  we can flip lorries coaches  buses  anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power laughs
 it 's a great job really it 's such fun 
 you should hear some of the phone conversations that i have with people on my bluetooth in the shop well we can flip the bus over we can have it burst into flames and how about
  someone you know big explosion and people are looking like this 
 i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are 
 the next thing that i 'd like to show you is something that dunlop asked me to do earlier this year with our channel five 's fifth gear show 
 a loop the loop biggest in the world only one person had ever done it before 
 now the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be let 's hit this as fast as possible sixty miles an hour let 's just go for it foot flat to the floor
  that we went to cambridge university the other university  and spoke to
 a doctor of mechanical engineering there  a physicist who taught us that it had to be thirty seven miles an hour  even then i caught seven g
 and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in that 's a long way to fall if you get it wrong that was just about right so again science helps us and with the engineering too
 the modifications to the car and the wheel high falls  they 're old fashioned
  stunts what 's interesting about high falls is that although we use airbags and some airbags are quite advanced 
 they 're designed so you don 't slip off the side like you used to if you land a bit wrong  so they 're a much safer proposition  just basically though  it is a basic piece of equipment it 's a bouncy castle with slats in the side to allow the air to escape  that 's all it is 
  what 's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes  
 they used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them  and that 's interesting because they are almost retrospective  they 're great for catching you up to certain heights 
 and on the other side of the fence 
 that physical art  the physical performance of the stuntman has interfaced with the very highest technology
  and in software not the cardboard box but the green screen 
 this is a shot of terminator the movie two stunt guys doing what i consider to be a rather benign stunt it 's thirty feet it 's water it 's very simple 
 with the green screen we can put any background in the world on it  moving
 or still and i can assure you nowadays you can 't see the joint  
 this is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing completely in the safety of a studio  and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image
  that a skydiver took  and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by  
 decelerator rigs and wires we use them a lot 
 we fly people on wires like this this guy is not skydiving he 's being flown like a kite or moved around like a kite  
 and this is a guinness world record attempt they asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in two thousand and four and again technology meant that i could do the fastest abseil over
  hundred meters and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without melting the rope with the friction because of the alloys i used in the descender device  and that 's centre point in london
 we brought oxford street and tottenham court road to a standstill  helicopter stunts are always fun
 hanging out of them  whatever  and aerial stunts no aerial stunt would be the
  which brings us quite nicely to why i 'm really here today  project space jump in one thousand nine hundred and sixty  joseph kittenger of the united states air force
 did the most spectacular thing he did a jump from one hundred thousand feet one hundred and two thousand to be precise  and he did it to test high altitude systems
 for military pilots in the new range of aircraft that were going up to eighty thousand feet or so  
 and i 'd just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then and just how brave he was in
 project excelsior it was called there were three jumps  they first dropped some dummies 
 so that 's the balloon  big gas balloon it 's that shape because the helium has to expand 
 my balloon will expand to five hundred times and look like a big
 pumpkin when it 's at the top these are the dummies being dropped from one hundred thousand feet and there is the camera that 's strapped to them
  the curvature of the earth at that kind of altitude and i 'm planning to go from one hundred and twenty thousand feet  which is about twenty two miles you 're in a near vacuum
 in that environment 
 which is in minus fifty degrees so it 's an extremely hostile place to be  this is joe kittenger himself bear in mind ladies and gents this was one thousand nine hundred and sixty  he didn 't know if he would live
  or die this is an extremely brave man 
 i spoke with him on the phone a few months ago he 's a very humble and wonderful human being he sent me an email  saying if you get this thing off the ground
 i wish you all the best and he signed it happy landings which i thought was quite lovely he
 's in his 80s and he lives in florida he 's a tremendous guy  this is him in a pressure suit now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is
 when you get to thirty thousand feet
  when you get to thirty thousand feet
 you can really only use oxygen  above thirty thousand feet up to nearly fifty thousand feet you need pressure breathing which is where you 're wearing a g suit this is him in his old rock and roll jeans there  
 pushing him in 
 those turned up jeans
  you need a pressure suit you need a
 pressure breathing system with a g suit that squeezes you that helps you to breathe in and helps you to exhale  above fifty
  thousand feet you need a space suit a pressure suit  certainly at one hundred thousand feet no aircraft will fly not even
 a jet engine it needs to be rocket powered or one of these things a great big gas balloon  
 it took me a while it took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job  i 've found that team in america now  
 and it 's made of polyethylene so it 's very thin we will have two balloons for each of my test jumps  and two balloons for the main jump because they notoriously tear
  on takeoff they 're just so so delicate  this is the step off  he 's written on that thing the highest step in the world and what must that feel like 
 i 'm excited and i 'm scared both at the same time in equal measures  and this is the camera that he had on him
 as he tumbled
 before his drogue chute opened to
  a drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down you can just see them there popping open those are the drogue chutes he had three of them  i did quite a lot of research
  and you 'll see in a second there he comes back down
 to the floor 
 now just to give you some perspective of this balloon  
 the little black dots are people it 's hundreds of feet high  it 's enormous that 's in new mexico  that
 's the u s air force museum 
 and they 've made a dummy of him that 's exactly what it looked like my gondola will be more simple than that it 's a three sided box basically so i 've had to do quite a lot of training  
 this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains training in preparation for some high altitude jumps  
 this is what the view is going to be like at ninety thousand feet for me now you may think this is just
 a thrill seeking trip  a pleasure ride just the world 's biggest stunt  well there 's a little bit more to it than that trying to find
 a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that i never really expected when i set about doing this 
 i contacted a company in the states
 who make suits for nasa that 's a current suit this was me last year with their chief engineer that suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars  
  it weighs three hundred pounds and you can 't skydive in it so i 've been stuck for the past fifteen years i 've been trying to find a space suit that would do this job  or someone that will make one something revolutionary happened a little while ago 
 at the same facility  that 's the prototype of the parachute i 've now had them custom make one the only one of its kind in the world and that 's the only suit of its kind in the world it was made by a russian that 's designed most of the suits of the past
 eighteen years for the soviets  he left the company because he saw as some other people in the space suit industry
  emerging market for space suits for space tourists you know if you are in an aircraft at thirty thousand feet
 and the cabin depressurizes you can have oxygen if you 're at one hundred thousand feet you die 
 in six seconds you 've lost consciousness in ten seconds you 're dead your blood tries to boil it 's called vaporization the body swells up it 's awful  
 and so we we expect it 's not much fun  
  you need to put someone in a suit that 's not inflated  that 's connected to the aircraft then they 're comfortable they have good vision like this great big visor  and then if the cabin depressurizes
  while the aircraft is coming back down in whatever emergency measures everyone is okay  i would like to bring costa on if he 's here to show you the only one of its kind in the world  i was going to wear it  
  thank you costa this
 is the communication headset you 'll see on on lots of of space suits
  it 's a two layer suit  nasa suits have got thirteen layers
  this is a very lightweight suit it weighs about fifteen pounds it 's next to nothing especially designed for me  it 's a working prototype i will use it for all the jumps would you just give us a little twirl please  
 costa thank you very much
 and
 it doesn 't look far different when it 's inflated as you can see from the picture down there  i 've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel  which means that i can practice everything i need to practice in safety before i ever jump out of anything thanks very much costa
