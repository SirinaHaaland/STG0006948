  there 's currently over a thousand ted talks on the ted website and i guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic  except for me i 
  don 't agree with this i think we have a situation here  because if you think about it one thousand ted talks  
  ideas worth spreading  
 how on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas 
 even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand ted videos it would actually currently take you over two hundred and fifty hours to do so 
 and i did a little calculation of this the damage to the economy for each one who does this is around
  having seen this danger to the economy i thought we need to find a solution to this problem  here 's my approach to it all if you look at the current situation you have a thousand ted talks 
  each of those ted talks has an average length of about two thousand three hundred words  now take this together and you end up with two point three million words of ted talks which is about three bibles worth of
  obvious question here is does a ted talk really need two thousand three hundred words  isn 't there something shorter i mean if you have an idea worth spreading  surely you can put it into something shorter 
 than two thousand three hundred words the only question is  how short can you get what 's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a ted talk  
  worn were the best novel he had ever written  
 and i also encountered a project called six word memoirs where people were asked take your whole life and please sum this up into six words such as these here found true love married someone else or 
 living in existential vacuum it sucks i actually like that one
  so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words
  you don 't need more
  than six words for a ted talk we could have been done by lunch here laughter
 and if you did this for all thousand ted talks you would get from two point three million words down to six thousand so i thought this was quite worthwhile so i started asking all my friends please take your favorite ted talk and put that into six words  
 so here are some of the results that i received i think they 're quite nice for example dan pink 's talk on motivation which was pretty good if you haven 't seen it
  drop carrot drop stick bring meaning it 's what he 's basically talking about in those one hundred and eighty five minutes  or some even included references to the speakers such as nathan myhrvold 's speaking style or the one of tim ferriss which might be considered a bit strenuous at times 
 the challenge here is if i try to systematically do this i would probably end up with a lot of summaries but not with many friends in the end so i had to find a different method  preferably involving total strangers and
 luckily there 's a website for that called mechanical turk which is a website where you can post tasks that you don 't want to do yourself  such as please summarize this text for me in six words 
 and i didn 't allow any low cost countries to work on this but
 i found out i could get a six word summary for just ten cents which i think is a pretty good price even then  
  's not possible to summarize each ted talk individually because if you do the math you have a thousand ted talks you pay ten cents each you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks because some of 
  them will probably be or are really bad  so i would end up paying hundreds of dollars  so i thought of a different way by thinking well the talks revolve around certain 
  themes so what if i don 't let people summarize individual ted talks to six words  but give them ten ted talks at the same time and say please do a six word summary for that one
 i would cut my costs by ninety percent so for $
 sixty i could summarize a thousand ted talks into just six hundred summaries  which would actually be quite nice some of you might actually right now be thinking it 's downright crazy to have ten ted talks summarized into just six words  but it 's actually not 
 because there 's an example by
  statistics professor hans rosling i guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks he 's got eight talks online and those can basically be summed up into just four words because that 's all he 's basically 
  showing us our intuition is really bad he always proves us wrong  so people on the internet some didn 't do so well  and when i asked them to summarize the ten ted talks at the same time some took the easy route out they just had some general comment
  there were others and i found this quite cheeky they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i 'd been too much on google lately 
 and finally also i never understood this  some people really came up with their own version of the truth  i don 't know any ted talk that contains this but 
 oh well in the end however and this is really amazing for each of of those ten ted talk clusters that i submitted i actually received meaningful summaries here are some of my favorites for example for the ted talks about food someone summed this
  up into food shaping body brains and environment which i think is pretty good  or happiness striving toward happiness  = moving toward unhappiness so
 here i was i had started out with a thousand ted talks and i had six hundred six word summaries for those 
 actually it sounded nice in the beginning but when you look at six hundred summaries it 's quite a lot it 's a huge list so
 i thought i probably have to take this one step further here and
  create summaries of the summaries and this is exactly what i did so i took the six hundred summaries that i had 
 put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on ted com and asked people to do summaries of those 
 again there were some misunderstandings for example when i had a cluster of all the beautiful talks someone thought i was just trying to find the ultimate
  people were able to do it for example all the courageous ted talks people dying or people suffering was also one with easy solutions around or the recipe for the ultimate  jaw dropping ted talk flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer i mean that 's
 the essence of it all now
 i had my nine groups but i mean  it 's already quite a reduction but of course once you are that far you 're not really satisfied  i wanted to go all the way all the way
  the distillery starting out with a thousand ted talks  i wanted to have a thousand ted talks summarized into just six words which would be a ninety nine point nine nine nine seven percent reduction in content  and
 i would only pay
  so stay even below $ one hundred for it  so i had fifty overall summaries done this time i paid twenty five cents because
  i thought the task was a bit harder and
 unfortunately  when i first received the answers and here you 'll see six of the answers i was a bit disappointed because i think you 'll agree 
 they all summarize some aspect of ted but to me they felt felt a bit bland or they just had a
 certain aspect of ted in them  so i was almost ready to give up when
 one night i played around with these sentences and found out that there 's actually a beautiful
  of a thousand ted talks at the value of
