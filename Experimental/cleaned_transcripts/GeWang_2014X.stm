  i want to
 talk to you about one thing and just one thing only and
 this has to do with when people ask me what do you do to which i usually respond i do computer music
 a number of people just stop talking to me right then and there and the rest who are left usually have this blank look in their eye
 as if to say what does that mean and i feel like
 i 'm actually depriving them of information by telling them this  at which point i usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind which is 
 i have no idea what i 'm doing  which is true 
 that 's usually
  followed by a second thought which is  whatever it is that i 'm doing  i love it
 and today i want to 
 well  share with you something i love and also why  
 and i think we 'll begin with just this question  what is computer music and i 'm going to
  do my best to provide a definition
 maybe by telling you a story that goes through some of the stuff i 've been working on 
 and the first thing i think in our story is going to be something called chuck now 
 chuck is a programming language for music and
  it 's freely available and i like to think that it crashes equally well on all modern operating systems  and instead of telling you more about it
 by the way i 'm just going to nerd out for just a few minutes here so
 i would say don 't freak out in fact  i would invite all of you to join me in just geeking out if you 've never written a line of code before in your life 
 do not worry i 'll bet you 'll be able to
 come along on this first thing i 'm going to do is to make a sine wave oscillator 
  to the dac now this is kind of the abstraction for the sound output on my computer okay  so i 've connected myself into the speaker next i
 'm going to say my frequency is four hundred and forty hertz and i 'm going to let time
 advance by two seconds through this operation all right  so if i were to play this
  you would hear a sine wave at four hundred and forty hertz for two seconds okay
  kinds of really horrible single sine wave pieces of music with this  but i 'm going to do something that computers are really good at which is repetition  
 i 'm going to put this all in a while loop and you actually don 't need to indent but this is purely for aesthetic reasons it 's good practice 
 and when
 we do this 
  that 's going to go on for a while in fact it 's probably not going to stop until this computer disintegrates  and i can 't really empirically prove that to you but i hope you 'll believe me when i say that 
 i 'm going to replace this two hundred and twenty by
 to generate a random number between thirty and one thousand and send that to the frequency of me
  we 've reached something that i would like to think of as the canonical computer music  this is to me the sound that
  is this computer music  yeah i guess by definition it 's kind of computer music it 's probably not the kind of music you would listen to cruising down the highway
  using chuck we 've actually been building instruments in the stanford laptop orchestra  based right here
 at stanford center for computer research in music and acoustics 
 now the laptop orchestra is an ensemble of laptops  humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays now the reason we have these
 is so that for the instruments that we create out of the laptop we want the sound to come out of somewhere near the instrument and the performer kind of much
  like a traditional acoustic instrument like if i were to play a violin here the sound would naturally not come out of the p a system 
 but from the artifact itself so these
 these speakers are meant to emulate that in fact i 'm going to show you how we
 actually built them the first step is to go to ikea and buy a salad bowl
  i actually use one of these to make salad at home as well i kid you not and the first step is you turn it upside down  
 and then you drill holes in them  six holes per hemi  and then make a base plate put car speaker drivers
 in them along with amplifiers in the enclosure and you put that all together and you have these
  add people add laptops you have a laptop orchestra  and
 what might a laptop orchestra sound like well let me give you a demonstration of
 about two hundred instruments we 've created so far for the laptop orchestra and what i 'm
 going to do is actually come over to this thing this thing i have in front of me actually used to be a commodity gaming
  this thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands it 's tethered to the base  and this will track the position of your hands in real time it was originally designed as a golfing controller
 to detect the motion of your swing that turned out to be
 a rather large commercial non success at which point they slashed prices to ten dollars at which point computer music researchers
 said this is awesome we can prototype instruments out of this
 me show you one instrument we 've created one of many and this instrument is called twilight and it 's meant to
 go with this metaphor of pulling a sound out of out of the ground so let me see if this will work
  this is a slightly metallic sound
  slightly different interaction the fourth one is a drone
  and i think you have to imagine that there 's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage  and i 'm going to bang it
  put that together you get something that sounds like this
 the
  from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the laptop orchestra and i think from the curiosity of wondering what if we
 took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people  
 plus then a healthy bout of insanity put those three things together led to me actually
 a startup company in two thousand and eight called smule now smule 's mission is to create expressive mobile music
 things and one of the first
 musical instruments we created is called ocarina and i 'm going to just demo this for you real quick
  english pendant configuration  and you 're literally blowing into the microphone
 to to make the sound and there 's actually a little chuck script running in here that 's detecting the strength of your blowing and also synthesizing the sound
 and vibrato is mapped to
 the accelerometer so you can get all right 
 so let me play a little little ditty for you a
 little bach
  let you take your time and figure out where your expressive
  a toy
 or it an instrument maybe it 's both  but for me i think the more important question is is it expressive 
 and at the same time i think creating these types of instruments asks a question about the role of technology and its place for how we make music apparently for example not that long ago
  hundred years ago that 's not that long in the course of human history families back then used to make music together as a common form of entertainment i don 't
 think that 's really happening that much anymore you know
 this is before radio before recording in the last hundred years with all this technology we now have more access to music as listeners and consumers but somehow  
 i think we 're making less music than ever before i 'm
  not sure why that would be maybe it 's because it 's too easy just to hit play and while listening to music is wonderful there 's a
 special joy to making music that 's all its own  and i think that 's one part of the goal of why i do what i do
 is
 kind of to take us
 back to the past a little bit  
 right now if that 's one goal the other goal is to look to the future and think about what kind of new musical things can we make that we don 't perhaps yet have names for
 that 's enabled by technology but ultimately
 might change the way that humans make music and i 'll just give you one example here and this is ocarina
 's other feature this
 is a globe   and here you 're actually listening to other users of ocarina blow into their iphones
  opened this up the first thought is that hey you know there 's somebody somewhere out there
 playing some music  and this is a small but i think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords
  as a final example  and perhaps my favorite example is that in the wake of the two thousand and eleven earthquake and
 tsunami disaster in japan a woman reached out in one of our singing apps
 to try to get people to join in to sing with her on a version of lean on me now in these apps there 's this thing that allows
 any user to add their voice to an existing performance by any other user or group of users so in some sense she 's created this kind of global ad hoc
  corral of strangers and within weeks  thousands of people joined in on this 
 and you can kind of see people coming from all around the world and all these lines converging on the origin where the first rendition of the song was sung and that 's in tokyo  
 and this is what it sounds like when there 's
  's something that you really couldn 't have done without computers  but at the same time it 's also
 just human  and i think
 what i 've essentially answered so far is maybe why i do the stuff that i do and let 's just finally return to the first question what
 is computer music and i think that the the catch here is that at least to me computer music isn 't really about computers it
  people it 's about how we can use technology to change the way we think
 and do and make music and maybe even
 add to how we can connect with each other through music and with that i want to say this is computer music  and thank you for listening
