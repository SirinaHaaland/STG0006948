  every group of female friends has the funny one the one you go to when you need a good cry  the one who tells you to suck it up when you 've had a hard day  
 and this group was no different 
  except that this was a community of groundbreaking women
 who came together first to become teammates then friends and then family in the least likely of places 
 on the special operations battlefield 
 this was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented not only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear  
 but by the fact that they were there at a time when women officially at least remained banned from ground combat and
  america had no idea they existed 
 this story begins with special operations leaders some of the most tested men in the united states military  saying we need women
 to help us wage this war america would never kill its way to the end of its wars it argued needed more knowledge
  and as everyone knows  if you want to understand what 's happening in a community and in a home you talk to women  
 whether you 're talking about southern afghanistan or southern california  
 but in this case  men could not talk to women because in a conservative and traditional society like afghanistan that would cause grave offense 
 so you needed women soldiers out there 
 that meant at this time in the war that the women who would be recruited to
  serve alongside army rangers and navy seals would be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent
 of the entire united states military  less than five percent 
 so the call went out female soldiers become a part of history join special operations on the battlefield
  and from alabama to alaska a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best  and to make a difference for their country  answered that call to serve 
 and for them it was not about politics it was about serving with purpose 
 and so the women who came to north carolina to compete for a spot on these teams which would put women
  on the special operations front lines  landed and found very quickly a community the likes of which they had never seen 
 full of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were and as driven to make a difference 
 they didn 't have to apologize for who they were and in fact they could celebrate it  
 and what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden there were lots of people
  like them as one of them said it was like you looked around and realized there was more than one giraffe at the zoo 
 among this team of standouts was cassie a young woman who managed to be an rotc cadet a sorority sister and a women 's studies minor all in one person  
  a west point track star who always ran and road marched with no socks and had shoes whose smell proved it 
 amber a heidi look alike who had always wanted to be in the infantry  and when she found out that women couldn 't be she decided to become an intel officer she
 served in bosnia and later helped the fbi to bust drug gangs in pennsylvania  
 and then there was kate who played high school football all four years and
  actually wanted to drop out after the first to go into the glee club  but when boys told her that girls couldn 't play football  she decided to stay for all the little girls who would come after her 
 for them biology had shaped part of their destiny  and put as cassie once said everything noble out of reach for girls 
 and yet here was a chance to serve with the best of the best on a mission that mattered to
  their country not despite the fact that they were female  but because of it 
 this team of women in many ways was like women everywhere  
 they wore makeup  and in fact they would bond in the ladies ' room over eyeliner and eye pencil  
 they also wore body armor  they would put fifty pounds of weight on their backs and board the helicopter for an operation  and they would come back and watch a movie called
 they even wore a thing called spanx because as they found very quickly the uniforms made for men were big where they should 
  be small and small where they should be big so lane an iraq war veteran you see her here on my left decided she was going to go on amazon and order a pair of spanx to her base so that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night
  these women would get together over video conference from all around afghanistan from their various bases  and they would talk about what it was like to be one of the only women doing what they were doing  
 they would swap jokes they would talk about what was working what wasn 't what they had learned to do well what they needed to do better  
 and they would talk about some of the lighter moments of being women out on the special operations front lines  including the shewee which was a tool that let you pee
  like a guy  although it 's said to have had only a forty percent accuracy rate out there 
 these women lived in the and 
 they proved you could be fierce and you could be feminine you could wear mascara and body armor you could love crossfit  and really like
  you could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies 
 women live in the and every single day  and these women brought that to this mission as well 
 on this life and death battlefield they never forgot that being female may have brought them to the front lines  but being a soldier is what would prove themselves there 
 there was the night amber went out on mission and in talking to the women of the house realized that there was a barricaded shooter
  lying in wait for the afghan and american forces who were waiting to enter the home 
 another night it was tristan who found out that there were pieces that make up explosives all around the house in which they were standing  and that in fact  explosives lay all the way between there and where they were about to head that night 
 there was the night another one of their teammates proved herself to a decidedly skeptical team of seals when she found the intel
  item they were looking for wrapped up in a baby 's wet diaper 
 and there was the night that isabel another one of their teammates found the things that they were looking for and received an impact award from the rangers who said that without her 
 the things and the people they were looking for that night would never have been found 
 that night and so many others they went out to prove themselves not only for one another but for everybody who would come
  after them  
 and also for the men alongside whom they served 
 we talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman 
 and in this case  next to these women stood men who wanted to see them succeed  
 the army ranger who trained them had served twelve deployments  and when they told him that he had to go train girls he had no idea what to expect
 but at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of two thousand and eleven  he told his fellow ranger we have just witnessed history  
 these may well be our own tuskegee airmen 
 at the heart of this team was the one person who everyone called
  called the best of us she was a
 petite blonde dynamo who barely reached five foot three and she was this wild mix of martha stewart  and what we know as g i jane  
 she was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband her kent state rotc sweetheart who pushed her to be her best and to
  and to test every limit she could  she also loved to put fifty pounds of weight on her back and run for miles  and she loved to be a soldier 
 she was somebody who had a bread maker in her office in kandahar and would bake a batch of raisin bread and then go to the gym and bust out twenty five or thirty pull ups from a dead hang  
 she was the person who if you needed an extra pair of boots or a home cooked dinner
 would be on your speed dial  because she never ever would talk to you about how good she was  but let her character speak through action 
 she was famous for taking the hard right
 over the easy wrong 
 and she was also famous for walking up to a 15 foot rope climbing it using only her arms and then shuffling away and apologizing because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs as the rangers had trained them
  some of our heroes return home to tell their stories  and some of them don 't 
 and on october twenty two two thousand and eleven  first lieutenant ashley white was killed alongside two rangers christopher horns
 and kristoffer domeij 
 her death threw this program built for the shadows into a very public spotlight because after all the ban on women in combat was
  still very much in place 
 and at her funeral  the head of army special operations came and gave a public testimony not just to the courage of ashley white  but to all her team of sisters 
 make no mistake about it he said these women are warriors  and they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female in the united states army
  ashley 's mom is a teacher 's aide and a school bus driver who bakes cookies on the side 
 she doesn 't remember much about that overwhelming set of days in which grief
 enormous grief
 mixed with pride  but she does remember one moment a stranger with a child in her hand came up to her
  i brought my daughter here today  because i wanted her to know what a hero was and i wanted her to know that heroes could be women
  who would come after them
