  i don 't know if you 've noticed but there 's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on
 the cognition and emotional life of dogs do they think
 do they feel and if so how so this afternoon in my limited time i wanted to take
 the guesswork out of a lot of that by introducing you to two dogs  
 both of whom have taken the command speak quite literally 
 the first dog is the first to go and
 he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner and the title is a dog on
  his master 
 as young as i look  i am growing older faster than he 
 seven to one is the ratio they tend to say  
 whatever the number i will pass him one day
 and take the lead the way i do on our walks in the woods 
 and if this ever manages to cross his mind it would be the sweetest shadow
 i have ever cast on snow or grass thank you 
 and our next dog
 speaks in something called the revenant which means a spirit that comes back
  i am the dog
 you put to sleep 
 as you like to call the needle of oblivion 
 come back to tell you this simple thing  i never liked you 
 when i licked your face  i thought of biting off your nose  when i watched you toweling yourself
  i wanted to leap and unman you with a snap 
 i resented the way you moved your lack of animal grace the way you would sit in a chair to eat a napkin on your lap a knife in your hand 
 i would have run away but i was too weak a trick you taught me while i was learning to sit and heel
 and greatest of insults  shake hands without a hand
  i admit the sight of the leash would excite me but only because it meant i was about to smell things you had never touched 
 you do not want to believe this but i have no reason to lie  
 i hated the car hated the rubber toys  
 disliked your friends and worse your relatives 
 the jingling of my tags drove me mad you always scratched me in the wrong place 
 all i ever wanted from you was food and water in my bowls 
 while you slept i watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky  it took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl 
 now  i am free of the collar
 free of the yellow raincoat  monogrammed sweater the absurdity of your lawn 
 and that is all you need to know about this place  except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner 
 that everyone here can read and write the dogs in poetry the cats and all the others
 in prose
