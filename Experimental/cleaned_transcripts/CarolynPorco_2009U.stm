  two years ago here at ted i reported
 that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small
 saturnine
  moon enceladus seen here this region seen here for the first time in the cassini image taken in two thousand and five 
 this is the south polar region with the famous  tiger stripe fractures crossing the south pole  and seen just recently in late two thousand and eight here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere
 is experiencing the onset of august and eventually winter  and i also reported that we 'd made this
 once in a lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole  consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane 
 and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the
  surface but we weren 't really sure  
 however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself
 were so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on enceladus we 've flown the cassini spacecraft
 by this moon now several times flying closer and deeper into these
  jets into the denser regions of these jets so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements  and we have found that the organic compounds coming from 
 this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported while they 're not amino acids we 're now finding things like propane and benzene
  hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde 
 and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from
 pockets of liquid water but that that liquid water is in contact with rock  
 and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain
  we are very encouraged by these results 
 and we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon 
 under the south pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms 
 whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter  and that will have to await the arrival back
 at
  of the spacecrafts  hopefully some time in the near future  specifically equipped
 to address that particular question but in the meantime i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to
 the saturnine system and visit the enceladus interplanetary geyser park just because we can  thank you
