  my dream is to build the world 's first underground park in new york city  now why would someone want to build an underground park  and why in new york city  
 these three tough little buggers
  on the left my grandmother age five  and then her sister and brother ages eleven and nine 
 this photo was taken just before they left from italy to immigrate to the united states 
 just about a century ago
  and like many immigrants at the time they arrived on the lower east side in new york city
 and they encountered a crazy melting pot what was amazing about their generation was that they were not only building new lives in this
  but they were also literally building the city  i 've always been fascinated by those decades and by that history  
 and i would often beg my grandmother to tell me as many stories as possible about the old new york  
 but she would often just shrug it off tell me to eat more meatballs more pasta  and so i very rarely got any of the history that i wanted to hear about 
 the new york city that i encountered
  i always knew as a kid that i wanted to make a difference and to somehow make the world more beautiful more interesting and more just 
 i just didn 't really know how 
 at first i thought i wanted to go work abroad so i took a job with unicef in kenya  but it felt weird to me that i knew more about local kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown i
 took a job with the city of new york but very quickly felt frustrated with the slowness of government bureaucracy  
 i even took a job at google
  very fast i drank the kool aid and believed almost wholeheartedly that technology could solve all social problems
  but i still didn 't feel like i was making the world a better place 
 it was in two thousand and nine that my friend and now business partner james ramsey alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site which is
 this this is the former
  trolley terminal
 that was the depot for passengers traveling over the williamsburg bridge from brooklyn to
 manhattan  and it was open between one thousand nine hundred and eight and one thousand nine hundred and forty eight just around the time when my grandparents were
 living right in the area  and we learned also that the site was entirely abandoned in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight 
 fascinated by this discovery we begged the authorities to draw us into the space 
  we finally got a tour  and this is what we saw 
 now this photo doesn 't really do it justice it 's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space it 's a football field of unused land
 immediately below a very crowded area of the city and it almost feels like you 're indiana jones on an archaeological dig  and all the details are all still there it 's really pretty remarkable 
  the site itself is located at the very heart of the lower east side 
 and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city 
 new york city has two thirds the green space per resident as other big cities  and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space  
 so we immediately started thinking about how we could take this site and turn it into something that could be used for the public but also could potentially even be green 
 our plan in a nutshell is to draw natural sunlight underground using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street
  directs it below the city sidewalks and would allow plants and trees to grow with the light that 's directed underneath 
 with this approach you could take a site that looks like this today
 and transform it into something
 that looks like this 
 in two thousand and eleven we first released some of these images  and what was funny was a lot of people said to us oh it kind of looks like the high line underground
  and
 so what our nickname ended up becoming and what ended up sticking was the lowline so the lowline was born 
 what was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel
  and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible  so like a crazy person i decided to quit my job and
 focus entirely on this project here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse  
 here 's the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology you can see the six solar collectors at the center there  
 and here 's the full exhibit all put together in this warehouse you can see the solar canopy overhead the light streaming in and this entirely live green space below 
 so in the course of just a few weeks tens of thousands of people came to see
 our exhibit and since that time we 've grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world 
 here 's a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the line 's site 
 and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next ten years  
 notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there 's really a lack of green space so what we 're proposing is really something
  that will add
 one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood but more importantly will introduce a really community driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area  
  and right now we 're focusing very closely on how we engage with the city of new york on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an
  here 's our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself 
 so here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city and invite people into this warm underground space 
 in the middle of winter when it 's absolutely freezing outside the last place you 'd want to go would be an outdoor space or outdoor park 
 the lowline would really be a four season space and a respite for the city  
 so i like to think that the lowline actually brings my own family 's story
  full circle  if my grandparents and my parents were really focused on building the city up and out i think my generation is focused on reclaiming the spaces that we already have  rediscovering our shared history and reimagining how we can make our communities
 more interesting more beautiful and more just thanks
