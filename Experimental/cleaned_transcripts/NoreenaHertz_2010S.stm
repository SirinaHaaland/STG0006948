  monday morning 
 in washington  
 the president of the united states is sitting in the oval office  assessing whether or not to strike al qaeda
 in yemen at number ten downing street david cameron
 is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs
 in order to stave off a double dip recession in madrid  maria gonzalez
 is standing at the door listening to her baby crying and crying trying to work out whether she should let it cry
 until it falls asleep
 or pick it up and hold it and i
 am sitting by my father 's bedside in hospital trying to work out whether i should let him drink the
  bottle of water that his doctors just came in came in and said you must make him drink today my father 's been nil by mouth for a week
 or whether by giving him this bottle i might actually kill him
  we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives  
 and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions we talk things over with our friends  we
 scour the internet we search through books  but
  even in this age of google and tripadvisor and amazon recommends 
 it 's still experts that we rely upon most
 especially when the stakes are high
 and the decision really matters 
 because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity  
 we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can that they are able to come to better
  conclusions than we could come to on our own  and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening
 or confusing  we feel reassured by the almost 
 authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do
  but i believe that this is a big problem a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us
 as a society as a culture
 and as individuals 
 it 's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world of course they have the problem lies with us we 've become
  addicted to experts  we 've become addicted to their certainty their assuredness their definitiveness  
 and in the process we have ceded our responsibility  substituting our intellect and our intelligence
 for their supposed words of
  we 've surrendered our power  trading off our discomfort with uncertainty
 for the illusion of certainty that they provide this
 is no exaggeration in a recent experiment a group of adults
 had their brains scanned in an mri machine as they were listening to
  the results were quite extraordinary as they listened to the experts ' voices the independent 
  parts of their brains
 switched off 
 it literally  flat lined and they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice however right or wrong
  but experts do get things wrong  did you know
  that studies show that doctors
 misdiagnose
 four times out of ten  
 did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself 
 you 're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you 
  and then there 's of course the example that we 're all too aware of financial experts getting it so wrong
 that we 're living through the worst recession since the 
 for the sake of our health our wealth
 and our collective security it 's imperative that we keep the independent
  parts of our brains
 switched on and i 'm saying this as an economist who over the past few years has focused my research on
 what it is we think and who it is we trust and why  but also
 and i 'm aware of the irony here
 as an expert myself as a professor as somebody who advises prime ministers  heads of big companies
  organizations but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change 
 that we need to become more open minded more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view 
 so in order to help you understand where i 'm coming from let me bring you into my
  world the world of experts now there are of course  exceptions  wonderful
 exceptions  but what my research has shown me is that
 experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps that within these camps a dominant
  perspective emerges that often silences opposition that experts move with the prevailing winds  often 
 their own gurus  alan greenspan 's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on
  after the crisis of course you see  
 we also learn that experts are located are governed by the social and cultural norms of their times
 whether it be the doctors in victorian england say who sent women to
  expressing sexual desire or the psychiatrists in the united states who up until one thousand nine 
 were still categorizing homosexuality
 as a mental illness and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift
  and nuance are ignored
 and also
 that money talks because we 've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies
 of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects or studies funded by food companies
 of
 of their new products massively exaggerating the health benefits
 of the products they 're about to bring by market the study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study  
 and we 've also got to be aware that experts of course  
 also make mistakes they make mistakes every single day
 mistakes born out of carelessness
  study in the archives of surgery
 reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries  operating on the wrong side of the brain 
 carrying out procedures on the wrong hand  elbow eye foot and also mistakes born out of thinking errors 
 a common thinking error of radiologists for example
 when they look at
 ct scans
 is that they 're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient 's problem to be 
 so if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia say
  what happens is that if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan they literally stop looking at it
 thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient 's lungs 
 i 've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts these
  only insights i could share but i hope they give you a clear sense at least
 of why we need to stop kowtowing to them why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision making capabilities on 
 but how can we do this well for the sake of time i want to focus on just
  got to be ready and willing to take experts on
 and dispense with this notion of them as modern day apostles
 this doesn 't mean having to get a ph d in every single subject you 'll be relieved to hear 
 but it does mean persisting in the face of their
  we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand 
 why was it that when i had an operation my doctor said to me 
 beware ms hertz of hyperpyrexia 
 when he could have just as easily said watch out for a high fever
  also being willing to dig behind their graphs their equations their forecasts their prophecies and being armed with the questions to do that
 questions like what are the assumptions that underpin this 
 what is the evidence upon which this is based what has your investigation focused on 
 and what has it ignored
 it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market
 typically trial drugs first  primarily on male animals
 and then  primarily on men it seems that they 've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world 's population are women
 and women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs
 don 't work nearly as well on women as they do on men
 and the drugs that do work well work so well that they 're actively harmful for women to take being a rebel
  is about recognizing that experts ' assumptions and their methodologies
 can easily be flawed  
 second 
 we need to create the space for what i call managed dissent if we are to shift paradigms if we are to make breakthroughs 
 if we are to destroy myths we need to create an environment in which
 expert ideas are battling it out in which
  we 're bringing in new diverse  discordant  heretical views into the discussion  fearlessly in the knowledge
 that progress comes about not only from the creation of ideas  but also from their destruction
 and also from the knowledge that by surrounding ourselves by divergent
  discordant  heretical views all the research now shows us
 that this actually makes us smarter  
 encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts 
 which are to surround ourselves with opinions
  and advice
 that we already believe or want to be true  
 and that 's why i talk about the need to actively manage dissent 
 google ceo eric schmidt is a practical
 practitioner of this philosophy in meetings he looks out for the person in the room arms crossed looking a bit bemused
 and draws them into the discussion  trying to see if
  they indeed are the person with a different opinion so that they have dissent within the room managing dissent
 is about recognizing the value
 of disagreement  discord and difference 
 but we need to go even further we need to fundamentally redefine
 who it is that experts
 are the conventional notion is that experts are people with
 advanced degrees  fancy titles diplomas  best selling books
  individuals  but just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise
  as some sort of elite cadre
 and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise
 whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo 's  but also
 yeah  best buy  the consumer electronics company  gets all its employees
 the cleaners the shop assistants the people in the back office  not just its forecasting team
 to place bets yes bets on things like whether or not
 a product is going to sell well before christmas on whether customers ' new ideas
 are going to be or should be taken on by the company on whether a project will come in on
  time by
 leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company  best buy was able to discover for example that
 the store that it was going to open in china its big grand store was not going to open on time because when it asked
  all its staff to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not a group from the finance department
 placed all their chips
 on that not happening it turned out that they were aware as no one else within the company was of a technological blip
 that neither the forecasting experts nor the experts on the ground in china were even aware of
 the strategies that i have discussed this evening
 embracing dissent  taking experts on  democratizing expertise rebellious strategies
 are strategies
 that i think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing
  complex difficult times for if we keep our independent decision making part of our brains switched on 
 if we challenge experts if we 're skeptical if we devolve authority if we are rebellious  but also
 if we become much more comfortable with nuance uncertainty
 and doubt  and if we allow our experts
 to express themselves using those terms too we will set ourselves up much better
 for the challenges of the 21st century  
 for now more than ever is not the time to be blindly following  
 blindly accepting
 blindly trusting now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open
 yes using experts to help us figure things out for sure
 i don 't want to completely do myself out of a job here
 but being
