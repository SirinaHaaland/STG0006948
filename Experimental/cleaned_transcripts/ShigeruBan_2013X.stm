  making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube and this exhibition is the first one i did using paper
  and environmental issues  
 i just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure it 's very complicated to test the
 new material for the building but this is much stronger than i expected and also it 's very easy to waterproof and also because it 's industrial
  this is the first temporary building made out of paper there are three hundred and thirty tubes
  there was a big expo in germany i was asked to design the building because the theme of the expo was environmental issues  so i was chosen to build
 the pavilion out of paper tubes recyclable paper
 my goal of the design is not when it 's completed my goal was when the building was demolished  because
  each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year  we create a lot of industrial waste so my building has to be reused or 
 after the building was recycled  so that was the goal of my design then
 i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz  
 because i was so poor  i wanted to rent an office in paris but i couldn 't afford it so i decided to bring my students to paris
  to build our office on top of the pompidou center in paris by ourselves  so we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the
  see me they had to buy a ticket to see me that was the problem 
 then i completed the pompidou center in metz it 's a very popular museum now  and i created a big monument for the government 
 but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect because we are not helping we are not working for
  they have money and power those are invisible  so they hire us to visualize their power and money
 by making monumental architecture that is our profession  even historically it 's the same  even now we are
 doing the same  so i was very disappointed that we are not working for society
  who lost their houses by natural disasters  
 but i must say they are no longer natural disasters 
 for example earthquakes never kill people  but collapse of the buildings kill people  that 's the responsibility of architects  
 then people need some temporary housing but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people  
  we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing  we can make it better  so that is why i started working in disaster 
 there was a big disaster in rwanda africa two tribes hutu and tutsi fought each other over two million people became refugees  but i was so surprised to
  just providing a plastic sheet and the refugees had to cut the trees and just like this 
 but over two million people cut trees it just became big heavy deforestation
 and an environmental problem  that
  very expensive they throw them out for money  then cutting trees again  so i proposed my idea
 to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong  but my budget is only fifty u s dollars per unit 
  we built fifty units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and
  we had a big earthquake  
 nearly seven thousand people were killed  and the city like this nagata district all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake 
 and also i found out there 's many vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a catholic church all the building was totally destroyed  
 so i went there
 and also i proposed to the priests
  why don 't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes and he said oh god are you crazy  
 after a fire what are you proposing so he never trusted me  
 but i didn 't give up i started commuting to kobe  
 and i met the society of vietnamese people they were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park  
 so i proposed to rebuild i raised did
 fundraising i made a paper tube shelter
  for them and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish  i used beer crates
 as a foundation i asked the kirin beer company to propose because at that time the
 asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red which doesn 't go with the color of the paper tubes the color coordination is very important
  i still remember we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate but it came empty so i remember it was so disappointing  
 so during the summer with my students we built over fifty units of the shelters  finally the priest finally he trusted me to rebuild he said as long as you collect money by yourself bring your students to build you can do it so we spent five weeks rebuilding the
  it was meant to stay there for three years but actually it stayed there ten years because people loved it then
 in taiwan they had a big earthquake 
 and we proposed to donate this church  so we dismantled them we sent them over to be built by volunteer people it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now  
 so this building became a permanent building 
 then i wonder what is a permanent and what is a temporary building
  even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it  even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money 
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine in turkey the big earthquake i went there to use the local material to build a
 shelter two thousand and one in west india  i built also a shelter  in two thousand and four in sri lanka after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami
  rebuilt islamic fishermen 's villages and in two thousand and eight in
 chengdu sichuan area in china
  nearly seventy thousand people were killed  and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor i was asked to rebuild the temporary church 
 i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese
 month  we completed nine classrooms over five hundred square meters it 's still used even after the current earthquake in china  
 in two thousand and nine in italy l 'aquila 
 also they had a big earthquake and this is a very interesting photo  former prime minister berlusconi
  have to change the prime minister ever year  and they are very kind affording my model i proposed a big rebuilding 
 temporary music hall because l 'aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed so musicians were moving out  so i proposed to the mayor i 'd like to
  as long as you bring your money  you can do it and i was very lucky mr berlusconi brought g8 summit and our former prime minister came  so they helped us to
 collect money and i got half a million euros from the japanese government to rebuild this temporary
 auditorium  year two thousand and ten in haiti there was a big earthquake but it 's impossible to fly
  six hours to get to haiti with the local students in santo domingo to build fifty units of shelter out of local paper tubes this is what happened in japan two years ago  in northern japan 
 after the earthquake and tsunami people had to be evacuated in a big room like a
 gymnasium  but look at this there 's no privacy people suffer mentally and physically  so we went there to build partitions
 with all the student volunteers with paper tubes just a very simple shelter
 out of the tube frame and the curtain 
 however some of the facility authority doesn 't want us to do it because they said simply it 's become more difficult to control them 
 but it 's really necessary to do it they don 't have enough flat area to
  housing like this one look at this even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing  so dense
 and so messy because there is no storage nothing  water is leaking  so i thought we have to make  multi story building because there 's no land
 and also it 's not very comfortable  so i proposed to the
  while i was making partitions finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi 
 he asked me to build three story housing 
 i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building
 furniture to make them comfortable  within the budget of the government but also the
 area of the house is exactly the same  but much more comfortable many of the
 people want to stay here forever i was very happy to hear that 
 now i am working in in new zealand  christchurch  
 about twenty days before the japanese earthquake happened also they had a big earthquake and many japanese students were also killed  
 and the most important cathedral of the city the symbol of
  was totally destroyed  and i was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral  so this is under construction  
 and i 'd like to keep building monuments
 that are beloved by people
