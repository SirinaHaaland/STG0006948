  sure whether
 i really want to see a snare drum at nine o 'clock or so in the morning laughter
 anyway it 's just great to see such a full theater  and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation
 interesting things of course is the combination of
 that raw hand on the instrument and
 technology  and what he said about listening to our young people of course my job is all about
  is to teach the world to listen  that 's my only real aim in life 
 and it sounds quite simple but actually it 's quite a big 
 big job because you know 
 when you look at a piece of music for example if i just open my little
  motorbike bag
 we have here hopefully a piece of music
 that is full of little black dots on the page and you know 
 we open it up  
 and i read the music  so
 technically i can actually read this i will follow the instructions the tempo markings the dynamics
 i will do exactly as i 'm told
 and so therefore because time is short  if i just played you literally the first maybe 
 two lines or so it
 's very straightforward there 's nothing too difficult about the piece but here i 'm being told that the piece of music is very quick 
 i 'm being told where to
  play on the drum i 'm being told which part of the stick to use  
 and i 'm being told the dynamic  
 and i 'm also being told that the drum is without snares snares on  snares off  so therefore
  if i
 translate
  and so on my career would probably last about five years however  what i have to do as a musician
 is do everything that is not on the music  everything that that there isn 't time to learn from a teacher
  to talk about  even from a teacher  but it 's the things you notice when you 're not actually with your instrument
 that in fact become so interesting  and that you you want to explore through this tiny tiny surface of a drum  
 so there we experience the translation
  the interpretation
  if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on i see that you 're clutching a teddy bear etc etc  so i get a basic idea as to
 what you might be about what you might like what you might do as a profession
  etc etc however  that 's just the initial initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look
 and we try to interpret but actually it 's so unbelievably shallow in the same way i look at the music i get a basic idea i wonder what technically might be hard or 
 you know what i want to do just the basic feeling
  enough and i think what herbie said  please listen 
 listen  we have to listen to ourselves first of all if i play for example
  holding the stick where literally i do not let go of the stick drum
 sound you 'll experience quite a lot of shock
  coming up through the arm and you feel really quite believe it or not detached from the instrument and from the stick stick  even though i 'm actually holding the stick quite tightly 
 by holding it tightly i feel strangely more detached  
 if i just simply let go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system suddenly
 much more 
 and i just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum  and i 'm doing far far less so in the same way that  i need time with
 this instrument i need time with people in order to interpret them not just translate
  but interpret them if for example  i play just a few bars of a piece of music
 for which i think of myself as a technician that is someone who is basically a percussion player
  and so on if i think of myself as a musician
  is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just thinking
 about and i remember
 when i was twelve years old and i started playing timpani and percussion  and
 my teacher
  how are we going to do this you know music
 is about
 listening 
 and i said yes i agree with that so what 's the problem 
 and he said well  how are you going to hear this how are you going to hear that and i said well how do you hear it he said 
 well i think i hear it through here and i said well i think i do too  but i also hear it
 through my hands
  tummy my chest my legs and so on and so we began our lessons every single time
 tuning drums in particular the kettle drums or timpani to such a narrow pitch interval so something like 
  it 's amazing that when you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through that in fact the tiny tiny difference 
 can be felt with just the tiniest part
  your finger there and so what we would do is that i would put my hands on the wall of the music room and together  we would listen 
 to the sounds of the instruments  and really try to connect with those sounds far far more broadly than simply depending on the ear because of course the ear is
 subject to all sorts of things the room we happen to be in the amplification the quality of the instrument
  the type of sticks
  beings but we all have our own little sound colors as it were that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things 
 and as i grew older i then auditioned for the royal academy of music in london and they said well no we won 't accept you because we haven 't a clue you know
  if you refuse if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to
 perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound
  then we have to think very very hard about the people you do actually accept 
 and as a result  once we got over over a little hurdle and having to audition twice 
 they accepted me  and not only that  what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom under no
  circumstances were they to refuse any application
 on the basis of whether someone had no arms no legs they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand 
 no circumstances at all were used to refuse
  every single entry had to be listened to experienced and then based on the musical ability then that person
 could either enter or not 
 and so therefore  this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions  and i have
  of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world the interesting thing about this as well though 
 is quite simply that
 not only were people connected with sound which is basically all of us we well know that music really is our
  some of the extraordinary things i 've experienced as a musician when you may have
 lad who
 has got the most incredible challenges who may not be able to control his movements who may be deaf who may be blind etc etc suddenly  if that
  young lad
 sits close to this instrument and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba  and you play something that 's so incredibly
 almost i don 't really have the the right sticks perhaps but something something like this let me change
  and
  i 'm on top of the sound 
 i have the sound coming this way  he would have the sound coming through the resonators  if there were no resonators on here  we would have 
 so he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn 't experience
  those of you in the back few rows wouldn 't experience either every single one of us depending on where we 're sitting will experience this sound quite quite differently 
  and of course being the participator of the sound  and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound i want to produce for example
 exactly because i 'm not even touching it but yet 
 we get the sensation of something happening in the same way that when i see a tree moves 
 then i imagine that tree making a rustling sound do you
 see what i mean whatever the eye sees then there 's
  so there 's always always that huge
 i mean just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from so all of my performances are based on entirely what i experience 
 and not by learning a piece of music  putting on someone else 's interpretation of it buying all the cds possible of that particular piece of music  and so on and so forth  because that isn 't giving me enough of something that is so raw
 and so
 basic and something that that i can fully experience the journey of so it may be that in certain halls 
 this dynamic
 may well work
  they 're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore my level of soft gentle playing may have to be
  this explosion in
 access to sound
 especially through the deaf community this has not only affected how music institutions how
  schools for the deaf
 treat sound  and not just as a means of therapy although of course  being a participator of music that definitely is the case as well
 but it 's meant that
 acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together there are so few halls in this world that
 actually
 have have very good acoustics dare i say  but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine the tiniest 
 softest softest sound to something that is so broad  so huge so incredible there 's always something it may sound good up there may not be so good 
  there it may be great there but terrible up there maybe terrible over there but not too bad there
 etc etc  so to find an actual hall
 is incredible for which you can play exactly what you imagine without it being cosmetically enhanced  so therefore  acousticians are actually
 in conversation with
 people
  this is quite interesting  i cannot give you
 any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls but it 's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom
 so many years 
  we 've been saying well how on earth can they experience music
  deafness is about or we go like that and we imagine that 's what blindness is about if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they cannot
 walk  it may be that they can walk three four five steps that to them means they can walk 
 in a year 's time it could be two extra steps  
 in another year 's time three extra steps those are hugely important aspects
 to think about  
 so when we do listen to each other it 's unbelievably important for us to really
 to really test our listening skills to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment for me
  a musician who deals with ninety nine percent of new music it 's very easy for me to say oh yes i like that piece  no i don 't like that piece and so on and
 i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time  it may be that the chemistry isn 't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music 
 but that doesn 't mean i have the right to say it 's a bad piece of music  
  one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid  so there are no rules no right no wrong this way that way  if i asked you to
 clap maybe i can do this  if i can just say please
 clap and create the sound of thunder i 'm assuming we 've all experienced
  i don 't mean just the sound i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves and please try to create that through your clapping try just please try
  thing here  though is that i asked a group of kids not so long ago
 exactly the same question  now
 great imagination thank you very much  however  not one of you got out of your seats to think right how can i clap ok 
 maybe 
 maybe i can use my jewelry to create extra sounds maybe i can use the other parts of my body to
 extra sounds not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands in the same 
  way when we listen to music we assume that  it 's all being fed through here  this is how we experience music of course  it 's not
  can we do with thunder  i remember
 my teacher
 when i first started my very first lesson i was all prepared with sticks  ready to go 
 and instead of him saying ok evelyn please  feet slightly apart arms at a more or less 90 degree angle sticks in a more or less v shape
 keep this amount of space here  etc please keep keep your back straight etc etc etc where i was just probably going to end up absolutely rigid frozen 
  and i would not be able to strike the drum because i was thinking of so many other things he said evelyn take this drum away for for seven days and i 'll see you next week 
  i no longer required the sticks i wasn 't allowed to have these sticks  
 i had to basically look at this particular drum see how it was made what these little lugs did  what the snares did turned it upside down  experimented with the shell
  it was such an unbelievable experience because where on earth
  experience that in a piece of music  where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book so we never ever dealt with actual study books  so for example one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with
 being a percussion player as opposed to a musician is basically straightforward 
  and a little faster
 and so on and so forth  what does this piece require 
 so why can 't i then do that whilst learning a piece of music  and that 's exactly what he did  
 and interestingly the older i became and when i became a full time student at a
  all of that went out of the window we had to study from study books  and constantly  the question well why why what is this relating to i need to play a 
  piece of music well this will help your control well  how why do i need to learn that i need to relate it to a piece of music  you know  i need to say something
  why am i doing that i need to have the reason and the reason has to be
 by saying something through the music 
 and by saying something through music which basically is sound  we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people but i don 't want to
  take responsibility of your emotional baggage that 's up to you when you walk through a hall  because that then determines what and how we listen to 
  certain things i may feel sorrowful or happy  or exhilarated or angry when i play certain pieces of music  but i 'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing so please the next time you
  go to a concert just
 allow your body to open up allow your body to be this resonating chamber be aware that you 're not going to experience the same thing as the performer 
 is the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound because they 're hearing the contact of the stick
  on the drum  or the mallet on the bit of wood or the bow on the string etc or
 the breath that 's creating the sound from wind and brass they 're experiencing that rawness there  but yet they 're experiencing something so unbelievably pure  which is before the sound is actually happening  
 please take note of the life of the sound
 after the actual initial strike or breath is being pulled
 just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i 'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference rather than just arriving last night
  but i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses  but
 thank you very much for having me
  you know
 the
  clue
  can
