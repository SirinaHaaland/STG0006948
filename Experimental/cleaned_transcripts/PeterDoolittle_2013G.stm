  so yesterday i was out in the street in front of this building  and
 i was walking down the sidewalk  
 and i had company several of us and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks  we 're not talking each other  we 're facing forward  we 're moving
  when the person in front of me
 slows down and
 so i 'm watching him and he slows down and finally he stops  well that wasn 't fast enough for me 
 so i put on my turn signal  and i walked around him  and as i walked i looked to see what he was doing  and he was doing this 
 he was texting  and he couldn 't text and walk at the same time  now we could approach this from a working memory
  perspective or from a multitasking perspective we 're going to do working memory today  now working memory
 is that part of our consciousness that we are
 aware of at any given time of day you 're going it right now it 's not something we can turn off  if you turn it off that 's called a coma 
 okay so right now you 're doing just fine  
 now working memory has four basic components
 it allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge it allows us to reach back into our long term memory and pull some of that in as we need it  
 mixes it  processes it
 in light of whatever our current goal is  now the current goal isn 't something like i want to be president or the best surfer in the world it 's more mundane i 'd like that cookie
  i need to figure out how to get into my hotel room  now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that our ability to take
 what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy
 our current goal
  now working memory capacity has a fairly long history  and it 's associated with a lot of positive effects people with high working memory capacity
 tend to be good storytellers  they tend to solve and do well
 standardized tests
 however important that is they 're able to have high levels of writing ability  they 're also able to reason at high levels so what we 're
 going to do here is play a little bit with some of that so i 'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks and we 're going to take your working memory out for a ride you up for
  going to give you five words  
 and i just want you to hang on to them don 't write them down just hang on to them five words  while you 're hanging on to them i 'm going to ask you to answer three questions  
 i want to see what happens with those words so here 's the words
  so good okay what i want you to do is i want you to tell me what the answer is to twenty three times eight just shout it out
  it 's a neurological test just in case you were wondering 
 all right now what i want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the english alphabet backwards
  you should have started with z 
 all right  how many people here are still pretty sure you 've got all five words
  up with about less than half right which is normal there will be a range some people can hang on to five some people can hang on to ten some will be down to two or three 
 what we know is this is really important to the way we function right 
 and it 's going to be really important here at ted because you 're going to be exposed to so many different ideas  now
 the problem that we have is that life comes at us and it comes at us very quickly and what we need to do is to take
  that amorphous
 flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that 's about the size of a pea  
 now don 't get me wrong working memory is awesome 
 working memory allows us to
 investigate our current experience as we move forward  it allows us to make sense of the world around us
  but it does have certain limits  now
 working memory is great for allowing us to communicate we can have a conversation  
 and i can build a narrative around that so i know where we 've been and where we 're going and how to contribute to this conversation it
 allows us to problem solve critical think 
 we can be in the middle of a meeting  listen to somebody 's presentation evaluate it  decide whether or not we like it ask follow up questions all of that occurs
  it also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese
 when what we 're really looking for is red bull and bacon 
 gotta make sure we 're getting what we 're looking for now 
 a central issue with working memory is that it 's limited it 's limited in capacity limited in duration limited in focus  we tend to remember about
  it used to be seven  but with functional mris apparently it 's four and we were overachieving  
 now we can remember those four things for about ten to twenty seconds unless we do something with it  
 unless we process it  unless we apply it to something unless we talk to somebody about it  
 when we think about working memory  
 we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us have you ever walked from one room
 to another and then forgotten why you 're there 
 you do know the solution to that right  you go back to that original room 
 have you ever forgotten your keys you ever forgotten your car you ever forgotten your kids have you
 ever been involved in a conversation  and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting
 so you 're nodding and you 're smiling but you 're really paying attention to this one over here  until you hear that last word go up and you realize 
 you 've been asked a question 
 and you 're really hoping the answer is no because that 's what you 're about to say  
 all of that talks about working memory what we can do and what we can 't do we need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity and that working
  memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that we negotiate that through strategies 
 so what i want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here and these will be really important because you are now in an information target rich environment for the next several days
  now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence our life
  immediately and repeatedly 
 we need to process what 's going on the moment it happens not ten minutes later not a week later
 at the moment  so we need to think about well do i agree with him
  what 's missing what would i like to know 
 do i agree with the assumptions  
 how can i apply this in my life 
 it 's a way of processing what 's going on so that we can use it later  now we also need to repeat it we need to practice  so we need to think about it here 
 in between
  we want to talk to people about it we 're going to write it down and when you get home  pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time 
 practice for some reason became a very negative thing it 's
 very positive 
 the next thing is we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively 
 oftentimes we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge what we want to do is spin that around we want to take all of our
  existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful 
 we also want to use imagery  we are built for images  we need to take advantage of that 
 think about things in images write things down that way 
 if you read a book  pull things up i just got through reading the great gatsby and i have a perfect idea of what he looks like
 in my head so my own version the last one
  is organization and support we are meaning making machines it 's what we do we try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us  
 organization helps  so we need to structure what we 're doing in ways that make sense if we are providing
 knowledge and experience we need to structure that and the last one is support 
 we all started as novices everything we do is an approximation of sophistication we should expect it to change over time we have to support
  that the support may come in asking people questions giving them a sheet of paper that has
 an organizational chart on it or has some
 guiding images  but we need to support it  now the final piece of this the take home message
 from a working memory capacity standpoint is this what we process we learn  if we 're not processing life
