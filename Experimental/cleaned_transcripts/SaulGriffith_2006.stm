  sort of conveniently encompasses everything i do  and i recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some some valley
  i sort of really was dumbstruck  and i really should have said something smart  and now i 've had a little bit of time to think about it
 i would have said well you know 
 if we look at the next one hundred years and we 've seen all these problems in the last few days  
 most of the big issues clean water clean energy and they 're interchangeable in some respects and cleaner more functional materials they all look to me to be hardware problems
  doesn 't mean we should ignore software  or information or computation and that 's in fact probably what i 'm going to
 try and tell you about  so  this talk is going to be about how do we make things and
 what what are the new ways that we 're going to make things in the future now ted
 sends you a lot of spam if you 're a speaker about do this do that and you fill out all these forms and you don 't actually know how they 're going to describe you
 it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist  and i 've always been nervous about the term futurist because you seem doomed to failure because you can 't really predict it 
 and i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues i have and said you know well if i have to talk about the future what is it 
 and george homsey a
 great guy said oh the future is amazing it is so much stranger than you think we 're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut and we 're going to
  make your poo smell like
 peppermint so you may think that that 's sort of
 really crazy but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible  so this isn 't my work but it 's work of
 good friends of mine at mit this is called the registry of standard biological parts this is headed by drew endy and tom knight and a few other very very bright individuals  basically what they 're doing is looking at biology
  as a programmable system literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program  now this is
 actually becoming such an interesting idea  this is a state diagram that 's an extremely simple computer  this one is a two bit counter so that 's essentially
 the computational equivalent of two light switches and this is being built
  by a group of students at zurich for a design competition in biology 
 and from the results of the same competition last year a university of texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on 
  and off so this is interesting in the sense that you can now do if then for statements in materials 
  's said glibly form follows function but i think i 've sort of grown up in a world 
 i was in a lab associated with his
 where it 's really a world where information defines form and function  i spent
 six years thinking about that but to show you the power of art over science this is actually one of the cartoons i write these are called howtoons i work with a fabulous illustrator called nick dragotta
 took me six years at mit and about that many pages to to describe what i was doing and it took him one page  
 and so this is our muse tucker he 's an interesting little kid and his sister celine
 and what he 's doing here is observing the self assembly of his cheerios in his cereal bowl  and in fact you can program the self assembly of things so he starts
  and the hydrophylicity in theory if you program those sufficiently  you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure in this case he 's done 
 of a complex 3d structure and that 's what i thought about for a long time  
 because this is how we currently make things  this is a silicon wafer and essentially that 's just
  nanometers now on the right that 's a radiolara that 's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans  and that
 that has feature sizes down to about twenty nanometers and it 's a complex 3d structure we could do a lot more with computers and and things generally if we knew how to build things this way 
  the secret to biology is it builds computation into the way it makes things so this little thing here polymerase is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating
 dna  and the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins i thought about this in the sense that it 's great to build in biological materials 
 but
 can we do similar things can we get 
  behavior can we
  automatically assembling in inorganic systems because there are some advantages to inorganic systems like higher speed semiconductors etc  
 so this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self replicating system
  and this is sort of babbage 's revenge these are little mechanical computers these are five state state machines so that 's about three light switches lined
  in a neutral state they won 't bind at all now if i make a string of these
 a bit string they will be able to replicate so we start with white blue blue white that encodes 
 that will now copy  from one comes two  
 and then from two comes three and so you 've got this sort of replicating system it was work actually by lionel penrose father of roger penrose the tiles guy he did a lot of this work in the
  theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution but it 's now coming back so now i 'm going to show you the hands free autonomous self replication 
 so we 've tracked in the video the input string which was green green yellow yellow green 
 we set them off on this air hockey table
  you know high science uses air hockey tables
  parts bin that you have here  so we 've got autonomous replication of
 of bit strings so why would you want to replicate
 bit strings  well  it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme that you can take a linear string which is a convenient thing to copy and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3d structure  
 so i was trying to you know  take the engineer 's version can we build a mechanical system
  in inorganic materials that will do the same thing so what i 'm showing you here is that we can make a 2d shape
 the b assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules and the the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here and the incredibly simple 
  state machines in the previous design was that you don 't need digital logic to do computation and that way you can scale things much smaller than
  microchips so you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process  so  neil gershenfeld showed you this video
 on wednesday i believe but i 'll show you again
 this is literally the colored sequence of those tiles each different color has a different magnetic polarity  and the sequence is uniquely
  the structure that is coming out now hopefully those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3d structure 
 and in fact you know  i can now take a dog carve it up and then reassemble it so it 's a linear string that will fold from a sequence and now i can actually define that three dimensional object as a sequence
  it 's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently  and the universe is now a compiler  and so i 'm thinking about you know what are the programs for programming the physical universe
  and how do we think about materials and structure  sort of as an information and computation problem not just where you attach a micro controller to the end point but that the structure
  totally absorbed this philosophy i started looking at a lot of problems a little differently  with the universe as a computer you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations you set a couple of boundary conditions 
 like gravity the surface tension  density etc 
 and then you press execute and magically the universe produces
  you a perfect ball lens  so this actually applied to the problem of so there 's
 a half a billion to a billion people in the world don 't have access to cheap eyeglasses so
 can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly
 on site  this is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition if it 's circular you make a spherical lens if it 's elliptical you can make an astigmatic
  you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure so that 's part of the extra program 
 and literally with only those two inputs so the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error from
 minus twelve to plus eight diopters up to four diopters of cylinder  and then literally you now pour on a monomer  you know i
 'll do a julia childs here this is three minutes of
 you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you 've cooked it 
 pop it out i 've seen this video but i still don 't know if it 's going to end right 
 so you reverse this this is a very old movie so with the new prototypes 
 actually both surfaces are flexible but this will show you the point now you 've finished
  and you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters and as i rotate it against this side shot you 'll see that that has cylinder and that was programmed in literally
 into the physics of the system  so this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information
  leads to other things like
 this this is something that
 my people at squid labs are working on at the moment called electronic rope so literally you think about a rope it has very complex structure in the weave and under no load it 's one structure under a different load it 's a different structure 
 and you can actually exploit that by putting in a very
 small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor so this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope just by thinking about the physics of the world materials
  as the computer you can start to
 do things like this 
 i 'm going to segue a little here  
 i guess i 'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that i think about with this one thing i 'm really interested about this right now is how
  if you 're really taking this view of the universe as a computer how do we make things in a very general
  might we share the way we make
 things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware and a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems share the information and work on those things together 
 so a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time and unless lisa randall changes that we 'll continue to move in in linear time  so that means anything you do or anything you
  sequence of steps and i think lego in the ' 70s nailed this and they did it most elegantly  but they can show you how to build things
 in sequence so 
 i 'm thinking about how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things so you end up with this sort of guy 
 right and i think this applies across a very broad
 sort of a lot of concepts you know cameron sinclair yesterday said how do i get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity
  you 've seen amy smith she talks about how you get
 students at mit to work with communities in haiti  and i think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things 
  so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other 's source code for structure i don 't know exactly how to do this yet but
 so you know that leads to questions like is this a compiler is this a sub routine 
 interesting things like that maybe i 'm getting a little too abstract but you know 
 this is the sort of returning to our comic characters this is sort of the universe or a different universe view that i think is going to be very prevalent in the future from biotech to materials assembly it was great to hear bill joy they 're starting to invest in materials science but these are the
  new things in materials science how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas and see the world in a different way and it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe it 's sort of an analog computer  but it 's definitely an interesting new
 worldview  
 i 've gone too far  so that sounds like it 's it i 've probably got a couple of minutes of questions or i can show i think they also said that i do extreme
 in the introduction so i may have to explain that 
 so maybe i 'll do that with this this short video  so this is actually
  a 3 000 square foot kite which also happens to be a minimal energy surface so returning to the droplet again thinking about the universe in a new way  this is
  kite designed by a guy called dave kulp  and why do you want a 
  kite so that 's a kite the size of your house  and so you want that to tow boats very fast
 so i 've been working on this a little also with a couple of other guys  but you know this is another way to look at the
 if you abstract again
  this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe you could just hang it as a bed sheet but again the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape  and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that
  so that that 's sort of another interesting aspect of the
