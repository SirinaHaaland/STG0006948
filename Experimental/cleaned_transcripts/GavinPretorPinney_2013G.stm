  how much people moan about them
 they get a bad rap
 if you think about it the english language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds someone who 's down or depressed
 they 're under a cloud
 and when there 's bad news in store there 's a cloud on the horizon i saw an article the other day
 it was about problems with computer processing over the internet
 a cloud over the cloud was the headline
 it seems like they 're everyone 's default doom and gloom metaphor but i think they 're beautiful don 't you it 's just that their
  beauty is missed because they 're so omnipresent so
 i don 't know commonplace that people don 't notice them they don 't notice the beauty but they don 't even notice the clouds unless they get in the way of the sun
 and so people think of clouds as things that get in the way
 they think of them as the annoying frustrating obstructions and then they rush off and do some blue
  sky thinking
 laughter but most people when you stop to ask them will
 admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds it 's like a nostalgic fondness and they make them think of their youth
 who here can 't remember thinking well looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids you know when
 you were masters of daydreaming
 aristophanes the ancient greek playwright he described the clouds as the patron godesses of idle fellows
 two and a half thousand years ago and you can see what he means it 's just that these days us adults seem reluctant to
 allow ourselves the indulgence of just
 allowing our imaginations to to drift along in the breeze and i think that 's a pity i think we should perhaps do a bit more of it i think we should be
 a bit more willing perhaps to
 look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds and go wait a minute that 's two cats dancing the
  white puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank laughter
 they 're like nature 's version of those inkblot images you know that shrinks used to show their patients in the sixty s
 and i think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds you 'll save money on psychoanalysis
 bills
 let 's say you 're in love all right and you look up and what do you see
 right or maybe the opposite you 've just been dumped by your partner and and everywhere you look it 's kissing couples laughter
 perhaps you 're having a moment of existential angst you know you 're thinking about your own mortality and and there on the horizon it 's the grim reaper
 or maybe you see a topless sunbather laughter
 what would that mean
 what would that mean i have no idea
 but one thing i do know is this the bad press that clouds get is totally unfair i think we should stand up for them which is why a few years ago i
  started the cloud appreciation society tens of thousands of members now
 in almost one hundred countries around the world and all these photographs that i 'm showing they were sent in by members
 and the society exists to remind people of this clouds are not something to moan about
 far from it they are in fact the most diverse evocative
  poetic aspect of nature
 i think if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then it helps you keep your feet on the ground
 and i want to show you why with the help of some of my favorite types of clouds let 's start with this one it 's the cirrus cloud named after the latin for a lock of hair
 it 's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere and as these ice
  crystals fall they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down giving the cloud these brush stroked appearances these brush stroke forms known as fall 
  streaks and these winds up there can be very very fierce they can be two hundred miles an hour three hundred miles an hour these clouds are bombing along but from all the way down here they appear to be moving gracefully
  the clouds is to slow down to calm down
 it 's like a bit of everyday meditation
 those are common clouds what about rarer ones like the lenticularis the ufo shaped lenticularis cloud these clouds form in the region of mountains
 when the wind passes rises to pass over the mountain it can take on a wave like path in the lee of the peak with these clouds hovering at the crest of
  these invisible standing waves of air
 these flying saucer like forms and some of the early black and white ufo photos are in fact lenticularis clouds it 's true a
 little rarer are the fallstreak holes all right this is when a layer is made up of very very cold water droplets and in one region they start to freeze and this freezing 
  sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards with the ice crystals cascading and falling down
  below giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below
 rarer still the kelvin helmholtz cloud not a very snappy name
 needs a rebrand this looks like
 a series of breaking waves and it 's caused by shearing winds the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly and in the middle in between you get this undulating
  of the air and if the difference in those speeds is just right the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave like vortices
 all right those are rarer clouds than the cirrus but they 're not that rare
 if you look up
 and you pay attention to the sky you 'll see them sooner or later
 maybe not quite as dramatic as these but you 'll see them and you 'll see them around where you live clouds are the most egalitarian of
  nature 's displays because we all have a good fantastic view of the sky
 and these clouds these rarer clouds remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday
 nothing is more nourishing more stimulating to an active inquiring mind than being surprised being amazed it 's why we 're all here at ted right
 but you don 't need to rush off away
  from the familiar across the world to be surprised you just need to step outside
 pay attention to what 's so commonplace so everyday so mundane
 that everybody else misses it
 one cloud that people rarely miss is this one the cumulonimbus storm cloud it 's
 what 's produces thunder and lightning and hail these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching
  ten miles up into the atmosphere they are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere but from down below
 they are the embodiment of
 the powerful elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere to be there is to be connected
 in the driving rain and the hail to feel connected to our atmosphere it 's to be reminded
  that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air we don 't live beneath the sky we live within it
 and that connection that visceral connection to our atmosphere
 feels to me like an antidote it 's an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life
 by watching it on a computer screen you know when we 're in a wi fi zone
 but the one cloud
  that best expresses why cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever is this one the cumulus cloud right it forms on a sunny day
 if you close your eyes and think of a cloud it 's probably one of these that comes to mind all those cloud shapes at the beginning those were cumulus clouds
 the
 sharp crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in
 and it reminds us
 of the aimless nature of cloudspotting what an aimless activity it is you 're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky are you it
 's pointless it 's a pointless activity which is precisely why it 's so important
  the digital world conspires to make us feel eternally busy perpetually busy you know when you 're not dealing with the traditional pressures of
 earning a living and putting food on the table raising a family writing thank you letters
 you have to now contend with
 answering a mountain of unanswered emails updating a facebook page feeding your twitter feed
 and cloudspotting
  legitimizes doing nothing laughter
 and sometimes we need applause
 sometimes we need excuses to do nothing
 we need to be reminded by these patron goddesses of idle fellows
 that slowing down
 and being in the present not thinking about what you 've got to do and what you should have done
 but just being here letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present it 's good for you and
 it 's good for the way you feel
 it 's good for your ideas it 's good for your creativity it 's good for your soul
  so keep looking up marvel at the ephemeral beauty and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds thank you very much
