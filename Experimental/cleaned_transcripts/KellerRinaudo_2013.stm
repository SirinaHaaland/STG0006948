  just by a show of hands how many of you all have a robot at home 
 not very many of you okay and actually of those hands  if you don 't include roomba how many of you have a robot at home
 so a couple that 's okay that 's the problem that we 're trying to solve at romotive that i and
  the other twenty nerds at romotive are obsessed with solving  so we really want to build a robot that anyone can use whether you 're eight or eighty  
 and as it turns out that 's a really hard problem because you have to build a small portable robot that 's not only really affordable  
 but it has to be something that people actually want to take home
 and have around their kids this robot can 't be creepy or uncanny
  he should be friendly and cute  so meet romo 
 romo 's a robot that uses a device you already know and love your iphone as his brain  
 and by leveraging the power of the iphone 's processor 
 we can create a robot
 that is wi fi
  for one hundred and fifty bucks  which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past
  when romo wakes up  he 's in creature mode  
 so he 's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face if i duck down he 'll follow me he 's wary so he 'll keep his eyes on me  
 if i come over here he 'll turn to follow me
  if i get too close to him
  he gets scared just like any other creature so in a lot of ways romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own  thanks little guy sneezing
 bless you  and 
 if i want to explore the world uh oh romo 's tired if i want to explore the world with romo i can actually connect him from any other ios device so here 's the
  ipad  
 and romo will actually stream video to this device so i can see everything that romo sees and i get a robot 's eye view of the world now this is a free app on the app store so if any of you guys had this app on your phones we 
  could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together so i 'll show you really quickly romo actually he 's streaming video so you can see me and the entire ted audience if i get in front of romo here
  so i can drive him around  
 and i can take pictures of you i 've always wanted a picture of a 1 500 person ted audience so i 'll snap a picture and in the same way that you scroll through content on an 
  ipad  i can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device so there are all of you through romo 's eyes
  and finally because romo is an extension of me i can express myself through his emotions so i can go in and i can say let 's make romo excited
  but the most important thing about romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally
 completely intuitive you do not have to teach someone how to drive romo in fact  who would like to drive a robot
  even cooler you actually don 't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to
 to control him so he actually streams two way audio and video between any two smart devices so you can log in through the browser and it 's kind of like skype on wheels so we were talking before about telepresence and this is a really cool example you can imagine an
  who has an iphone and her mom buys her a robot that girl can take her iphone  put it on the robot send an email to grandma who lives on the other side of the country 
 grandma can log into that robot and play hide and go seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night  when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year  thanks scott 
 so those are a couple of the really cool things that romo can do today but i
  want to finish by talking about something that we 're working on in the future 
 this is actually something that one of our engineers dom built in a weekend it 's built on top of a google open framework called blockly this allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic 
 code and create any behavior for this robot you want you do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for romo and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser which is what you see romo doing on the left  and then if
  have something you like you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life  run the program in real life  and then if you have something you 're proud of you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world so all of these  wi fienabled robots actually learn from each other 
 the reason we 're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal they change from person to person
 so we think that if you 're going to have a robot in your home that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination  
 so i wish that i could tell you what the the future of personal robotics looks like to be honest i have no idea
  but what we do know is that it isn 't ten years or ten billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away the future of personal robotics is happening today  and it
  going to depend on small agile robots like romo and the creativity of people like yourselves  so we can 't wait to get you all robots and we can 't wait to see what you build  thank you
