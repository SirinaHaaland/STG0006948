  the humanitarian model has barely changed since the early 20th century  its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age  and
 there is a major shift coming on the horizon  the catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck haiti
 on the 12th of january in two thousand and ten haiti was a game changer the earthquake destroyed the capital 
 claiming the lives of some three hundred and twenty thousand people rendering homeless about one point two million people 
 government institutions were completely decapitated  including the presidential palace
 i remember standing on the roof of the ministry of justice in downtown 
 was about two meters high  completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake 
 for those of us on the ground in those early days  it was clear for even the most 
 veterans that haiti was something different haiti was something we hadn 't seen before  but haiti provided
  us with something else unprecedented  
 haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices  
 because out of the urban devastation
 came a torrent of sms texts people crying for help
 us for assistance sharing data  offering support looking for their loved ones 
 this was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered  
 we were in one of the poorest countries on the planet  but eighty percent of the people
 had mobile devices in their hands  and we were unprepared for this and they were shaping the aid effort  outside haiti also
 things were looking different  
 tens of thousands of so called digital volunteers were scouring the internet  converting tweets that had already been converted from texts and putting these into open source maps 
 layering them with all sorts of important information people like crisis mappers and open street map and putting these on the web for everybody the media the aid organizations and the communities themselves
 to participate in
  and to use  back in haiti people were increasingly
 turning to the medium of sms people that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress were signaling their need for help 
 on street sides all over port au prince entrepreneurs sprung up
 offering
  mobile phone charging stations they understood more than we did people 's innate need to be connected  
 never having been confronted with this type of situation before
  we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology
 and sms technology we started talking with a
  which is a subsidiary of trilogy international  
 we had basically three requirements  we wanted to communicate in a two way form of communication we didn 't want to shout we needed to listen as well  
 we wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities we didn 't need to talk to the whole country at the same time  and we wanted it to be easy to use 
 out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera
  tera the trilogy emergency response application
 which has been used to support the aid effort ever since 
 it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters it has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather related disasters it
 's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera
  even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender based violence  but does it work 
 we have just published an evaluation of this program  
 and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable  
 some seventy four percent of people received the
  were intended to receive the data seventy four percent of them received it ninety six percent of them found it useful
 eighty three percent of them took action evidence that it is indeed empowering and seventy three percent of them shared it 
 the tera system
 was developed from haiti with support of engineers in the region it is a 
  technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect
  technology is transformational right across the developing world  citizens and communities
 are using technology to enable them to bring about change positive change in their own communities  
 the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models  the old analog models of control and command 
 one illustration of the
  transformational power of technology
 is in kibera kibera is one of africa 's largest slums it 's on the outskirts of nairobi the capital city of kenya it
 's home to an unknown number of people some say between two hundred and fifty thousand and one point two million 
 if you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map  kibera is represented as a lush  green national park devoid of human settlement
 young people living in kibera in their community with simple handheld devices  gps handheld devices and
 mobile phones have literally put themselves on the map they have collated crowd sourced data
 and rendered the invisible visible 
 people like josh and steve are continuing to layer information upon information real time information tweet it
  and text it onto these maps for all to use 
 you can find out about the latest impromptu music session  you can find out about the latest security incident you can find out about places of worship you can find out about the health centers you can feel the dynamism of this living breathing community 
 they also have their own news network on youtube with
  thousand viewers at the moment 
 they 're showing us what can be done with mobile digital technologies they 're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible  
 and they are giving a voice to themselves they are telling their own story  bypassing the official narrative  
 and we 're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories in mongolia for instance where thirty percent of the people are
  sms information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns 
 sms is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation 
 and if people are migrating into urban  unfamiliar concrete environments they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on sms knowledge 
 in nigeria
  are being used by the red cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria  
 my colleague jason peat who runs this program tells me it 's ten times faster and ten times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things 
 and not only is it empowering to the communities but really importantly this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate
 we are on a planet of seven billion people 
 five billion mobile subscriptions 
 by two thousand and fifteen there will be three billion smartphones in the world 
 the u n broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in fifty percent of the developing world
  compared to twenty percent today  we are hurtling towards a 
 world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to smart  fast mobile devices 
 people are understanding from cairo to oakland 
 that there are new ways to come together there are new ways to
  there are new ways to influence 
 a transformation is coming
 which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models  
 the collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing  
 we need to for example embrace the big data  the knowledge that is there
 from market leaders who understand what it means to
  use and leverage big data  
 one idea that i 'd like you to consider for instance is to take a look at our it departments 
 they 're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers but they need to be elevated to software strategists  
 we need people in our organizations who know what it 's like to work with big data  we need technology
  as a core organizational principle  
 we need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question 
 what would amazon or google do with all of this data and convert it to humanitarian good 
 the possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing
 can help humanitarian organizations not only ensure that people 's right to information is met or that they have their right to communicate  
 but i think in the future
 humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies
 in order to ensure that their voices are heard that they 're truly participating that they 're truly empowered in the humanitarian world 
 it has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort
 we now have the tools we now have the possibilities there are no more reasons not to do it 
 i believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital 
 thank you very much
