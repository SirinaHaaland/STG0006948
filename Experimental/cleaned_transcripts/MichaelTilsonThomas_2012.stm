  well when i was asked to do this tedtalk i was really chuckled because you see my father 's name was ted 
 and much of my life especially my musical life is really a talk that i 'm still having with him or the part of me that he continues to be
 ted was a new yorker an all around theater guy and he was a self taught illustrator
 and musician he didn 't read a note  
 and he was profoundly hearing impaired  yet he was my greatest teacher 
 because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids his understanding of music was profound and for him it wasn 't so much
  music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you 
 and he did a painting of this experience which he called in the realm of music 
 now
 ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of tin pan alley style
  but he was tough when it came to music he said there are only two things that matter in music  what and 
 the thing about classical music that what and how it 's inexhaustible 
 that was his passion for the music both my parents really loved it they didn 't know all that much about it but
  they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them  and i think inspired
 by that memory  it 's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can sort of pass it on through whatever means 
 and how people get this music how it comes into their lives  really fascinates me one day in new york i was on the street and i saw some kids playing
  baseball between stoops and
 cars and fire hydrants  and a tough slouchy kid got up to bat  and he took a swing and really connected and he watched the ball fly for a second and then he went
  austrian aristocratic entertainment
 turn into the victory crow of this new york kid how was that passed on how did he get to hear mozart  
 well when it comes to classical music there 's an awful lot to pass on much more than mozart beethoven or tchiakovsky because
 classical music
 is an unbroken living tradition that goes
  back over one thousand years 
 and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it 's like to be alive now
 the raw material of it of course is just the music of everyday life it 's all the
 anthems and dance crazes and ballads and
  what classical music does is to
 distill all of these musics down to condense them to their absolute essence and from that essence create a new language 
 a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are it 's a language that 's still evolving
  now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of like concertos and symphonies but
 even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission
 to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment like this one from the beethoven violin concerto
  so many emotions
  to be inside of it yet of course like all music it 's essentially not about anything  it 's just a design of pitches and silence and time and
 the pitches the notes as you know are just
 vibrations they 're locations in the spectrum of sound and whether we call them
 four hundred and forty per second a or
 three thousand seven hundred and
  b flat trust me that 's right
 they 're just phenomena  but the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena
 is complex and emotional and not totally understood  
 and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries as have our preferences for them so for example 
 in the  11th century  people
  was more like this
  century ears are quite happy with this last chord even though
 a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room  and the reason you like it is because you 've inherited  whether you knew it or not
  of changes
 in musical theory  practice and fashion and in classical music we can follow these changes very very accurately because
 of the music 's powerful silent partner the way it 's been passed on notation  
 now the impulse to notate or more exactly i should say encode music
 has been with us for a very long time in two hundred b c a man named
  sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the greeks
  a thousand years later this impulse to notate took an entirely different form and you can see how this happened in these excerpts
  little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune
 and in the  12th century a line was drawn like a musical horizon line to better
  more lines and new shapes of notes locked in
 the concept of the tune exactly and that led to the kind of notation we have today 
 well notation not only passed the music on  notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely because it enabled the musicians to
 imagine music on a much
  vaster scale now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded  saved considered  prioritized made into intricate designs  
 and from this moment classical music became what it most essentially is a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature  
 instinct and intelligence
 and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation
 and the art of composition now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move but a composer is considering
 all possible moves  testing them out prioritizing them out until he sees
 how they can
  powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness  
 now some of the greatest composers like bach were combinations of these two things bach was like a
 great improviser with a mind of a chess master mozart was the same way 
 but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason instinct and intelligence  and every
 musical era had different priorities of these things different things
  to pass on different ' whats ' and ' hows ' so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition
 the big ' what ' was to praise god  and by the 
 music was being written that tried to mirror god 's mind as could be seen in the design of the night
  was a style called polyphony music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in ptolemy 's geocentric universe 
 this was truly the music of
  the kind of music that
  would have known and perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity
 meant that something new had to happen a radical new move which in one thousand six hundred is what did happen
  its development put music on a radical new course  the what now was not to mirror the mind of god but to follow the emotion turbulence of man 
 and the how was harmony
  up the pitches to form chords  and the chords it turned out were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions  and
 the basic chords were the ones we still have with us the triads either the
 major one  which we think is
 happy or the
  minor one
  which we perceive as sad 
 but what 's the actual difference between these two chords it 's just these two notes in the middle
  it 's either e natural and
 six hundred and fifty nine vibrations per second  or e flat
  the big difference between human happiness and sadness
  freakin ' vibrations  
 so you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions  
 and in fact as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature harmony grew more complex to reflect it 
 turns out it was capable of
  expressing
 emotions beyond the ability of words  
 now with all this possibility
 classical music really took off it 's the time in which the big forms began to arise and the
 effects of technology began to be felt also  because
  the scores the codebooks of music into the hands of performers everywhere 
 and new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible 
 this is when those big forms arose the symphonies the sonatas the concertos and in these
 big architectures of time composers like beethoven could
 share the insights of a lifetime a piece like beethoven 's fifth
 basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger  
 over the course of a half an hour step by exacting step
 of his route to the moment when he could make it
  and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues like
  gripping ones of culture such as nationalism or
 quest for freedom or the frontiers of
 sensuality  but whatever direction the music took one thing until recently was always the same and that was
 when the musicians stopped playing the music stopped 
  this moment so fascinates me i find it such a profound one what happens when the music stops  where does it go 
 what 's left  what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude and how might 
  that change their lives to me this is the intimate personal side of music  it 's the
  part of it and to me that 's the most essential of all mostly it 's been a person to person thing a 
  thing and then around one thousand eight hundred and eighty came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally
 created a new and miraculous way of passing things on  albeit an impersonal
  could now hear music all the time even though it wasn 't necessary for them to play an instrument read music or even go to concerts  and technology
 democratized music by making everything available 
 it spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like caruso and bessie smith were on the same footing  
 and technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes  using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity
  beyond the means of performers and audiences at the same time technology by taking over the role that notation had always played 
 shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side the culture in which we live now
  god knows  distributed and sold what 's the long term effect of this on us or on music  nobody knows  
 the question remains what happens when the music stops what sticks with people 
 now that we have unlimited access to music  what does stick with us well let me show you a story of what i mean by really sticking
  i was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home  
 and i spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker he came over to a piano that was there  
 and he balanced himself and began playing something like this 
 music and he said something like
  how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed across the room
 to recover the memory of this music that after everything else in his life is sloughing away still means so much to him  
 well that 's why i take every performance so seriously why it matters to me so much 
 i never know who might be there who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life  
 but now i 'm excited that there 's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this
  music that 's what drives my interest in projects like the tv series keeping score with the san francisco symphony that looks at the backstories of music and working with the young musicians 
 at the new world symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education and of course the new
  youtube symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world 
 and the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype there 's just a role here for so many people teachers parents performers
 to be explorers together 
 sure the big events attract a lot of attention but what really matters is what goes on every single day we need your perspectives
  curiosity your voices and it excites me now to meet
 people who are hikers chefs code writers  taxi drivers people i never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on 
 you don 't need to worry about knowing anything
 if you 're curious if you have a capacity for wonder  if you 're alive you know all that you need to know you can start anywhere ramble a bit follow
  traces get lost be surprised amused inspired 
 all that ' what ' all that ' how ' is out there waiting for you to discover its ' why ' 
 to dive in and pass it on  thank you
