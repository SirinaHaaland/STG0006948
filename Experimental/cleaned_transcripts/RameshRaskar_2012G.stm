  and curiosity with this photo of a bullet
 piercing through an apple and exposure just a millionth of a second  
  now  fifty years later we can go a million times faster
 and see the world
 not at a million
 or a billion but one trillion frames per second  i present to you
 a new type of photography 
  a new imaging technique so fast
 that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion  
 and with that we can create cameras that can look around corners  beyond line of sight  or see inside our body
 without an x ray and really challenge what we mean by a camera now if i take a laser pointer
 and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second which is several femtoseconds
 i 'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide 
 and that packet of photons that bullet will travel at the speed of light  and again a million times faster than an ordinary
  if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire
 into this bottle  how will those photons shatter into this bottle  how does light look in slow motion
  now remember the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond that 's how much time it takes for light to travel but i 'm slowing
  down
 in this video by a factor of ten billion  so you can see the light in motion 
 but coca cola did not sponsor this research 
 now there 's a lot going on in this movie so let me break this down and show you what 's going on so the pulse enters the bottle our bullet with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside some of the light leaks
  leaks goes on the table and you start seeing these ripples of waves  
 many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions  as you can see there 's a bubble of air and it 's bouncing around inside meanwhile 
  the ripples are traveling on the table and because of the reflections at the top you see at the back of the bottle  
  now if you take an ordinary bullet
 and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of ten billion do you know how long you 'll have to sit here
 to watch that movie 
 a day a week actually a whole year  it 'll be a very boring movie
  slow ordinary bullet in motion  and what about some
 photography 
 you can watch the ripples again  washing over the table
  the tomato and the wall in the back it 's like throwing a stone in a pond of water 
 i thought this is how nature
 paints a photo one femto frame at a time  but of course our eye sees an integral composite  
 but if you look at this tomato one more time you will notice as the light washes over the tomato  it continues to glow it doesn 't become dark why is that
 because the tomato is actually ripe and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato and it comes out after several trillionths of a second  
 so in the future  
 when this femto camera is in your camera phone you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it 
 so how did my team at mit create this camera
 now as photographers you know if you take a short exposure photo you get very little light  
 but we 're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure so you
 're going to get hardly any light  
 so what we do is we send that bullet that packet of photons millions of times and record again and again with very clever synchronization and from the gigabytes of data  we computationally weave together to create
 femto videos i showed you 
 and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways 
 so superman can fly some other heroes can become invisible 
 but what about a new power for a future superhero to see around corners  
 the idea is that we could shine some light on the door it 's going to
  bounce go inside the room some of that is going to reflect back on the door  and then back to the camera  and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light  
 and it 's not science fiction we have actually built it on the left you see our femto camera 
 there 's a mannequin hidden behind a wall  and we 're going to bounce light off the door  
  going to fire those bullets of light  and they 're going to hit this wall  
 and because of the packet of the photons  they will scatter in all the
  some of them will reach our hidden mannequin which in turn will again scatter that light
  and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light  
 and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera  but most interestingly they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot 
 and because we have a camera that can run so fast our
  some unique abilities  it has very good time resolution  and it can look at the world at the speed of light  
 and this way we know the distances 
 of course to the door but also to the hidden objects  but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance 
 by shining one laser we can record one raw photo  which if you look on the screen
 't really make any sense 
 but then we will take a lot of such pictures  dozens of such pictures  put them together and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light  and from that 
 can we see the hidden object can we see it in full 3d 
 so this is our reconstruction
  we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road  but in the future we could create cars that avoid collisions with what 's around the bend  
 or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows  or we can build endoscopes
 that can see deep inside the body around occluders  
 and also for cardioscopes  but of course because of tissue and blood this is quite challenging  so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about  femto photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of
  all the gigabytes of data that we 're collecting every time are not just for scientific imaging  
 but we can also do a new form of computational photography  
 with time lapse and color coding  
 and we look at those ripples remember  the time between each of
  ripples is only a few trillionths of a second  
 but there 's also something funny going on here  when you look at the ripples under the cap the ripples are moving away from us  
 the ripples should be moving towards us what 's going on here  it turns out because we 're recording
 nearly at the speed of light  
 we have strange effects
  effects and einstein would have loved to see this picture 
 the order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order 
 so by applying the corresponding space and time warp we can correct for this distortion  
 so whether it 's for photography around corners
  or creating the next generation of health imaging  or creating new visualizations  
 since our invention  we have open sourced all the data and details on our website and our hope
 is that the diy the creative
 and the research communities
 will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels
 in cameras and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging  it 's about time  thank you
