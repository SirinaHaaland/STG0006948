  in bauer bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us one of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear
 in the last couple of days is this need
 to reconcile
 what the big
  wants the big being the organization the system the country
 and what the small wants the individual the person and how do you bring those two things together charlie ledbetter yesterday  
 i thought talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things
  and that 's what i want to talk about today  so  bringing together the small
 to help facilitate and create the big i think is something that we believe in something i believe in and something that we kind of bring to life
 through what we do at ideo  i call this first chapter for the brits in the room the blinding glimpse of the bleeding obvious often the good ideas are so
 that you kind of miss them and i think a lot of times what we do is just sort of hold the mirror up to our clients and sort of
  go duh you know 
 look what 's really going on 
 and rather than talk about it in the theory i think i 'm just going to show you an example we were asked by a large healthcare system in minnesota
 to describe to them what their patient experience was and i think they were expecting they 'd worked with lots of consultants before i think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this that and
  other and all kinds of mappy stuff or even worse some kind of ghastly 
 thing with wowcharts and all kinds of you know  god knows whatever  the first thing we actually shared with them was was this i
 'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve 
  we showed them the whole cut and they were all completely what is this and the point is
  is
 when you lie in a hospital bed
 all day 
 all you do is look at the roof and it 's a really shitty experience 
 and just putting yourself in the position of the patient this is christian who works with us at ideo 
 he just lay in the hospital bed and kind of stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time 
 that 's what it 's like to be a patient in the hospital
  and they were sort  you know blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious oh my goodness  so  looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out
 as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in
 was for these guys quite a revelation  and so that was a really catalytic thing
  so they snapped into action they said ok  it 's not about systemic change it 's not about huge ridiculous things that we need to do it 's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference  
 so we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact  the first thing we did
 was we took a little bicycle mirror
 and we band aided it here onto a gurney a hospital trolley  so that when you were
 wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor you could actually have a conversation with them you could kind of see them in your rear view mirror so it created a tiny human interaction 
 very small example of something that they could do interestingly
 the nurses themselves  sort of snapped into action said ok  we embrace this what can we do 
 the first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling 
 which i thought was really i showed this to my mother recently i think my mother now thinks that i 'm some sort of interior decorator it 's what i do for a living  sort of laurence
  world 's best design solution for those of us who are real sort of hard core designers but nonetheless a fabulous empathic solution for
 people things that they started doing themselves like changing the floor
 going into the patient 's room so that it signified this is my room this is my personal space was a really interesting sort of
 design solution to the problem so you went from public space to private space and another idea again that came from one of the nurses which i love
 was they took traditional sort of corporate white boards  then they put them on one wall of the patient 's room and they put this sticker there 
 so that what you could actually do was go into the room
 and write messages to the person who was sick in that room which was lovely so tiny tiny tiny solutions that made a huge amount of
  i thought that was a really really nice
 example 
 so this is not particularly a new idea kind of  seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution it 's a history
 of invention based around this i 'm going to read this because i want to get these names right joan ganz cooney saw her daughter came down on a saturday morning saw her daughter watching the test card waiting for programs to come on one morning
 and from that came sesame street
  malcolm mclean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship
 and he invented the shipping container george de mestral this is not bugs all over a birkenstock
 was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs
  sort of little prickly things and from that
 came velcro  
 and finally for the brits percy shaw this is a big british invention saw the cat 's eyes at the side of the road when he was driving home one night
 and from that came
 the catseye  so there 's a whole series of just using your eyes seeing things for the first time seeing things afresh
 and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities  second one without sounding overly zen
  is a quote from the buddha finding yourself in the margins looking to the edges of things is often a really interesting place to start 
 blinkered vision tends to produce i think blinkered solutions so looking wide using your peripheral vision
 is a really interesting place to look for opportunity again another medical example
  we were asked by a device producer
 we did the palm pilot and the treo we did a lot of sexy tech at ideo they 'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics this was a device that a nurse 
  uses when they 're doing a spinal procedure in hospital they 'll ask the nurses to input data  and they had this vision of the nurse kind of clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly 
 this procedure taking place and i 'll explain this in a second it became very obvious that there was a human
 dimension to this that they really weren 't recognizing when you 're having a four inch needle
 inserted into your spine which was the procedure that this device 's data was about it was for pain management you 're shit
  you 're freaking out and so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did was hold the patient 's hand
 to comfort them human gesture
 which made the fabulous two handed data input completely impossible so 
 the thing that we designed much less sexy but much more human and practical 
 was this  
 so it 's not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination but it has a thumb scroll so you can do everything with one hand
 so again going back to this the idea that a tiny human gesture
 dictated the design of this product  and i think that 's really really important 
 so again this idea of workarounds we use this phrase workarounds a lot sort of looking around us i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of
  happen while i 've been here  
 this idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential
 is something that we look at a lot  we wrote a book recently 
  i think you might have received it called thoughtless acts it 's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do which have huge intention and huge opportunity  
 why do we all
 follow the line in the street
  a picture in a japanese subway people consciously follow things even though  why  we don 't know 
 why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence 
 because we kind of have to we 're just compelled to we don 't know why  but we do  
 why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle again we 're sort of using
  the world around us to create our own design solutions 
 and we 're always saying to our clients you should look at this stuff this stuff is really important this stuff is really vital this is people designing their own experiences you can draw from this  
 we sort of assume that because there 's a pole in the street that it 's okay to use it  
 so we park our shopping cart there it 's there for our use on some
 some level so again we sort of co opt our environment to do all these different things we co opt other experiences we take
  one item and transfer it to another 
 and this is my favorite one my mother used to say to me just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn 't mean you have to 
 but of course we all do we all follow each other every day so somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something that 's permission for them to do the same thing 
 and there 's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time i mean shopping bag equals parking meter out of order and we all kind of know how to read these signals now we all talk to
  one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we 're doing third section is this idea
 of not knowing of consciously putting yourself backwards i talk about unthinking situations all the time 
 sort of having beginner 's mind scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh a friend of mine was a designer
  and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children 
 this is the billy bookcase it 's ikea 's biggest selling product  hammer it together hammer it together with a shoe if you 're me because they 're impossible to assemble  but big selling
 bookcase how do we replicate this for children the reality is when you actually watch children children don 't think about things like storage in linear
  children assume permission in a very different way children live on things they live under things they live around things  
 and so their spatial awareness relationship and their thinking around storage is totally different so the first thing you have to do
 this is graham the designer is sort of put yourself in their shoes and so  here he is sitting under the table  so what came out of this 
 this is the storage system that he designed  so what is this i hear you all ask no i don 't
 it 's this and i think this is a particularly lovely solution  
 so you know it 's a totally different way of looking at the situation it 's a completely empathic solution
 apart from the fact that teddy 's probably not loving it 
 but a really nice way of 
  and i think that 's one of the things and putting yourself in the position of the person and i think that 's one of the threads that i 've heard again from
 this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples ' shoes and really feel what they feel and then use that information to fuel solutions and i think that
 that 's what this is very much about last section green armband we 've all got them it 's about this
  it 's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win again that 's one of the themes that i think has come through loud and clear
 in this conference is where do we start  how do we start what do we do to start  so again  we were asked to design a water pump
 for a company called approtec in kenya they 're now called kickstart 
 and again as designers we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form and that was completely irrelevant when you put yourself
  position of
 these people things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle  
 become much more relevant than the form of it the way it 's produced it has to be produced with indigenous
 manufacturing methods and indigenous materials 
 so it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user we had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world so
 what seems like a very
  clunky product is in fact incredibly useful it 's powered a bit like a stairmaster you pump up and down on it
  children can use it adults can use it everybody uses it it 's turning these guys again one of the themes it 's turning them
 into entrepreneurs these guys are using this
 very successfully and for us it 's been great because it 's won loads of design awards so we actually managed
  to reconcile
 the needs of the design company the needs of the individuals in the company to feel good about a product we were actually designing 
 and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for 
 there it is pumping water from thirty feet  so
 as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning we 've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kick start no pun
  their next project 
 because again i think sort of putting our money where our mouth is here
  we feel that this is an important gesture so we 've handed out bracelets small is the new big i hope you 'll all wear them  so that 's it
