  years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off
 and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they 're supposed to hate  we have them work in government
  program is called code for america  and it 's a little bit like a peace corps for geeks  we select a few fellows every year and
 we have them work with city governments  
 instead of sending them off into the third world we send them into the wilds of city hall  and there they make great apps they work with city staffers but really what they 're doing is they 're showing what 's possible with technology today  
 so meet al
  is a fire hydrant in the city of boston 
 here it kind of looks like he 's looking for a date  but what he 's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in because he knows he 's not very good at fighting fires when he 's covered
 in four feet of snow  now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner  
 we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program they were there in february and it snowed a lot in february last year
  and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants 
 but one fellow in particular a guy named erik  michaels ober noticed something else  and that 's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things  
 so he did what any good developer would do he wrote an app it
 's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant  so you agree to dig it out when it snows if you do you get to name it and he called the first one al
  and if you don 't someone can steal it from you so it 's got cute little game dynamics on it 
 this is a modest little app it 's probably the smallest of the twenty one apps that the fellows wrote last year  
 but it 's doing something that no other government technology does  
 it 's spreading virally  
 there 's a guy in the i t department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it not for
  snow  but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens  
 it 's very important that these tsunami sirens work but people steal the batteries out of them so he 's getting citizens to check on them 
 and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains  
 and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it
  so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this and this has spread just frictionlessly organically  naturally 
 if you know anything about government technology you know that this isn 't how it normally goes  procuring software usually takes a couple of years  
 we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months it was a way that
 parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids  we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels it would have taken at least two years
 and it would have cost about two million dollars  
 and that 's nothing there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars  
 and it doesn 't work  
 and there are projects like this at every level
  so an app that takes
 a couple of days to write and then spreads virally that 's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government  
 it suggests how government could work better
 not more like a private company as many people think it should and not even like a tech company  
 but more like the internet itself  and that means permissionless  it means
  app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government
 not as the problem of an ossified institution but as a problem of collective action  
 and that 's great news because it turns out we 're very good at collective action with digital technology  
 now there 's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively
  it 's not just code for america fellows there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps
 every day in their own communities  
 they haven 't given up on government  they are frustrated as hell with it  but they 're not complaining about it they 're fixing it  
 and these folks know something that we 've lost sight of  and that 's that when you strip away all your feelings about
  politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we 're really mad about 
 government is at its core in the words of tim o 'reilly 
 what we do together that we can 't do alone 
 now a lot of people have given up on government and if you 're one of those people i would ask that you reconsider  because things are changing
  politics is not changing government is changing  and because government ultimately derives its power from us
 remember we the people how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens  
 now i didn 't know very much about government when i started this program  and like a lot of people i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office 
 well after two years
  come to the conclusion that especially local government is about opossums
  this is the call center for the services and information line it 's generally where you will get if you call three hundred and eleven in your city 
 if you should ever have the chance to staff your city 's call center as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program in fact they all do that you will find
 that people call government with a very wide range of
  issues including having an opossum stuck in your house  so scott gets this call he types opossum into this official knowledge base
  he doesn 't really come up with anything he starts with animal control and finally he says look can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves 
 so that worked so booya for scott but that wasn 't the end of the opossums  boston doesn 't just have a call center
 it has an app a web and mobile app called citizens connect 
 now we didn 't write this app this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston  so one day this is an actual report this came in opossum in my trashcan 
 can 't tell if it 's dead how do i get this removed 
  but on citizens connect everything is public so everybody can see this and in this case a neighbor saw it and the next report we got said 
 i walked over to this location found the trashcan behind the house opossum check living yep  turned trashcan on its side walked home  goodnight sweet opossum 
 pretty simple  so this is great this is the digital meeting the physical
 and it 's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd sourcing game  but it 's also a great example of government as a platform 
 and i don 't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here i 'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others  
 so one citizen helped another citizen but
  government played a key role here it connected those two people 
 and it could have connected them with government services if they 'd been needed  but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services 
 when one neighbor helps another we strengthen our communities  
 we call animal control it just costs a lot of money  
 now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it 's not the
 same thing as politics and most people get that but they think that one is the input to the other that our input to the system of government is voting  
 now how many times have we elected a political leader and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected
 and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs  
 and then not that much changes that 's because government is like a vast ocean
 and politics is the six inch layer on top  and what 's under that is what we call bureaucracy 
 and we say that word with such contempt  but it 's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own
 and we pay for
 as something that 's working against us this other thing and then we 're disempowering ourselves
  people seem to think politics is sexy  if we want this institution to work for us  we 're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy  
 because that 's where the real work of government happens  
 we have to engage with the machinery of government  so that 's 
  movement has done have you seen these guys  it 's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed
 that 's a response to the sec 's request for comment on the financial reform bill that 's not being politically active that 's being bureaucratically active  
 now for those of us who 've given up on government  it 's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children 
 you have to see the enormous challenges that they 're going to face 
 do we really think we 're going to get
  where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us 
 we can 't do without government but we do need it to be more effective 
 the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government
 in a way that can actually scale
 by strengthening civil society  and there 's a generation out there that 's grown up on the
  internet and they know that it 's not that hard to do things together you just have to architect the systems the right way  
 now the average age of our fellows is twenty eight so i am  begrudgingly almost a generation older than most of them 
 this is a generation that 's grown up taking their voices pretty much
 for granted 
 they 're not fighting that battle that we 're all fighting about who gets to speak  they all get to speak  
 they can express their opinion on any channel at any time  and they do
  so when they 're faced with the problem of government  they don 't care as much about using their voices
  they 're using their hands  
 they 're using their hands to write applications that make government work better and those applications let us use our hands
 to make our communities better that could be shoveling out a hydrant  pulling a weed  turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it 
 and certainly we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along and many people do 
 but these apps are like little digital reminders that we 're not just consumers 
 and we 're not just consumers of government putting in our taxes and getting back services
  we 're more than that we 're citizens and we 're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship 
 so the question i have for all of you here when it comes to the big important things that we need to do together all of us
  are we just going to be a crowd of voices  or are we also going to be a crowd of hands  thank you
