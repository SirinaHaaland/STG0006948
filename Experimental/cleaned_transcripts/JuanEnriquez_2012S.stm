  all good stories this starts a long long time ago when there was basically nothing  so here is a complete picture of the universe about 14 odd billion years ago 
 all energy is concentrated into a single point of energy for some reason it explodes and you begin to get
  these things  so you 're now about fourteen billion years into this  and these things expand and expand and expand into these giant galaxies and you get trillions of them 
 and within these galaxies you get these enormous dust clouds  and i want you to pay particular attention to the three little prongs in the center of this picture 
 if you take a close up of those they
  and what you 're looking at is columns of dust where there 's so much dust by the way the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles
 and what 's happening is there 's so much dust it comes together and it fuses
 and ignites a thermonuclear reaction  and so what you 're watching is the birth of stars these are stars being born out of here when enough stars
  come out they create a galaxy this one happens to be a particularly important galaxy because you are here 
 laughter and as you take a close up of this galaxy you find a relatively normal not particularly interesting star 
 by the way you 're now about two thirds of the way into this story  
 so this star doesn 't even appear until about two thirds of the way into this story  
 and then what happens is there 's enough dust left over that it doesn 't ignite into a star it becomes a
  planet  and this is about a
 little over four billion years ago  
 and soon thereafter there 's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup  
 and that creates life and life starts to expand and expand and expand until it
  now the really strange thing is life goes kaput not once not twice  but five times  
 so almost all life on earth is wiped out about five times  
 and as you 're thinking about that what happens is you get more and more complexity more and more stuff to build new things with  
 and we don 't appear until about ninety nine point nine six percent of the time
  time into this story  just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective  
 so within that context there 's two theories of the case as to why we 're all here the first theory of the case is that 's all she wrote
  under that theory we are the be all and end all of all
  and the reason for trillions of galaxies sextillions of planets is to create something that looks like that
 and something that looks like that 
 and that 's the purpose of the universe  and then it flat lines it doesn 't get any better 
 the only question you might want to ask yourself is could that be just mildly arrogant
  and if it is and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction 
 there were only about two thousand of our species left a few more weeks without rain we would have never seen any of these
  so maybe you have to think about a second theory if the first one isn 't good enough second theory is could we upgrade 
 well why would one ask a question like that because there have been at least twenty nine upgrades so far of
  so it turns out that we have upgraded we 've upgraded time and again and again and it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades  we found this one last year 
 we found another one last month  
 and as you 're thinking about this  you might also ask the question so why a single human species  
 wouldn 't it be really odd if you went to africa and asia and antarctica and found exactly the same bird
  particularly given that we  co existed at the same time with at least eight other versions of humanoid at the same time on this planet  
 so the normal state of affairs is not to have just a homo sapiens the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around  
 and if that is the normal
  of affairs then you might ask yourself all right so if we want to create something else how big does a mutation have to be 
 well svante paabo has the answer the difference between humans and neanderthal is zero point zero zero four percent of gene code 
 that 's how big the difference is one species to another 
 this explains most contemporary political debates
  but as you 're thinking about this one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place 
 difference human neanderthal is sperm and testis  smell and skin  and those are the specific genes
 that differ from one to the other so very small changes can have a big impact  and as you 're thinking about this  we 're continuing to mutate
  so about ten thousand years ago by the black sea we had one mutation in one gene
 which led to blue eyes  
 and this is continuing and continuing and continuing 
 and as it continues one of the things that 's going to happen this year is we 're going to discover the first ten thousand human genomes because it 's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing 
 and when we find these we may find differences
  and by the way this is not a debate that we 're ready for because we have really misused the science in this in the 1920s we thought there were major differences between people 
 that was partly based on francis galton 's work  he was darwin 's cousin  
 but the u s the carnegie institute stanford  american neurological association took this really far that got exported
 and was really misused in fact it led to some absolutely horrendous
  treatment of human beings  so since the 1940s we 've been saying there are no differences we 're all identical  
 we 're going to know at year end if that is true  and as we think about that we 're actually beginning to find things like 
 do you have an ace gene why would that matter because nobody 's ever climbed an
  that doesn 't have an ace gene and if you want to get more specific how about
  genotype  well it turns out that every male olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants 
 if that is true it leads to some very complicated questions for the london olympics three options  
 do you want the olympics to be a showcase for really hardworking mutants
 option number two 
 why don 't we play it like golf or sailing  because you have one and you don 't have one i 'll give you a tenth of a second head start 
 version number three because this is a naturally occurring gene and you 've got it and you didn 't pick the right parents you get the right to upgrade
  different options  if these differences are the difference between an olympic medal and a non olympic medal 
 and it turns out that as we discover these things  we human beings
 really like to change how we look how we act what our bodies do  
 and we had about ten point two million plastic surgeries in the united states except that with the technologies that are coming online today  
 today 's
  corrections deletions augmentations and enhancements
 are going to seem like child 's play 
 you already saw the work by tony atala on ted  
 but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells
 are allowing us to print
 skin  organs and a whole series of other body parts  and as these technologies go
  forward  you keep seeing this you keep seeing this you keep seeing things two thousand human genome sequence
 and it seems like nothing 's happening  until it does  
 and we may just be in some of these weeks  and as you 're thinking about these
  two guys sequencing a human genome in two thousand and the public project sequencing the human genome in two thousand
 then you don 't hear a lot until you hear about an experiment last year in china 
 where they take skin cells from this mouse put four chemicals on it 
 turn those skin cells into stem cells  let the stem cells grow and create a full copy of that mouse 
 that 's a big deal
  because in essence what it means is you can take a cell which is a pluripotent stem cell  which is like a skier at the top of a mountain  
 and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells four eight sixteen  and then it gets so crowded after sixteen divisions
 that those cells have to differentiate so they go down one side of the mountain they go down another  and as they pick that
  these become bone  and then they pick another road and these become platelets  
 and these become macrophages and these become t cells but it 's really hard once you ski down to get back up 
 unless of course if you have a ski lift  
 and what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part
 and as you think of that what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism
 out of any one of its cells 
 that turns out to be a big deal because now you can take not just mouse cells  but you can human skin cells
 and turn them into human stem cells and then what they did in october is
 they took skin cells turned them into stem cells
 and began to turn them into liver cells  so in theory you could grow any organ from any one of your cells  
 here 's a second experiment if you could photocopy your body  
 maybe you also want to take your mind and one of the things you saw at ted about a year and a half ago
 was this guy
 and he gave a wonderful technical talk he 's a professor at mit  
 but in essence what he said is you can take retroviruses which get inside brain cells of mice 
 you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them 
 and you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees
  then you can take a fiber optic cable
 and light up some of the same things  
 and by the way as you do this  you can image it in two colors which means you can download this information as binary code
 directly into a computer so what 's the bottom line on that well it 's
  not completely inconceivable that someday you 'll be able to download your own memories maybe into a new body  
 and maybe you can upload other people 's memories as well  
 and this might have just one or two small ethical political moral implications 
 laughter just a thought  here 's the kind of questions that are becoming interesting questions for philosophers for governing people
  for
 economists for scientists because these technologies are moving really quickly  
 and as you think about it let me close with an example of the brain 
 the first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today  
 both because of the inputs which are becoming massive and because of the plasticity of the organ 
 is the brain
  we have any evidence that that is happening  
 well let 's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand  here 's what it looks like in two thousand here 's what it looks like in 
 two thousand and two 
 here 's the increase in less than a decade  and we still don 't know why this is happening
  what we do know is potentially the brain is reacting in a hyperactive 
 and creating individuals that are like this  and this is only one of the conditions that 's out there you 've also got
 people with who are extraordinarily smart people who can remember everything they 've seen in their lives people who 've got synesthesia people who 've got
  all kinds of stuff going on out there and we still don 't understand how and why this is happening  
 but one question you might want to ask is are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data 
 because when you think of how much data 's coming into our brains  we 're trying to take in as much data in a day as people used to take in in a lifetime  
 and as you 're thinking
  there 's four theories as to why this might be going on plus a whole series of others i don 't have a good answer  there really needs to be more research on this 
 one option is the fast food fetish 
 there 's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications which may or may not have an impact
 on how the brain of an infant works a second option is the sexy geek option
  these conditions are highly rare 
 applause but what 's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is
  so this is the assortative mating hypothesis
 of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures 
 the third is this too much information  
 we 're trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything 
 other people get
  amount of information other people react with
 various psychological conditions or reactions to this information or maybe it 's chemicals 
 but when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition either you 're not measuring it right or there 's something going on very quickly  
 and it may be evolution in real time 
 here 's the bottom line 
 what i think
  we are doing is we 're transitioning as a species  and i didn 't think this when steve gullans and i started writing together 
 i think we 're transitioning into homo evolutis that for better or worse is not just a hominid that 's conscious of his or her environment 
 it 's a hominid that 's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species 
 of bacteria of
  plants of animals and i think that 's such an order of magnitude change that your grandkids or your 
 may be a species very different from you thank you very much
