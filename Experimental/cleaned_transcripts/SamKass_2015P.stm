  i am a chef and a food policy guy
 but i come from a whole family of teachers my sister is a special ed teacher in chicago my father just retired
  years teaching fifth grade  my aunt and uncle were professors my cousins all teach everybody in my family basically teaches except for me 
 they taught me
 that the only way to get the right answers
 is to ask the right questions  so what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for
  there 's obviously many important questions  but i think the following is a good place to start 
 what do we think the connection is between a child 's growing mind and their growing body  
 what can we expect our kids to learn
 if their diets are full of sugar
 and empty of nutrients what can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally
  going hungry  
 and with all the resources that we are pouring into schools 
 we should stop and ask ourselves are we really setting our kids up for success 
 now a few years ago 
 i was a judge on a cooking competition called chopped four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes
  except for this episode
 it was a very special one instead of four overzealous chefs trying to break into the limelight something that i would know nothing about 
 these chefs were school chefs 
 you know the women that you used to call lunch ladies but the ones i insist we call school chefs 
  these women god bless these women spend their day cooking for thousands of kids breakfast and lunch with only 
  six eight per lunch with only about a dollar of that actually going
 to the food 
 in this episode the main course mystery ingredient was quinoa  
 now i know it 's been a long time since most of you have had a school lunch
 and we 've made a lot of progress on nutrition but quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias
 so this was a challenge  
 but the dish that i i will never forget was cooked by a woman named cheryl barbara  
 cheryl was the nutrition director at high school in the community in connecticut 
 she cooked this delicious pasta  it was amazing  it was a pappardelle with italian sausage kale parmesan
  basically just threw the quinoa pretty much uncooked into the dish it was a strange choice  and it was
 super crunchy  so i took on the tv
 accusatory judge thing
 that it 's a monday 
 and that in my school at high school in the community i always cook pasta see cheryl explained that for many of her kids  
 there were no meals on the weekends 
 no meals on saturday  
 no meals on
  she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew
 her children would eat something that would stick to their ribs she said 
 something that would fill them up 
 cheryl talked about how by the time monday came her
  hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn 't even begin to think about learning food was the only thing
 on their mind 
 the only thing 
 and unfortunately the stats they tell the same story so let 's put this into the context of a child  
 and we 're going to focus on the most important meal of the day 
  meet allison she 's twelve years old  she 's smart as a whip and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up if allison goes to a school
 that serves a nutritious breakfast to all of their kids  here 's what 's going to follow 
 her chances of getting a nutritious meal one with fruit and milk one lower in sugar and salt dramatically increase 
 allison
 will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid she 'll have to visit the nurse less
  she 'll have lower levels of anxiety and depression she 'll have better behavior  she 'll have better attendance and she 'll show up on time more often why  
 well  because there 's a good meal waiting for her at school 
 overall  allison is in much better health
 than the average school kid  so what about that kid who doesn 't have a nutritious breakfast waiting for
 he 's also twelve he 's a wonderful kid  he wants to be a doctor by the time tommy is in kindergarten he 's already underperforming in math 
 by the time he 's in third grade  he 's got lower math and reading scores 
 by the time he 's eleven it 's more likely that tommy will have to have repeated a grade  
 research shows that kids who do not have
  consistent nourishment particularly at breakfast have poor cognitive function
 overall  
 so how widespread is this problem  well  unfortunately it 's pervasive  
 let me give you two stats that seem like they 're on opposite ends of the of the issue but are actually two sides of the same coin
  on the one hand  one in six americans are food insecure  including sixteen million children almost twenty percent
 are food insecure in this city alone in new york city four hundred and seventy four thousand kids under the age of eighteen
 face hunger every year it
 's crazy on the other hand  diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country
  by far  and fully a third of the kids that we 've been talking about tonight are on track to have diabetes in their lifetime  
 now what 's hard to put together but is true is that many times these are the same children 
 so they fill up on on the unhealthy and cheap calories that surround them in their communities
 and that their families can afford  but then by the
  the month food stamps run out or hours get cut at work  and they don 't have the money to cover the basic cost of food  
 but
 we should be able to solve this problem right we know what the answers are as part of my work at the white house we instituted a program
 that for all schools that had forty percent more low income kids we could serve
  breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school for free this program has been incredibly successful because it helped us overcome
 a very difficult barrier when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast and that was the barrier of stigma 
 see schools serve
  it was only available for the poor kids 
 so everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help  
 now all kids  no matter how much or how little their parents make have a lot of pride  
 so what happened  well the schools that have
  saw an increase in math and reading scores by seventeen point five percent seventeen point five percent  
 and research shows that when kids have a consistent nutritious breakfast 
 their chances of graduating increase by twenty percent twenty
 percent when we give our kids the nourishment they need we give them the chance to thrive
  both in the classroom and beyond  
 now  you don 't have to trust me on this but you should talk to donna martin  
 i love donna martin  donna martin is the school nutrition director at burke county
 in waynesboro georgia burke county is one of the poorest districts in the fifth poorest state in the country  and about one hundred percent
 of donna 's
  students
 live at or below the poverty line 
 a few years ago donna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming  and overhaul her nutrition standards  
 she improved
 and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains  she served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids  and she implemented a dinner program why
  many of her kids didn 't have dinner when they went home  
 so how did they respond  well the kids loved the food 
 they loved the better nutrition  and they loved not being hungry  
 but donna 's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place 
 his name from eric parker and he was the head football coach for the burke county bears
 now  coach parker had coached mediocre teams for years the bears often ended in the middle of the pack a
 big disappointment in one of the most passionate football states in the union  but the year
 donna changed the menus the bears not only won
 their division  they went on to win the state championship  beating the peach county trojans
 and coach parker  he credited that championship to donna martin  
 when we give our kids the basic nourishment they 're going to thrive  
 and it 's not just up to the cheryl barbaras and the donna martins of the world it 's on all of us and feeding our
  kids
 the basic nutrition is just the starting point what i 've laid out is really a model for so many of the most pressing issues that we face 
 if we focus on the simple goal
 of properly nourishing ourselves we could see a world that is more stable and secure 
 we could dramatically improve our economic productivity
 we could transform our health care
 and we could go a long way in ensuring that the earth can provide for generations to come food
 is that place where our collective efforts
 can have the greatest impact  so we have to ask ourselves what is the right question what would happen
 if we
 fed ourselves
 more nutritious more sustainably grown food  what would be the impact  cheryl barbara  
 donna martin  coach parker and the burke county bears
 i think they know the answer  thank you guys so very much
