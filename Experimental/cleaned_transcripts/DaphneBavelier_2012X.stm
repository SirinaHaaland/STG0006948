  as a brain scientist i 'm actually interested in how the brain learns  
 and i 'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter better
  and faster 
 this is in this context i 'm going to tell you about video games  when we say video games most of you think about children it
 's true  ninety percent of children do play video games  
 but
 let 's be frank  when the kids are in bed who is in front of the playstation 
 most of you  the average age of a gamer is thirty three years old not eight years old
  and in fact if we look at the projected demographics of video game play the video game players of tomorrow are
 older adults 
 so video [ gaming ] is pervasive throughout our society  
 it is clearly here to stay  
 it has an amazing impact on our everyday life consider these statistics released by activision
  after one month of release of the game call of duty black ops it had been played for 
 thousand years
 worldwide  right  would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra  so
  asking in the lab is how can we leverage that power  
 now i want to step back a bit  
 i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games 
 the name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you right  
 and
 i 'm almost sure most of you have
  you do something more intelligent
 than shooting at zombies 
 i 'd like you to put this kind of knee jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku
 or your boy reading shakespeare  right  most parents would find that great
 well i 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health
  it 's not and binging is never good  
 but i 'm going to argue that in reasonable doses actually the very game i showed you at the beginning those action packed shooter games
 have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior  
 there 's not one week that goes without some major headlines in
  media about whether video games are good or bad for you right  you 're all bombarded with that 
 i 'd like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab  
 what we do in the lab is actually measure directly in a quantitative fashion  what is the impact of video games on the brain  
 and so i 'm going to take a
  few examples from our work one first saying that i 'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse  
 that 's a statement about vision  
 there may be vision scientists among you we actually know how to test that statement we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision
  guess what 
 people that don 't play a lot of action games that don 't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens have normal or what we call  corrective to normal vision  that 's okay  
 the issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week ten hours per week fifteen hours per week by that statement their vision should be really bad right  
 guess what their vision is really really good it 's better than those that
  in two different ways  
 the first way is that they 're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter  and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription
 rather than using magnifier glasses  you can actually do it with just your eyesight  
 the other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve
 different levels of gray  imagine you 're driving in a fog
  that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident or getting into an accident  
 so we 're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision  
 and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better 
 clearly when it comes to action video games screen time doesn 't make your eyesight worse
  another saying that i 'm sure you have all heard around video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability  
 okay  
 we know how to measure attention in the lab i
 'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so i 'm going to ask you to participate so you 're going to have to actually play the game
  going to show you colored words  i want you to shout out the color of the ink  right so this is the first example
 because i introduced a conflict
 between the word itself and its color 
 how good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict so the young guys here at the top of their game probably like did a little better than some of us that are older
  what we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games they actually resolve the conflict faster
  so clearly playing those action games doesn 't lead to attention problems 
 actually those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world 
 this is something we use all the time when you 're driving
  you 're tracking keeping track of the cars around you you 're also keeping track of the pedestrian  the running dog and that 's how you can actually be safe driving right 
 in the lab  we get people to come to the lab sit in front of a computer screen and we give them little tasks that i 'm going to get you to do again 
 you 're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces these are children in the schoolyard in geneva during a recess during the winter 
  kids are happy  it 's actually recess but a few kids are sad and blue because they 've forgotten their coat 
 everybody begins to move around and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn 't 
 so i 'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid it 's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes you can track you can track and then when it stops and there is a question mark and i ask you 
 did this kid have a coat
  or not was it yellow initially or blue  
 i hear a few yellow good so most of you have a brain i 'm now going to ask you
 to do the task but now with a little more challenging task there are going to be three of them that are blue 
 don 't move your eyes please don 't move your eyes  keep your eyes fixated and expand pull your attention that 's the only way you can actually do it if you move your eyes you 're doomed
 yellow or blue audience 
 yellow db good so your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention that 's what we just did 
 your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention which is
 what is shown in this video here  that 's for you guys
  we actually see the effects of video games on people 's behavior  we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain and we do find 
 many changes but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention
 so one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention  
 the other one is the frontal lobe which controls how we sustain attention 
 and another one is the anterior cingulate which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict 
 now when we do brain imaging we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action
  games  
 this actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain  
 you all know about multitasking  you all have been faulty of multitasking when you 're driving and you pick up your cellphone 
 bad idea very bad idea  why because as your attention shifts to your
 you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you and so you 're much more likely to get
 engaged into a car accident  
 now we can measure that kind of skills in the lab  we obviously don 't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have that would be a little costly
  but we design tasks on the computer where we can measure to millisecond accuracy how good they are at switching from one task to another 
 when we do that we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really really good they switch really fast very swiftly they pay a very small cost now i 'd like
 you to remember that result  and put it in the context of another group of technology users a group which is actually much revered by society
  which are people that engage in 
  the fact that most of us most of our children are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they 're doing search on the web at the same time as they 're chatting on facebook with their friends  
 that 's a 
 there was a first study done by colleagues at stanford and that we replicated that
  showed that those people that identify as being high 
 are absolutely abysmal at multitasking when we measure them in the lab they 're really bad  
 right  so these kinds of results really makes two main points  the first one is that not all media are created equal  
 you can 't compare the effect of
  and the effect of playing action games they have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition perception
 and attention  
 even within video games i 'm telling you right now about these action packed video games  different video games have a different effect on your brains 
 so we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game  
 the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no
  weight i showed that to you already like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time those action gamers have a lot
 of very good vision  etc  here  what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high 
 are convinced they aced the test  so you show them their data you show them they are bad and
  not possible you know they have this sort of gut feeling that really they are doing really really good  
 that 's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain 
 now in a sense when we think about
 the effect of video games on the brain it 's very similar to the effect of wine on the health there are some very poor uses
  of wine there are some very poor uses of video games  
 but when consumed in reasonable doses  and at the right age 
 wine can be very good for health there are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater
  so it 's the same way like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity learning attention vision  etc 
  and so we need and we 're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them
  patients we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform 
 i 'm much more interested in taking any of you
 and showing that by forcing you to play an action game i can actually change your vision for the better 
 whether you want to play that action game or not right that 's the point of rehabilitation or education most of the kids don 't go to school
  saying great two hours of math so that 's really
 the crux of the research and to do that we need to go one more step and one more step is to do training studies  
 so let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation 
 mental rotation is
 a task where i 'm going to ask you and again you 're going to do
  the task 
 to look at this shape study it it 's a target shape  
 and i 'm going to present to you four different shapes one of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape  i want you to tell me which one 
 the first one second one  third one or fourth one okay 
 i 'll help you fourth one one more get those brains
  come on  that 's our target shape  
 third good
  this is hard right like the reason that i asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing right it doesn 't really feel like playing mindless action video games  well  what we do in these training studies is people come to the lab they do tasks like this one  
 we then force them to
  play ten hours of action games  they don 't play ten hours of action games in a row they do distributed practice so little shots of forty minutes
 several days over a period of two weeks then
 once they are done with the training they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task  
 so this is work from a colleague in toronto what they showed is that initially
 subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age  
 after two weeks of training on action video games  they actually perform better and
 the improvement is still there five months after having done the training  that 's really really important  why
  because i told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation we need to have effects that are going to be long lasting now
 at this point a number of you are probably wondering well what are you waiting
 for to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy 
 or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has
 five months after
