  here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse basil jones but actually we 're going to start this evolution
 with a hyena ak the ancestor of the
  the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called faustus in africa a handspring production from one thousand nine 
 where it had to play draughts with helen of troy this production was directed by south african artist and theater director william kentridge
  so it needed a very articulate front paw 
 but like all puppets it has other attributes bj 
 one of them is breath
  and it kind of breathes ak haa haa haaa bj 
 breath is really important for us  it 's the kind
 kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage  it 's the thing that distinguishes the puppet ak oops bj 
 from an actor 
 puppets always have to try to be alive it 's their kind of
  ur story onstage that desperation to live ak yeah it 's basically a dead object as you can see  and it
  lives because you make it an actor struggles to die onstage but a puppet has to struggle to live and in a way that 's a metaphor for life bj 
 so every moment it 's on the stage  it 's making the struggle so we we call this
 a piece of emotional engineering that uses
  actually i prefer to say that it 's an object constructed out of wood and cloth
 with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life bj 
 okay so ak it has ears that move passively when the head goes bj and it has these bulkheads
 made out of plywood covered with fabric
 curiously similar
  fact to the plywood canoes that adrian 's father used to make when he was a boy
 in their workshop ak in port elizabeth the village outside port elizabeth in south africa bj his mother was a puppeteer 
 and when we met at art school and fell in love in one thousand nine 
 i hated puppets i really thought they were so beneath me i wanted to become an
 avant garde artist and punch and judy was certainly not where i wanted to go 
 and in fact it took about ten years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa where there 's a fabulous tradition of puppetry 
 to learn a renewed  or
 a new respect
  persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company and
 twenty years later  miraculously 
 we collaborated with a company from mali the sogolon marionette troupe of bamako 
 where we made a piece about a tall giraffe it was just called tall horse which was a life sized giraffe bj and here again you see the same structure the bulkheads have now turned into
 hoops of cane  but it 's ultimately the same structure it 's got two people inside
  it on stilts which give them the height and somebody in the front who 's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head ak the person in the hind
 legs is also controlling the tail a bit like the hyena same mechanism just a bit bigger  and he 's controlling the the ear movement bj 
  this production
 was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london  and just around that time 
 his mother had said have you seen this this book by michael morpurgo called ' war horse ' ak it 's about a boy who falls in love with a horse the horse is 
  sold to the first world war  and he joins up to find his horse bj so tom gave us a call and said 
  idea bj but it had to ride it had to have a rider ak it had to have a rider and it had to participate in cavalry charges a
 play about early 20th century plowing technology and
 cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london but they agreed to go along with it for a
  who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse  and our next door neighbor katherine 
 riding on a ladder  the weight is really difficult when it 's up above your head ak 
 and once we put katherine through that particular brand of hell  we knew that we might be able to make a horse  which could be ridden  so we made a model this is a cardboard model a little bit smaller than the hyena you 'll notice
 that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there bj and the two manipulators are inside  but we didn 't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator because we couldn 't manipulate
 the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time ak 
 we started work on the prototype after the model was approved and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated
  we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones  and we had a crate built for it it had to be shipped to london we were going to test drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town and it got to midnight and we hadn 't done that yet bj 
 so we got a camera  
 and we posed the puppet in various
  we sent it off to the national theatre  hoping that they believed that we created something that worked ak 
 a month later we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us
 bj about forty people ak we were terrified we opened the lid we took the horse out  and it did work it walked and it was able to be ridden
  clip of the very first walk of
 of the prototype this is in the national theatre studio the place where they cook new ideas it had by no means got the green light yet
 the choreographer toby sedgwick invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse  which was made out of sticks and
  and bits of twigs  grew up into the big horse  and
 nick starr the director of the national theatre  saw that particular moment he was standing next to me he nearly wet himself  and so the show was given the green light and
 we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely here is the plan 
 and here is our factory in cape
  town where we make horses you can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there  
 the horses are completely handmade there is very little 20th century technology in them we used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces 
 but because they have to be light and flexible  and each one of them is different they can 't be
  here are some half finished horses
 ready to be worked in london  and now we would like to introduce you
 to joey  joey boy you there
  like to describe i won 't talk too loud he might get irritated
  craig is working the head he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand  each one of them
 operates either an ear  separately
  or the head up and down but he also controls the head directly by using his hand
  the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse  when they point right back
 the horse is fearful or angry  depending upon what 's going on in front of him around him  or when he 's more relaxed the head comes down and
 the ears listen either side 
 horses ' hearing is very important it 's almost more important than their eyesight  
  what you call the heart position he
 's working the leg you see the string tendon from the hyena  the hyena 's front leg  
 automatically pulls the hoop up 
 horses are so unpredictable 
 the way a hoof comes up with a horse
 immediately gives you the feeling that it 's a convincing horse action the hind legs have got the same action 
 bj and mikey also has in his
 fingers  the ability to move the tail from left to right and up and down
 with the other hand and together there 's quite a complex possibility
  tail expression ak you want to say something about the breathing 
 bj we had a big challenge with breathing adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that because that 's how a horse 
 would breathe with an expanded chest but we realized that if that were to be happening you wouldn 't  as an audience see the
  so he made a channel in here and the chest moves up and down in that channel so 
  really the up and down movement but it feels like breath  and it 's very very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer
 breathes with his knees ak 
 other emotional stuff  if i were to touch the horse here on his skin 
  puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver 
 you 'll notice of course that the puppet is made out of cane lines and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice that i was making a three dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space
 but of course  it was the cane is light the cane is flexible the cane is durable and the cane is moldable  and so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane
  is made out of a see through nylon mesh  which if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear she can
 light the background and the horse
 becomes ghostlike you see the the skeletal structure of it or if you light it from above it becomes more solid  again  that was a practical consideration the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out they have to be able to act along
  with their fellow actors in in the production and it 's very much an in the moment activity that they 're engaged in  it 's three heads making one character  
 but now we would like you to put
 joey through some paces
  all the way from sunny california we have zem joaquin who 's going to ride the horse
  so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is
 three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly bj not being able to talk to one another while they 're onstage because
 the sound that that very large chest makes of the horse the whinnying and the nickering and everything that starts usually with one performer 
  carries on with a second person and ends with a third
