  i want to open by quoting
 einstein 's wonderful statement just so people will feel at ease
 that the great scientist of the  20th century also agrees with us  and also calls us to this action  
 he said a human being is a part of the whole called by us
 a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest 
 a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness 
 this delusion is a kind of prison for us  restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us 
 our task must be to free ourselves from this prison
 by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty 
 this insight of einstein 's is uncannily close to that of buddhist psychology  wherein compassion karuna it is called
 is defined as the sensitivity to another 's suffering
 and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering it pairs closely
  with love  which is the will for the other to be happy  which requires of course that one feels some happiness oneself
 and wishes to share it this is perfect in that it clearly opposes 
 and selfishness to compassion  the concern for others and further it indicates that those caught in the cycle of 
 suffer helplessly  while the compassionate
  are more free and implicitly more happy  
 the dalai lama often states that compassion is his best friend 
 it helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair 
 compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute  most terrible suffering
 anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others  even of the perpetrators of his
  misery
 and the whole mass of beings 
 in fact suffering is so huge and enormous his own becomes less and less monumental  
 and he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others and this immediately cheers him up 
 as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion
  he uses his own suffering
 as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion  
 he is a very good colleague of einstein 's we must say 
 now i want to tell a story which is a very famous story in the indian and buddhist tradition of the great saint asanga who was a
 contemporary of augustine in the west and was sort of like the buddhist augustine 
 and asanga lived eight hundred
  years after the buddha 's time 
 and he was discontented with the state of people 's practice of the buddhist religion in india at that time 
 and so he said i 'm sick of all this nobody 's really living the doctrine they 're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment but they are acting selfish and pathetic  
 so  buddha 's teaching has lost its momentum i know the next buddha will come a few thousand years from now but exists currently in a certain
  that 's maitreya 
 so i 'm going to go on a retreat and i 'm going to meditate and pray until the buddha maitreya reveals himself to me  
 and gives me a teaching or something to revive
 the practice of compassion in the world today so he went on this retreat 
 and he meditated for three years and he did not see the future buddha maitreya and he left in disgust  and as he was leaving he saw
 a man a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain and
 had a lump of iron  and he was rubbing it with a cloth  
 and he became interested in that he said well what are you doing and the man said i 'm making a needle 
 and he said that 's ridiculous you can 't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth and the man said really and he showed him a dish full of needles so he said
  i get the point he went back to his cave he meditated again  another three years no vision  he leaves again 
 this time he comes down and as he 's leaving he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge  
 and where it 's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff 
 its feathers brushes the rock and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in there was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds
  another three years  again no vision of maitreya after nine years and he again leaves and this time water dripping making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips
 in a stream  and so again he goes back and after twelve years there is still no vision  
 and he 's freaked out and he won 't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision and he comes to
  a broken person and there in the town he 's approached by a dog who comes
 like this one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries  even in america i think in some areas and he 's looking just terrible  
 and he becomes interested in this dog because it 's so pathetic and it 's trying to attract his attention and he sits down looking at the dog and the dog 's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore 
 some of it is like gangrenous and there
  terrible he thinks what can i do to fix up this dog well at least i can clean this wound and wash it so he takes it to some water he 's about to clean but then
 his awareness focuses on the maggots and he sees the maggots and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute and they 're maggoting happily in the dog 's hindquarters there well
 if i clean the dog i 'll kill
  a useless person and there 's no buddha no maitreya and everything is all hopeless  and now i 'm going to kill the maggots so he had a brilliant idea  
 and he took a shard of something and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh  
 and he placed it on ground  he was not really thinking too carefully about the aspca 
 he was just immediately caught with the situation 
  i will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh then clean the dog 's wounds  and then i 'll figure out what to do with the maggots 
 so he starts to do that he can 't grab the maggots apparently they wriggle around they 're kind of hard to grab these maggots so he says well i 'll put my tongue
 on the dog 's flesh  and then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue the dog is kind of used up and then i 'll spit them one by one
  so he goes down and he 's sticking his tongue out like this and
 he had to close his eyes it 's so disgusting and the smell and everything  and then suddenly there 's a pfft a noise like that he jumps back
 and there of course is the future buddha maitreya
 in a beautiful vision rainbow lights golden jeweled a plasma body an exquisite mystic vision that he sees  and he
 so as he comes up from his first bow he says my lord i 'm so happy to see you but
 where have you been for twelve years what is this and maitreya says i was with you who do you think was making needles
 and making nests and dripping on rocks for you  mister dense
 and until you have real compassion you cannot recognize love maitreya means love the loving one in sanskrit  
 and so he looked very dubious asanga did and he said if you don 't believe me just take me with you 
 and so he took the maitreya it shrunk into a globe a ball took him on his shoulder 
  the future buddha has come ahead of all predictions here he is and then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him it wasn 't chautauqua it was some other town
 because they saw a demented looking scrawny looking yogi man like some kind of hippie with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder  shouting that 
  the future buddha had come  so naturally they chased him out of town  but on the edge of town one elderly lady
  charwoman in the charnel ground 
 saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog but she saw the jewel foot of the maitreya and she offered a flower so that encouraged him 
 and he went with maitreya maitreya then took him to a certain heaven which is the typical way a buddhist myth unfolds and maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years
  dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion 
 and then i thought i would share with you what that method is or one of them a famous one it 's called the sevenfold causal
 method of developing compassion and it begins first by one meditating
 and visualizing that all beings are with one
 even animals too but everyone is in human form the animals are in one of their human lives  the humans are human and
  then  among them you think of your friends and loved ones the circle at the table  and you think of your enemies and you think of the neutral ones  
 and then you try to say well the loved ones i love  
 but  you know after all they 're nice to me i had fights with them sometimes they were unfriendly i got mad brothers can fight  parents and children can fight so in a way i like them so much because they 're nice to me 
 while the neutral ones i don 't know  they could all be just fine
  fine
 and then the enemies i don 't like because they 're mean to me  
 but they they are nice to somebody  i could be them and then the buddhists of course think that because we 've all had infinite previous lives
 we 've all been each other 's relatives  actually therefore all of you in the buddhist view in some previous life although you don 't remember it and neither do i 
 have been my mother
 for which i do
  apologize for the trouble i caused you and also actually i 've been your mother
 i 've been female and i 've been every single one of yours ' mother in a previous life the way the buddhists reflect  
 so my mother in this life is really great but all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother you gave me that expression the eternal mama you said  that 's wonderful so
  the way the buddhists do it  a theist christian can think that all beings even my enemies are god 's children so in that sense we 're related
 so they first create this foundation of equality  so we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love just in the meditation
 and we open our mind to those we don 't know  and we definitely reduce the hostility and the i don 't want to be compassionate to them to the ones we think of as the bad guys the ones we hate
 and we don 't like and we don 't hate anyone therefore
  so we equalize that 's very important and then the next thing we do is what is called mother recognition 
 and that is 
 we think of every being as familiar as family  we expand we take the feeling about remembering a mama 
 and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation and we see the mother in every being we see that look that the mother has on her face
 looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body  being a mammal 
 where she has true compassion truly is the other and identifies completely often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life  and that 's why it 's the most powerful form of altruism  the mother is the model of all altruism for for human beings
  in spiritual traditions  and so we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings people laugh at me because you know
 i used to say that i used to meditate
 on mama cheney
 as my mom when of course i was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in iraq  
 i used to meditate on george bush he 's quite a cute mom in a female form he has his little ears and he smiles
 and he rocks you in his arms and you think of him as nursing you
  and then saddam hussein 's serious mustache is a problem but
 you think of him as a mom and this is the way you do it you take any being who looks weird to you and you see how they could be familiar to you  and you do that for a while 
  until you really feel that you can feel the familiarity of all beings nobody seems alien they 're not 
  you reduce the feeling of otherness about beings  then you move from there to
 remembering the kindness of mothers in general if you can remember the kindness of your own mother if you can remember the kindness of your spouse or if you are a mother yourself how you were with your 
  children  and you begin to get very sentimental you cultivate sentimentality intensely you will even weep perhaps with gratitude and kindness  
 can be motherly  and then third you step from there to what is called a feeling of gratitude you want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you  
 and then the fourth step you go to what is called lovely love in each one of these you can take some weeks or months or days depending on how you do it or you can do them in a run this meditation  
 and then you think of
 how lovely beings are when they are happy
 when they are satisfied 
 and every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness 
 their face doesn 't look like this when they 're angry they look ugly every being but when they 're happy they look beautiful and so you see beings in their potential happiness  and you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy even the enemy
  we think jesus is being unrealistic when he says love thine enemy 
 he does say that 
 and we think he 's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin nice for him to say it but i can 't do that 
 but actually that 's practical if you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy  if your enemy was really happy  why would they bother to be your enemy how boring to run 
  around chasing you  they would be relaxing somewhere having a good time  so it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy because they 'll stop being your enemy because that 's too much trouble
 that 's the lovely love and then finally  the fifth step
 is compassion universal compassion 
 and that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of  
 and you look at them and you see how they are and you realize how unhappy they are actually  mostly  most of the time you see that furrowed brow in people 
 and then you realize they don 't even have compassion on themselves  they 're driven by this duty and this obligation i have to get that
  i need more i 'm not worthy and i should do something and they 're rushing around all stressed out 
 and they think of it as somehow macho hard discipline on themselves  but actually they are cruel to themselves and of course they are cruel and ruthless toward others and they then never get any positive feedback and the more they succeed and the more power they have the more unhappy they are  
  and the choice of the action of course  hopefully will be more practical than poor asanga 
 who was fixing the maggots on the dog  because
 he had that motivation and whoever was in front of him he wanted to help but of course that is impractical he should have founded the aspca in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots and i 'm sure he did that later
 laughter but
 that just indicates the state of mind you know 
 and so the next step the sixth step beyond universal compassion
 is this thing where you 're linked with the needs of others in a true way  
 and you have compassion for yourself also and
 it isn 't sentimental only  you might be in fear of something some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people
 and getting punished in the future
  for it in various ways and in buddhism they catch it in the future life of course in theistic religion they 're punished by god or whatever and materialism they think they get out of it just by not existing by dying but they don 't  
 and so they get reborn as whatever
  through true compassion  what is called universal responsibility 
  the great teaching of his holiness the dalai lama that he always teaches everywhere he says that that is the common religion of humanity kindness but kindness means universal responsibility and that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us  we are responsible for
  and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it we absolutely must do that there is no way not to do it 
 and then finally that leads to a new orientation in life
 where we live
 equally for ourselves and 
 for others and we are joyful and happy one thing we mustn 't think is that compassion
 compassion makes you miserable compassion makes you happy  the first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself  
 even if you haven 't done anything yet for anybody else  although  the change in your mind already does something for other beings they can sense this new quality in yourself  and it helps them already and gives them an example 
 and that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it 's all over  so 
  read the charter disseminate it and develop it within yourself don 't just think well i 'm compassionate or i 'm not compassionate and sort of think you 're stuck there you can develop 
  this you can diminish the non compassion the cruelty  the callousness the neglect of others and take universal responsibility for them
