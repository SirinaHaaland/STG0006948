  an event seen from one point of view gives one impression  
 seen from another point of view  it gives quite a different impression  
 but it 's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand
  what 's going on sasha vucinic 
 it 's a great clip isn 't it and i found that in twenty nine seconds it tells
 more about the power of and importance of independent media than i could say in
 an hour  so i thought that it will be good to start with it
  and also start with a little bit of statistics  according to relevant researchers
 eighty three percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press 
 think about that number eighty three percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know
 what is going on in their countries the information they get gets filtered through somebody
 who either twists that information or colors that
  information does something with it  so they 're deprived of understanding their reality  
 that is just to understand how big and important this problem is now
 those
 of you who are lucky enough to to live in those societies that represent seventeen percent  i think should enjoy it until
 you know sunday morning you flick the paper get your cappuccino  enjoy it while it lasts because as we heard yesterday
  countries can lose stars from their their flags  but they can also lose
 press freedom as i guess americans among us can tell
  that 's totally another and separate topic  so i can go
 back to my story my story
 starts the story i want to share starts in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one at that time i was running b92 the only independent 
 for that matter the only electronic media in the country  and i guess we were sharing we had that
 regular life of the only independent media in the country  operating in
  hostile environment where government really wants to make your life miserable and there are different ways yeah it was the usual cocktail a little bit of threats a little bit of
 friendly advice a little bit of financial police a little bit of
 text control so you always have somebody who never leaves your office
  but what they really do which is very powerful and that is what governments in the late
  late ' 90s started doing if they don 't like independent media companies you know they threaten your advertisers  once they threaten your advertisers  
 market forces are actually you know 
 destroyed and the
 advertisers do not want to come
 no matter how much does it make sense for them do not want to come and advertise  and you have a problem making ends meet
  that time at the beginning of the ' 90s we had that problem which was you know survival below one side but what was really
 painful for me was remember the beginning of the ' 90s yugoslavia is falling apart we were sitting over there
 with a country in a downfall  in a slow motion downfall  
  had all of that on tapes we had
 the ability to understand what was going on we were actually recording history the problem was
 that we had to re tape that history a week later because if we did not we could not afford
 enough tapes to keep archives of that history  so
 if i gave you that picture i don 't want to go too long on that in that context
 a gentleman came to my office at that time it was still
 he was running a media systems organization which is still in business the gentleman is still in business  and what did i know at that time about media systems i would think
 media systems were organizations which means
 they should help you  so i prepared two plans for that meeting two strategic plans the small one and the big
  small one was i just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes  so we can keep that archive for the next fifty years the big plan was
 to ask him for a 1 000 000 dollar loan  
 because i thought i
 still maintain  that serious and independent media companies are great business  and i thought that b92 will survive
 and be a great company once milosevic is gone  which turned out to be true it 's now probably either the
  or the second biggest media company in the country  and i thought that the only thing that we needed at that time 
  loan to take us through those hard times to make a long story short the gentleman comes
 into the office great suit and tie i gave him what i thought was a brilliant
 explanation of
 the political situation
  and explained how hard and difficult the war will be 
 actually i underestimated the atrocities i have to admit  anyway after that whole big long explanation 
 the only question he had for me and this is not a joke
 is are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of michael jackson 
 that was really the only question he had
  left and i remember being
 being
 actually very angry at myself because i thought
 there must be an institution in the world
 that is providing loans to media companies it 's so obvious  straight in your face and somebody must have thought of it  somebody must have
 started something like that and i thought i 'm just dumb
 and i cannot find it
  in my defense there was no google at that time you could not just google in '
 ninety one so i thought that that 's actually my problem  now we go from here fast forward to 
 i have i left the country  i have a meeting with george soros  trying for the third time to convince him that
  foundation should invest in something that should operate like
 a media bank  and basically what i was saying is very simple  you know forget about charity it doesn 't work forget about
 handouts twenty thousand dollars do not
 help anybody  what you should do is you should treat media companies as a business
  it 's business anywhere media business or any other business it needs to be capitalized  and what these guys need actually is access to capital  
 so third meeting  arguments are pretty well exercised at the end of the meeting he says  look  
 it is not going to work  you will never see your money back but
 my foundations will put five hundred thousand dollars so you can
  see that it will not work  he said i 'll give you a rope to hang yourself 
 i knew
 two things after that meeting first under no circumstances i want to hang myself and second
  that i have no idea how to make it work you
 see at the level of a concept it was a great concept  but it 's one thing to have a concept it 's a totally separate thing to
  actually make it work  
 so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work  had the wrong idea i thought that we can be a bank you
 see banks i don 't know if there are any bankers over here i apologize in advance but it 's the best job in the world you know you find somebody
 who is respectable and has a lot of money you give them more money they repay you that over a time
  you collect interest and do nothing in between  so i thought  why don 't we get into that business so
 here we are having our first client 
 brilliant  first independent newspaper in slovakia the government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in bratislava  so here 's the daily newspaper that has to be
 printed four hundred kilometers away from the capital it
 's a daily newspaper with a deadline of four p m that means that they have no sports they have no latest news circulation goes down  
 it 's a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper 
 they come to us with a request for a loan they want to the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press  
 and we said that 's fine let 's meet you 'll bring us your business plan
 which eventually they did we start the meeting  i get these two pieces of paper not like this a4 format so it 's much bigger 
 a lot of numbers there a lot of numbers but however you put it you know the numbers do not make any sense  and that 's the best they could do 
 we were the best that they could do so that is how we understood what our method is it 's not a bank we had
  actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them by establishing management systems by providing all that knowledge how do you run a business on one 
  side while they all know how to run how to create content 
 just quickly on the results over these ten years  forty million dollars
 in affordable financing  average interest rate five percent to
 six percent  lately we are going wild charging seven percent from time to time
 we do it in seventeen countries of the developing world  and here is the most stunning number  return rate the one that soros
  percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time what do we typically finance we finance anything that a media company would need from printing presses to
 transmitters  what is most important is
 we do it either in form of loans  equities  lease whatever is appropriate for
  most important here is who do we finance  we believe that in the last ten years companies that we 've
 financed
 are actually the best media companies in the developing world 
 that is a who is who list  and i could spend hours talking about them
  because they 're all kind of
  and i can but i 'll give you just maybe one and depending on time i may give you two examples who we work with you
 see we started working in eastern and central europe and moved to russia 
 our first loan in russia was in chelyabinsk i 'll bet half of you have never heard of that place 
 in the south of russia there 's a guy called
 boris nikolayevich kirshin who is running an independent newspaper there the city was closed
  of all things they were producing glass for tupolev planes 
 anyway he 's running independent newspaper there 
 after two years working with us he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small
 place
 governor comes to him one day actually invites him to come to his office he goes and sees the governor the governor says  boris nikolayevich i understand you are doing a great job
  most respected newspaper in in our district  and
 i want to offer you a deal can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months  because i have elections there are elections
 coming up in nine months i will not run but it 's very important for me
 who is going to succeed me so give me the paper for nine months i 'll give it back to you i have no
  interest in being in media business how much would that cost  
 boris nikolayevich says it 's not for sale the governor says we will close you boris nikolayevich says no you cannot do it 
 six months later the newspaper was closed 
 luckily we had enough time to help boris nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and
 bring him into a new one to get all the subscription lists
 rehire staff so what the governor got was an empty shell  but
 that is what happens if you 're in business of independent media and if you are a banker
 for independent media so it
 sounds like a great story  somewhere down the road we opened a media management center we started our media lab sounds
  like a real great story  but there is a second second angle to that the second angle like in this clip if
 you take the camera above you start thinking about these numbers again  forty million dollars over ten years
 spread over seventeen countries that is not too much is it it 's actually just a drop in the sea
  because when you think about the importance some of the issues that we were talking about last night this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical fifty billion dollars
 destined for africa all of those not all half of those problems
 mentioned last night
 government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to unheard to poor
 it 's why independent media is in business
  's why it was invented  
 so from that perspective what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can we can
 identify  now
 ours is just one story i 'm sure that in this room there are like fifteen other wonderful stories
 of nonprofits doing spectacular work here is where the problem is
  to you
 as as well as i can
 what the problem is  and it 's called fundraising  imagine that this third of this room
 is filled with people who represent different foundations  imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations
  doing very important work  now imagine that every second person over here is deaf
  does not hear  and switch the lights off now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room
 with people of that side of the room so we thought
 that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink
  instead of people running in this dark trying to find their own match who will be willing who has the same goals instead of all of that we thought there is
 something new needs to be
 invented  and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds press freedom bonds if
 there are investors willing to finance u s 
  why wouldn 't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit
 we 've decided to do it this fall  we will issue them probably in denominations of one thousand dollars 
 i don 't want to advertise them too much that 's not the point but the point is if we ever survive to actually issue them 
 find enough investors that this can be
 considered a success there 's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next
  spring  and those can be environmental bonds  and then two weeks later  iqbal quadir can issue his
 electricity in bangladesh bonds  and before you know it  any social cause can be actually financed in this way  
 now we do daydreaming in eleven thirty
  seconds left but let 's take the idea further  
 you do it  you start it in the states because it 's you know concepts are very very close to american minds  but you can actually bring it to europe too 
 you can bring it to asia  
 you can 
 once you have all of those different points you can make it easy for investors put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click  
 once you have more than ten of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix what do investors get
  on one side financial on the other side social so that brings the idea of some kind of of
 rating agency 
 morningstar type it says you know social impact over here is spectacular five stars financial they give you one percent only one star  
 now take it to the last step once you have all of that put together
 there 's not one reason
 why you
 couldn 't actually have a marketplace for all of that 
 where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way and in that way you organize the financing
 so there are no dark rooms no blind people running around to find each other
