  like you to come back with me
 just for a few minutes to a dark night in china the night i met my husband it was a city so long ago that it was
  so i
 went to a party  i sat down next to a stout middle aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie  
 and he turned out to be a fulbright scholar there in china specifically to study  sino soviet relations 
 what a gift it was to the eager young foreign correspondent that i was then i 'd pump him for information
  for the stories i plan to write i talk to him for hours  only
 months later  i discover who he really was  
 he was the china representative for the american soybean association 
 i don 't understand soybeans  you told me you were a fulbright scholar
  you have talked to me if i told you we 're in soybeans
  we did 
 and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be 
 he was a chinese scholar who later
  a licensed pilot  he had once been a san francisco cable car operator  he was an expert in swine nutrition dairy cattle  dixieland jazz  film noir and we did travel the country  
 and the world 
 and we did have a lot of kids  we followed my job and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn 't do  
 so when we
 found the cancer it doesn 't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other  we believed
 that if we were smart enough
 and strong enough and brave enough and we worked hard enough  we could keep him from
  and for years it seemed like we were succeeding  
 the surgeon emerged from the surgery what 'd he say he said what surgeons always say we got it all 
 then there was a setback when the pathologists
 looked at the kidney cancer closely  it turned out to be a rare exceedingly aggressive type with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in
 in several weeks at most  and yet
 he did not die  mysteriously  he lived on 
 he coached little league for our son  
 he built a playhouse for our daughter
  and meanwhile i 'm burying myself in the internet looking for specialists  i 'm looking for a cure 
 so a year goes by
 before the cancer as cancers do
  and with it comes another death sentence this time nine months  
 so we try another treatment aggressive  nasty  it makes him so sick he has to quit it yet still he lives on 
 then another year goes by two years go by more specialists we take the kids to italy  we take the kids to australia 
 and then more years pass
 the cancer begins to grow 
 this time there 's new treatments on the horizon  they 're exotic they 're experimental 
 they 're going to attack the cancer in new ways  so he enters a clinical trial  
 and it works the cancer begins to shrink  and for the third time 
 we 've dodged
  now i ask you how do i feel
 when the time finally comes
 and there 's another dark night  sometime between midnight and two a m this time it 's on the intensive care ward
 when a twentysomething resident that i 've never met before
 tells me that terence is dying  perhaps tonight  so what do i say when he says
  what do you want me to do 
 there 's another drug out there it 's newer it 's more powerful he started it just two weeks ago  
 perhaps there 's still hope ahead  
 so what do i say i say keep him alive if you can 
 and terence died six days later  
 so we fought we struggled we triumphed
 it was an exhilarating fight and i 'd repeat the fight today without a moment 's hesitation 
 we fought together  we lived together  it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life
 into seven of the most glorious it was also an expensive fight
  was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end of life care and of healthcare for all of us  and
 for me for us  we pushed the fight right over the edge and i never got the chance to say to him
 what i say to him now almost every day hey buddy it was a hell of a ride we never got the chance to
  we never thought it was the end  we always had hope  
 so what
 do we make of all of this being a journalist  
 after terence died  i wrote a book the cost of hope i wrote it because i wanted to know why i did what i did  
 why he did what he did  
  why everyone around us did what they did and what did i discover well one of the things i discovered is that experts think that one answer to
 what i did at the end was a piece of paper  the advance directive 
 to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices yet
 i had that piece of paper  
 we both did  and they were readily available i had them right at hand  both of them said the same thing
  do nothing if there is no further hope 
 i knew terence 's wishes as clearly and as surely as i knew my own 
 yet
 we never got to no further hope even with that clear cut paper in our hands  we just kept redefining
  i could keep him
 from dying  
 and i 'd be embarrassed to say that if i hadn 't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way right up until days before his death  
 i felt strongly
 and powerfully and you might say
  could keep him from dying
 ever 
 now what do the experts call this 
 they say it 's denial it 's a strong word isn 't it 
 yet i will tell you that denial isn 't even close to a strong enough word
 to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through
 and i hear the medical professionals
  say well we 'd like to do such and such but the family 's in denial  
 the family won 't listen to reason they 're in denial  
 how can they insist on this treatment at the end it 's so clear yet they 're in denial now
 i think this maybe isn 't a very useful way of thinking it
 's not just families either the medical professionals too  you out there
 you 're in denial too  
 you want to help you want to fix  you want to do 
 you 've succeeded in everything you 've done  and having a patient die  
 well that must feel like failure  
 i saw it firsthand just days before terence died
  tell terence that better days are just ahead days before he died  yet ira byock the director of palliative medicine at dartmouth
 said you know  the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal 
 so what the experts call denial i call
  and i 'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design
  you just redefine denial and hope  and it becomes a feature of being human  it 's not a bug  
 it 's a feature 
 laughter so we need to think more constructively about
  it 's part of the human condition and yet our system and our thinking isn 't built to accommodate it 
 so terence told me a story on that long ago night and i believed it maybe i wanted to believe it 
 and during terence 's
  to believe the story of our fight together too  giving up the fight for that 's how it felt it felt like giving up meant
 giving up not only his life but
 also our story our story of us as fighters  the story of us as invincible  
 and for the doctors the story of themselves as healers
  so what do we need 
 maybe we don 't need a new piece of paper  maybe we need a new story 
 not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness 
 but rather a story of victory and triumph 
 of a valiant battle
  a graceful retreat a story that acknowledges
 that not even the greatest general defeats every foe that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal  
 and that
 no wife no matter how hard she tried has ever
  and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go 
 people did mention hospice but i wouldn 't listen 
 hospice was for people who were dying and
 terence wasn 't dying as a result he spent just four days in hospice which i 'm sure as you all know is a pretty typical outcome
 and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end
  we have a noble path to curing the disease  patients and doctors alike  
 but there doesn 't seem to be a noble path to dying 
 dying is seen as failing  and we had a heroic narrative
 for fighting together
  heroic narrative for letting go so
 maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end and for saying goodbye  
 and maybe our new story will be about a hero 's fight and a hero 's goodbye terence loved
  is one of my favorite poets  so i 'll give you a couple lines from him this is a poem about mark antony  you know mark antony the
 conquering hero cleopatra 's guy  actually one of cleopatra 's guys  and
 he 's been a pretty good general he 's won all the fights he 's eluded all the people that are out to get him  
  yet this time finally he 's come to the city of alexandria and realized he 's lost the people are leaving they 're playing instruments they 're singing  and suddenly he knows he 's been defeated  
 and he suddenly knows he 's been deserted by the gods  and it 's time to let go and
 the poet tells him what to do  he tells him how to say a noble goodbye a goodbye that 's fit for
  becomes you who were worthy of such a city approach the window with a firm step  and with emotion  
 but not with the entreaties
 or the complaints of a coward as a last enjoyment listen to the sounds
  exquisite instruments of the musical troops and bid her farewell the alexandria you are losing 
 that 's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life 
 a goodbye for a man for whom anything  
 well  almost anything was possible 
 a goodbye for a man who kept
  and isn 't that what we 're missing how can we learn that people 's decisions about their loved ones
 are often based strongly powerfully many times irrationally on the slimmest of hopes  
 the overwhelming presence of hope
 isn 't denial  it 's part of our dna as humans  and maybe it 's time our healthcare system doctors
 started accounting for the power of that hope hope isn 't a bug  it 's a feature
