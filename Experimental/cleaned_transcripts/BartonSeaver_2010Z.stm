  sustainability represents the what the where and the how of what is caught 
 the who and the why are what 's important to me  i want to know the people behind my dinner choices  i want to know how i impact them i want to know how they impact me  
 i want to know why they fish i want to know how they rely on the water
  's bounty for their living understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity
 to an opportunity
 to restore our ecosystem 
 it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we 're also so fortunate to eat so what do we call this i think we call it restorative seafood 
 where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain
 restorative is the ability to replenish and progress restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency  
 it is a more hopeful it is a more human and is a more useful way of understanding our environment
  wallet guides
 standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world are very handy they 're a wonderful tool 
 green yellow and red lists [ of ] seafood species  the association is very easy  buy green don 't buy red think twice about yellow  
 but in my mind it 's really not enough to just eat green list  we can 't sustain this without the measure of our
  changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red but what if we eat only in the green list you 've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here
 comes from sustainable stocks pole caught no bycatch great for fishermen lots of money supporting local economies  
 but it 's a lion of the sea it 's a top predator
 what 's the context of this meal am i sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16 ounce portion of this do i do this three times a week
 i might still be in the green list but i 'm not
  doing myself or you or the oceans any favors the
 point is that we have to have a context a gauge for our actions in all this example  i 've heard that red wine is is great for my health
 antioxidants and minerals heart healthy that 's great i love red wine i 'm going to drink so much of it i 'm going to be so healthy  
 well how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem 
  have a protein problem  we have lost this sensibility when it regards our food and we are paying a cost 
 the problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves we are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines 
 and we are hiding that cost behind monster profits 
 so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs restorative seafood might best be represented
  not by jaws or by flipper or the gordon 's fisherman but rather by the jolly green giant
  vegetables  they might yet save the oceans  sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green well i 'd
 like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue 
 we must continue to eat the best seafood
 seafood possible if at all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables
 the best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of tabasco and lemon wedges it comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard and crispy broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of
 pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake whooo 
 this is an easy sell and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every
  family at the neighborhood walmart  jamie oliver
 is campaigning to save america from the way we eat  sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans
 from the way we eat there 's a pattern here 
 forget nuclear holocaust it 's the fork that we have to worry about we have ravaged our earth and then used the food that we 've sourced to
  handicap ourselves in more ways than one 
 so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong  and so i think it 's time we change what we expect from our food 
 sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand so let 's start there 
 there 's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems dan barber and alice waters are leading passionately the green food delicious revolution
 but green foods often represent
 a way for us to to disregard the responsibility as eaters just because it comes from a green source doesn 't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate  
 we have eco friendly shrimp we can make them we have that technology  but we can never have any 
  shrimp buffet  
  dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood 
 while we try to manage declining marine populations the media 's recommending increased consumption of seafood 
 studies say that tens of thousands of american grandmothers grandfathers mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood 
 that 's a reward i am not willing to pass up 
 but it 's not all about the seafood it 's about the way that we look at our plates 
 as a chef
  i realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate a couple things happened  i made more money  
 people started buying appetizers and salads because they knew they weren 't going to fill up on the entrees alone 
 people spent more time engaging in their meals engaging with each other over their meals people got in short more of what
 came there for even though they got less protein they got more calories over the course of a diversified meal  they got healthier  i made more money this is great 
 environmental consideration was served with every plate  but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time 
 one of the other things we did was begin to
 diversify the species that we served small
  were directing tastes towards more resilience more restorative options 
 this is what we need to favor this is what the green list says  but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment  
 but what of those big predators those fashionable species that
 green list tuna that i was talking about earlier  well if you must i have a recipe for you
 it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean so here we go start with a 16 ounce portion of
 big fish 
 get a knife 
 cut it into four portions  
 put it on four plates mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of burgundy you have light the candles and celebrate it 
 celebrate the
  opportunity you have to eat this invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year  maybe  
 i expect a lot from food i expect health and joy and family and community  
 i expect that producing ingredients preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests 
 i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook and he taught me very early on about the privilege
 that eating represents i remember well
  the meals of my childhood they were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch usually rice this is still how i largely eat today  
 i get sick
 when i go to steakhouses i get the meat sweats  it 's like a hangover from protein it 's disgusting
 but of all the dire news that you 'll hear and that you have heard about the state of
  oceans i have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it
 and that is this whole time
 your mother was right eat your vegetables  it 's pretty straightforward 
 so what are we looking for in a meal  well for health i 'm looking for wholesome ingredients that that are good for my body
  looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance for family  i 'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories 
 for community though we start at the very beginning 
 there 's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step
 to minimize it we 've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank  but it is more than just a repository
  of our resources  it 's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner 
 so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore 
 we need to savor vegetables  we need to savor smaller portions of seafood and we need to save dinner thank you
