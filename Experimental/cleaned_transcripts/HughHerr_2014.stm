  looking deeply inside nature  through the magnifying glass of science  designers extract principles processes and materials
 that are forming the very basis of design
  synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials 
 to computational methods that emulate neural processes nature is driving design 
 design is also driving nature  
 in realms of genetics regenerative medicine and synthetic biology  designers are growing novel technologies not foreseen or
  the interplay between biology and design as you can see my legs are bionic  
 today i will tell human stories
 of bionic integration how 
 attached to the body  and implanted inside the body
 are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability between
 human limitation
 and human potential bionics has defined my physicality 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite incurred during a mountain climbing accident at
 that time i didn 't view my body as broken  
 i reasoned that a human being
 can never be
 technology is broken technology is inadequate  
 this simple but powerful idea was a call to arms  to advance technology
 for the elimination of my own disability and ultimately the disability of others  
 i began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world
  of rock and ice climbing i quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable able to take on any form  any function
 a blank slate
 for which to create  perhaps structures that could extend beyond biological capability  
 i made my height adjustable i could be as short as five feet or as tall as i 'd like
  so when i was feeling
 bad about myself  insecure i would jack my height up 
 but when i was feeling confident and suave i would knock my height down a notch just to give the competition a chance 
 applause narrow edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures where the human foot cannot penetrate and spiked
 enabled me to climb vertical ice walls without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue  
 through technological innovation  i returned to my sport stronger and better technology had eliminated my disability 
 and allowed me a new climbing prowess as a young man i imagined a future world where technology
 so advanced could rid the world of disability a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see 
 a world in which the paralyzed could walk via body exoskeletons  
 sadly because of deficiencies in technology disability is rampant in the world this gentleman is missing three limbs 
 as a testimony to current technology  he is out of the wheelchair but we need to do a better job in bionics 
 to allow one day full rehabilitation for
  a person with this level of injury at the mit media lab we 've established the center for extreme bionics the mission of the center
 is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans across a broad range
  'm going to tell you how my legs function how they work as a
 case in point for this center now i made sure to shave my legs last night because i knew i 'd be showing them off 
 bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces there 's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs mechanical how my limbs are attached to my
  how they move like flesh and bone  and electrical how they communicate with my nervous system i 'll begin with mechanical interface  
 in the area of design we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically  
 it 's extraordinary to me that in this day and age one of the most mature oldest technologies in the human timeline the
  us blisters how can this be we have no idea how to attach things to our bodies  this is the beautifully
 lyrical design work of professor neri oxman at the mit media lab showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances shown here by color variation in this 
 model imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it when you need it for optimal support and flexibility
  without ever causing discomfort 
 my bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations 
 that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics  
 to achieve that mirroring we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb to that end we used imaging tools such as mri  to look inside my body to figure out the
  geometries and locations of various tissues we also took robotic tools here 's a 
 circle that goes around the biological limb  
 the actuators come in find the surface of the limb measure its unloaded shape 
 and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point 
 we combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my
  biological limb shown on the left you see a bunch of points or nodes at each node there 's a color that represents tissue compliance we then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin shown on the right  
 and we 've discovered optimality is where the body is stiff the synthetic skin should be soft where the body
 is soft the synthetic skin is stiff and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances with
  this framework we 've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs i 've ever worn  clearly in the future 
 our clothing our shoes our braces our prostheses will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies but rather data driven quantitative frameworks in that future
  our shoes will no longer give us blisters  
 we 're also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins this is a material developed by sri international  california 
 under electrostatic effect it changes stiffness  so under zero voltage  the material is compliant it 's floppy like paper then the button 's pushed a voltage is applied and it becomes stiff as a board
  into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body 
 when i walk here it 's no voltage my interface is soft and compliant the button 's pushed voltage is applied and it stiffens offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb we
 're also building exoskeletons this exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle to protect the biological
  joints from high impacts and degradation  in the future we 'll all be wearing exoskeletons in common activities such as running  
 next  dynamic interface how do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone 
 at my mit lab we study how humans with normal physiologies stand walk and run  what are the muscles
  and how are they controlled by the spinal cord 
 this basic science motivates what we build we 're building bionic ankles knees and hips we 're building body parts from the ground up 
 the bionic limbs that i 'm wearing
 are called bioms they 've been fitted to nearly one thousand patients  
 four hundred of which have been wounded u s soldiers how does it work at heel strike under computer control
  the system controls stiffness to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground then at mid stance the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person 
  into the walking stride comparable to how muscles work in the calf region 
  something
 everyone should be able to do go up and down their steps at home 
 bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats here 's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway 
 this is steve martin not the comedian
 who lost his legs in a bomb blast in afghanistan we 're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles that wrap around
  the biological limb  this gentleman does not have
 any leg condition any disability  he has a normal physiology  so these exoskeletons are applying
  and powers  so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers  
 this is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking it
  significantly reduces metabolic cost  it 's so profound in its augmentation 
 that when a normal healthy person wears the device for forty minutes and then takes it off 
 their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward  
 we 're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and
 faster and more efficient 
 moving on to electrical interface how do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system 
 across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles that 's communicated to the bionic limb  so when i think about moving my phantom limb  
 the robot tracks those movement desires  
 this diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled
  so we model the missing biological limb  and we 've discovered what reflexes
 occurred how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles and that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb  
 what we 've done then is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex  the modeled spinal reflex with the neural signal  
 so when i relax my muscles
 in my
  i get very little torque and power but the more i fire my muscles the more torque i get and i can even run  
 and that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command
  feels great 
 we want to go a step further we want to actually close the loop
 between the human and the bionic external limb we 're doing
  experiments where we 're growing nerves transected nerves  through channels or micro channel arrays on the other side of the channel 
 the nerve then attaches to cells skin cells and muscle cells 
 in the motor channels we can sense how the person wishes to move that can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb  
 then [ sensory information ] on the bionic limb
 can be converted to
  channels  sensory channels  so when this is fully developed and for human use  
 persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like
 flesh and bone  but actually feel like flesh and bone  this video shows lisa  mallette shortly after being fitted with
  bionics is making a profound difference in people 's lives
  next week i 'm visiting the center for medicare and medicaid services
  and i 'm going to try to convince cms to grant appropriate code language and pricing so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it thank you 
 it 's not well appreciated but over half of the world 's population suffers from some form
  sensory or motor condition and because of poor technology too often conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life 
 basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights  every person should have the right
 to live life without disability if they so choose
 the right to live life without severe depression the right to see a loved
  the right to walk or to dance  in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation 
 as a society we can achieve these human rights  if we accept the proposition
 that humans
 are not disabled 
 a person can never be broken  our built environment our technologies are broken and disabled
  we the people need not accept our limitations 
 but can transcend disability through technological innovation  indeed through fundamental advances in bionics in this century 
 we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience  and we will end disability i 'd
 like to finish up with one more story a beautiful story  the story of
  adrianne lost her left leg in the boston terrorist attack
  met adrianne when this photo was taken at spaulding rehabilitation hospital adrianne is a dancer a ballroom dancer adrianne breathes and lives dance  
 it is her expression it is her art form naturally 
 when she lost her limb in the boston terrorist attack  she wanted to return to the dance floor  
 after meeting her and driving home in my car i thought  i 'm an mit professor i have resources
  's build her a bionic limb to enable her to go back to her life of dance i
 brought in mit scientists with expertise in prosthetics robotics machine learning and biomechanics  and over a 200 day research period we studied dance  
 we brought in dancers with biological limbs  
 and we studied how they move 
 what forces they apply on the dance floor
 and we took those data  and we put forth fundamental principles of dance reflexive dance capability and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb  
 bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster our expression our humanity
 can be embedded into electromechanics
  it was three point five seconds
 between the bomb blasts in the boston terrorist attack  in three point five seconds the criminals and cowards
 took adrianne off the dance floor  
 in two hundred days we put her back we will not be intimidated brought down diminished conquered or stopped by acts of violence
  her first performance since the attack  she 's dancing with christian lightner
  elliott and nathan
