  please think of your biggest personal goal 
 for real you can take a second you 've got to feel this to learn it take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal  okay  
 imagine deciding right now that you 're going to do it imagine telling someone that you meet today what you 're going to do
  imagine their congratulations and their high image of you doesn
 't it feel good to say it out loud don 't you feel one step closer already like it 's already becoming part of your identity
  well bad news you should have kept your mouth shut because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it 
 the repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen
 any time you have a goal  there are some steps that need to be done some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it 
 ideally you would not be satisfied until you 'd actually done the work 
 but when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it psychologists have found that it 's called a social reality the mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it 's already done 
 and then because you 've felt that satisfaction you 're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary
 so this goes against conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals right so they hold us to it  
 so  let 's look at the proof one thousand nine hundred and twenty six kurt lewin founder of social psychology called this substitution 
  mahler found when it was acknowledged by others it felt real in the mind one thousand nine hundred
  peter gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in two thousand and nine he did some new tests that were published it goes like this
 one hundred and  sixty three people across four separate tests 
 everyone wrote down their personal goal  then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room and half didn 't 
 then everyone was given forty five minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal  but they were told that they could stop at any time 
 now those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire
 on average and when asked afterward  said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal  
 but those who had announced it quit after only thirty three minutes on average 
 and when asked afterward  said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal  so if this is true what can we do 
 well you could resist the temptation to announce your goal you can delay the gratification
  that the social acknowledgment brings and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing 
 but if you do need to talk about something you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction  
 such as i really want to run this marathon so i need to train five times a week and kick my ass if i don 't  okay 
 so audience next time you 're tempted to tell someone your goal  what will you say
