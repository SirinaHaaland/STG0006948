  every weekend for as long as i can remember 
 my father would get up on a saturday  put on a worn sweatshirt and he 'd
 scrape away at the squeaky old wheel of a house that we lived in 
 i wouldn 't even call it restoration it was a
  ritual  catharsis 
 he would spend all year scraping paint with this old heat gun and a spackle knife  and then he would repaint where he scraped only to begin again the following year 
 scraping and  re scraping painting and repainting  
 the work of an old house is never meant to be done 
  i got a phone call my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer  she told me 
 and he had been given only three weeks to live  
 i immediately moved home to poughkeepsie new york 
 to sit with my father on death watch not knowing what the next days would bring us to
 keep myself distracted i
  i rolled up my sleeves  and i went about finishing what he could now no longer complete
 the restoration of our old home when that looming three week deadline came
 and then went he was still alive  and at three months  he joined me  
 we gutted and repainted the interior at six months  the old windows were refinished  and at eighteen months
  the rotted porch was finally replaced  
 and there was my father standing with me outside  admiring a day 's work hair on his head  fully in remission 
 when he turned to me and he said you know michael this house saved my life 
 so the following year  i decided to go to architecture school 
  but there i learned something different about buildings recognition seemed to come to those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms like
 ribbons  or  pickles 
 and i think this is supposed to be a snail  
 something about this bothered me  why was it that the best architects the greatest architecture all beautiful and visionary and innovative
 is also so rare and seems to serve so very few 
 and more to the point with all of this creative talent what more could we do 
 just as i was about to start my final exams i decided to take a break from an all nighter and go to a lecture
  paul farmer 
 a leading health activist for the global poor 
 i was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture 
 buildings are making people sicker  he said  and for the poorest in the world  this is causing epidemic level problems 
 in this hospital in south africa patients that came in with say a broken leg to wait in this unventilated hallway walked out with
  control had not been thought about and people had died
 because of it 
 where are the architects paul said if hospitals are making people sicker  where are the architects and designers to help us
 build and design hospitals that allow us to heal 
 that following
  i was in the back of a land rover with a few classmates bumping over the mountainous hillside of rwanda 
 for the next year i 'd be living in butaro in this old guesthouse which was a jail after the genocide 
 i was there to design and build a new type of hospital with dr farmer and his team 
 if hallways are making patients sicker  
  what if we could design a hospital that flips the hallways on the outside and makes people walk in the exterior 
 if mechanical systems rarely work what if we could design a hospital that could breathe through natural ventilation 
 and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint  
 and what about the patients ' experience  evidence shows that a simple view of nature can radically improve health outcomes 
 so why couldn 't we design a hospital where every patient had a window with a view 
 simple
 site specific designs can make a hospital that heals  designing it is one thing  getting it built we learned is quite another  
 we worked with bruce nizeye a brilliant engineer  and he thought about construction differently than i had been taught in school  
 when we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site  bruce suggested doing
  it by hand  using a method in rwanda called ubudehe which means community works for the community 
 hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes  
 and we excavated that hill in half the time
 and half the cost of that bulldozer  instead of importing furniture bruce started a guild  and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand
  and on this job site  fifteen years after the rwandan genocide  
 bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds  and that half of them be women 
 bruce was using the process of building to heal not just for those who were sick  but for the entire community
 as a whole we call this the locally fabricated way of building or
 and it has
 four pillars  
 hire locally source regionally train where you can and most importantly think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve 
 think of it like the local food
  but for architecture 
 and we 're convinced that this way of building can be replicated across the world  and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture  
 using the lo fab way of building even aesthetic decisions can be designed to impact people 's lives 
 in butaro we chose to use a local volcanic stone found in abundance within the area but often considered a nuisance by
  and piled on the side of the road  we worked with these masons to cut these stones and form them
 into the walls of the hospital and when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital 
 they were so good at putting these stones together they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it 
 and you see what is possible 
 it 's beautiful 
 and the beauty to me  comes from the fact that i know that hands cut
  these stones and they formed them into this thick wall made only in this place with rocks from this soil 
 when you go outside today and you look at your built world  
 ask not only what is the environmental footprint an important question but what if we also asked what is the human handprint
 of those who made it
  we started a new practice based around these questions  and we tested it
 around the world  
 like in haiti  where we asked if a new hospital could help end the epidemic of cholera 
 in this 100 bed hospital  we designed a simple strategy to clean contaminated medical waste before it
  enters the water table and our partners at les centres  gheskio are already saving lives because of it 
 or malawi we asked if a birthing center could radically reduce maternal and infant mortality 
 malawi has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant death in the world  
 using a simple strategy to be replicated nationally  we designed a birthing center that would attract women and their attendants
  to come to the hospital earlier
 and therefore have safer births or in the congo  where we asked if an educational center could also be used to protect
 endangered wildlife poaching for ivory and bushmeat is leading to global epidemic disease transfer and war in one of the hardest to reach places in the world  
 we used the mud and the dirt and the wood around us to construct a center that would show us ways to protect and conserve our rich biodiversity 
  the us  we were asked to rethink the largest university for the deaf and hard of hearing in the world 
 the deaf community through sign language shows us the power of visual communication  we designed a campus that would awaken the ways in which we as humans all communicate  both verbally and nonverbally  
  we thought about old industrial infrastructure  we wondered could we use arts and culture and design
 to revitalize this city and other rust belt cities across our nation and turn them into centers for innovation and growth 
 in each of these projects we asked a simple question what more can architecture do and by
  were forced to consider
 how we could create jobs how we could source regionally
 and how we could invest in the dignity of the communities in which we serve  i have learned
 that architecture can be a transformative engine for change 
 about a year ago  i read an article about a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader
  named bryan stevenson 
 and bryan had a bold architectural vision 
 he and his team had been documenting
 the over four thousand lynchings of 
 that have happened in the american south  and they had a plan to mark every county
 where these lynchings occurred  and build a national memorial to the victims of lynching in montgomery  alabama  
 countries like germany and south africa
 and of course rwanda have found it necessary to build memorials to reflect on the atrocities of their past in order to heal
  i think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in america and could change the way we think about racial injustice by
 any chance do you know who will design it
  surprisingly shockingly 
 bryan got right back to me and invited me down to meet with his team and talk to them  
 needless to say i canceled all my meetings and i jumped on a plane to montgomery  alabama  when i got there 
 bryan and his team picked me up and we walked around the city and they took the time to point out
 the many markers that have been placed all over the city to the history of
  the confederacy and the very few
 that mark the history of slavery  and then he walked me to a hill it overlooked the whole city
 he pointed out the river and the train tracks where the largest domestic  slave trading port in america had once prospered  
 and then to the capitol rotunda where george wallace had stood on its steps and
  and then to the very hill below us he said here we will build a new memorial that will change the identity
 of this city and of this nation our two teams have worked together over the last year
 to design this memorial 
 the memorial will take us on a journey
  almost familiar building type like the parthenon or the colonnade
 at the vatican 
 but as we enter the ground drops below us and our perception shifts 
 where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings which happened in the public square  
 and as we continue  we begin to understand the vast number of those who have yet to be put to rest their names will be
  engraved on the markers that hang above us and just outside
 will be a field of identical columns  
 but these are temporary columns  waiting in purgatory to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred 
 over the next few years
  this site will bear witness as each of these markers is claimed and visibly placed in those counties 
 our nation will begin to heal from over a century of silence 
 when we think about how it should be built  we were reminded of ubudehe the building process we learned about in rwanda  
 we wondered if we could fill those very columns with the soil from the sites of where these killings occurred
 brian and his team have begun collecting that soil
 and preserving it in individual jars
 with family members community leaders and descendants  the act of collecting soil itself
 has lead to a type of spiritual healing it 's an act
  team member noted in the collection of the soil from where will mcbride was lynched 
 if will mcbride left one drop of sweat one drop of blood one hair follicle
 i pray that i dug it up  and that his whole body would be at peace 
 we plan to break ground on this memorial later this year and it will be a place to finally speak
 of the unspeakable acts that have scarred this nation when
  my father told me that day that this house our house had saved his life  
 was that he was referring to a much deeper relationship between architecture and ourselves  
 buildings are not simply expressive sculptures they make visible our personal and our collective aspirations as a society  
 great architecture can give us hope  great architecture can heal  
 thank you very much
