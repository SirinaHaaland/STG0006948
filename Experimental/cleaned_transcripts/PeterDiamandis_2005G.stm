  my mission in life since i was a kid
 was and is to take the rest of you into space it 's during our lifetime that we 're going to take the earth 
 take the people of earth and transition off permanently  and that 's exciting in fact i think it is a moral imperative that we open the space
  frontier you know it 's the first time that we 're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy a chance to if you would back up the biosphere  and
 if you think about space  everything we hold of value on this planet metals and minerals and real estate and energy
 is in infinite quantities in space in fact the earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources the analogy for me is alaska
 you know we bought alaska  we americans bought alaska in the 1850s it 's called seward 's folly
 we valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill  and then we discovered these things gold and oil and fishing and timber and it became you know 
 a trillion dollar economy and now we take our honeymoons there  the same thing will happen in space we are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known
  explore for three reasons  the weakest of which is curiosity  you know  it 's funded nasa 's budget up until now some images from mars 
 in fact i think in the next decade without any question we will discover life on mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet  
 the stronger
 stronger motivator the much stronger motivator is fear it drove us to the moon we literally in fear with the soviet union raced to the moon 
 and we have these huge rocks you know
 rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there and while the probability is very small the impact figured in literally of one of these hitting the earth is so huge 
 that to spend a small fraction looking searching preparing to defend is not unreasonable  and of course the third motivator  one near and
  dear to my heart as an entrepreneur is wealth 
 in fact the greatest wealth if you think about these other asteroids 
 there 's a class of the nickel iron  which in platinum group metal markets alone are worth something like twenty trillion dollars if you can go out and grab one of these rocks my plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market  and then actually claim that i 'm going to go out and
  that will fund the actual mission to go and get one but
 fear curiosity and greed have driven us and for me this is i 'm the short kid on the right
  this was my motivation was actually during apollo and apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever if you think about what happened
 at the turn of
 may twenty five jfk said we 're going to go to the
  and people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and
 be part of this amazing mission and we knew nothing about going to space we went from having literally put alan shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years and the average age of the people that got us there was 
 years old they didn 't know what couldn 't be done they had to make up everything  and that my friend
  this is gene cernan a good friend of mine saying if i can go to the moon this is the last human on the moon so far nothing nothing is impossible 
 but of course  we 've thought about the government always as the person taking us there  
 but i put forward here the government is not going to get us there  the government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier  the shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch that 's a pathetic number it 's unreasonable  we shouldn 't be happy in
  standing for that 
 one of the things that we did with the ansari x prize was take the challenge on that risk is ok  
 you know as we are going out there and taking on a new frontier  we should be allowed to risk in fact anyone who says we shouldn 't 
 you know  just needs to be put aside  because as we go forward 
 in fact the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us
  in the space business are the furry mammals and clearly the  industrial military complex with boeing and lockheed
 and nasa are the dinosaurs the ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy we can now gather all the information the genetic codes  
 you know everything stored on our databases and back them up off the planet
  in case there would be one of those disastrous situations the difficulty is getting there 
 and clearly the cost to orbit is key once you 're in orbit you are two thirds of the way energetically to anywhere the moon to mars 
 and today there 's only three vehicles the u s shuttle 
 the russian soyuz and the chinese vehicle that gets you there
  arguably it 's about one hundred million dollars a person
  one of the companies i started space adventures will sell you a ticket  we 've done two so far we 'll be announcing two more
 on the soyuz to go up to the space station for twenty million dollars  but that 's expensive and to understand what the potential is
 it is expensive but people are willing to pay that you know 
 one we have a very unique period in time today for the first time ever we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow
 us to really drive space exploration but how cheap could it get i
 want to give you the end point we know twenty million dollars today you can go and buy a ticket but how cheap could it get let 's go back to high school physics here  if you calculate the amount of potential energy  mgh to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles  
 and then you accelerate yourself to seventeen thousand five hundred miles per hour remember that one half mv squared
 and you figure it out it 's about five point seven gigajoules of
 energy  if you expended that over
 an hour it 's about one point six megawatts  if you go to one of vijay 's micro power sources and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour
 anybody here fast in math how much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit
  hundred bucks that 's the price improvement curve that we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way i 'll grant you that 
 laughter but guys
 if history has taught us anything  it 's that if you can imagine it you will get there eventually i have no question that the physics the engineering to get 
  us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner  
 that
 there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment today  the boeings and the lockheeds don 't spend a dollar of their own money in r & d 
 it 's all government research dollars and very few of those and in fact  the large corporations the governments can 't take the risk  
 so we need what i call an exothermic economic reaction in
  today 's commercial markets worldwide global commercial launch market  
 twelve to fifteen launches per year number of commercial companies out there  twelve to fifteen companies one per company that 's not it there 's only one marketplace and i call them self loading carbon payloads 
 they come with their own money  
 they 're easy to make it 's people the ansari x prize was my
 solution  reading about lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there  we offered ten million dollars in cash for the
  first reusable ship  carry three people up to one hundred kilometers come back down and within two weeks make the trip again twenty six teams from seven countries
 entered the competition  spending between one to twenty five million dollars each and of course we had beautiful spaceshipone which made those two flights
 and won the competition and i 'd like to take you
  that morning for just a quick video
  ansari x prize competition  i declare that mojave aerospace ventures has indeed earned the ansari x
 prize peter diamandis probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this it was literally impossible we went i went to one
  people are going to die how can you possibly going to put this forward 
 i found a visionary family the ansari family and champ car  and raised part of the money but not the full ten million and what i ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole in one insurance policy see
 the insurance companies went to boeing and lockheed and said
 of ' five and i took a bet that someone would win 
 so and the best thing is they paid off and and the check didn 't bounce 
 laughter we 've had a lot of accomplishments and it 's been a tremendous success one of the things i 'm most happy
  about is that the spaceshipone is going to hang in air and space museum  next to the spirit of st louis and the wright flyer isn 't that great 
 so a little bit about the future
  steps to space what 's available for you today you can go and experience weightless flights 
 by ' eight suborbital flights the price tag for that you know on virgin is going to be about two hundred thousand there are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly
 twenty five thousand dollars for a suborbital flight orbital flights we can take you to the space station and then i truly believe once a group is in orbit around the earth
 i know if they don 't do it i am we 're going to stockpile some fuel make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate 
 laughter quick moment for the designers in the audience we spent eleven years getting faa approval to do zero gravity flights here are some fun
  images here 's burt rutan and my good friend greg meronek inside a zero gravity
 people think a zero gravity room there 's a switch on there that turns it off but it 's actually parabolic flight of an airplane  and
 turns out 7 up has just done a little commercial that 's airing this month if we can get the audio up
 when you want the taste that won 't weigh you down the only way to go is up pd that was filmed inside our airplane  and
 so you can now do this we 're based down in florida  
 let me talk about the other thing i 'm excited about the future of prizes you know prizes are a very old idea i had the pleasure of borrowing from the longitude prize and the orteig prize that put lindbergh forward and we have
  made a decision in the x prize foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas and we just took on a new mission statement 
 to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity and this is something that we 're very excited about
  i showed this slide to larry page who just joined our board
  when you give to a nonprofit you might have fifty cents on the dollar if you have a matching grant it 's typically two or three to one if you put up a prize  
 you can get literally a fifty to one leverage on your dollars and that 's huge and then he turned around and said well if you back a prize institute that runs a ten prize you get five hundred to one i said well that 
  's great so we have actually are looking to turn the x prize into a world class prize institute 
  teams start to begin
 doing trials  you get publicity increase and when it 's won publicity shoots through the roof if it 's properly managed and that 's part of the benefits to a sponsor 
 then when the prize is actually won after it it 's moving you get societal benefits  you know  new technology new capability
  and the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term that 's our value proposition in a prize  
 if you were going to go and try to create spaceshipone or any kind of a new technology you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome it may or may not happen 
 but if you put up a prize the beautiful thing is you know it 's
 a very small maintenance fee and you pay on success
  orteig didn 't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across tried to go across the atlantic and we didn 't pay a dime until someone won the ansari x prize so prizes work great  
 you know  innovators the entrepreneurs out there you know that when you 're going for a goal the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself 
 then you 've got to you know face potential public ridicule of that 's a crazy idea it 'll never work  and then you have to convince others  so that
  they can in fact help you raise the funds  and then you 've got to deal with the fact that you 've got government bureaucracies and institutions that don 't want you to move
 those things forward and you have to deal with failures what a prize does what we 've experienced a prize doing is literally help to  short circuit
 or support all of these things because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea  well  it must be a good idea someone 's offering ten million dollars to go and do this thing 
 and each of these areas was something that we found the ansari x prize
  helped short circuit these for innovation so as an organization we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules 
 and we 're actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories we 're looking at attacking energy  environment nanotechnology and i
 'll talk about those more
  and the way we 're doing that is we 're creating prize teams within the x prize we have a space prize team we
 're going after an orbital prize we are looking at a number of energy prizes  
 craig venter has just joined our board and we 're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him we 'll be announcing
 later this fall about imagine being able to
 to sequence anybody 's dna for under one thousand dollars revolutionize medicine and clean
  medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship  
 so my final slide here is the most critical tool for solving humanity 's grand challenges it isn 't technology it isn 't money it 's only one thing it 's the committed passionate human mind
