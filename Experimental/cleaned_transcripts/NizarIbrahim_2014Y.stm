  they 're beautiful  and there 's very little we know about them 
 these thoughts were going through my head when i looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book
  i was about five years old at the time 
 and i decided there and then that i would become a paleontologist  
 paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far flung corners of the world 
 and now a few years later i 've led several expeditions to the ultimate
  on this planet the sahara i 've worked in the sahara because i 've been on a quest to uncover new remains
 of a bizarre giant predatory dinosaur called spinosaurus a few bones of this animal have been found
 in the deserts of egypt and were described about one hundred years ago by a german
  bones were destroyed in world war ii so all we 're left with
 are just a few drawings and notes 
 from these drawings we know that this creature  which lived about one hundred million years ago 
 was very big it had tall spines on its back forming a magnificent sail  
 and it had long slender jaws a bit like a crocodile
  that may have been used to catch slippery prey like fish  but that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next one hundred years 
 my fieldwork took me to the border region between morocco and algeria 
 a place called the kem kem it 's a difficult place to work in you have to deal with sandstorms and snakes
  and scorpions  
 and it 's very difficult to find good fossils there but our hard work paid off  
 we discovered many incredible specimens there 's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the sahara  
 we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs medium sized predatory
  these fossils were deposited in a river system the river system was also home to a giant car sized coelacanth 
 a monster sawfish and the skies over the river system were filled
 with pterosaurs  flying reptiles it was a pretty dangerous place not the kind of place where you 'd want to travel to if you had a time machine
  so we 're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside spinosaurus 
 but spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive we were just finding bits and pieces and i was hoping that we 'd find a partial skeleton at some point 
 finally very recently we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of
  we returned to the site we collected more bones and so after one hundred years we finally had another partial skeleton
 of this bizarre creature 
 and we were able to reconstruct it we now know that spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile 
 very different from other predatory dinosaurs very different from the t rex  
 but the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton  
 spines the spines forming the big sail  we had leg bones  we had skull bones
 feet wide feet again very unusual no other dinosaur has feet like this
 and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment or maybe for paddling in the water  
 we also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone the inside structure of spinosaurus bones and it turns out that they 're very dense
  and compact again this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water  it 's useful for buoyancy control in the water  
 we  c t scanned all of our bones and built a digital spinosaurus skeleton  
 and when we looked at the digital skeleton  we realized that yes this was a dinosaur unlike any other it
  written all over it but really the entire skeleton has water loving written all over it dense bone
 paddle like feet  and the hind limbs are reduced in size and again this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water  
 so as we fleshed out our spinosaurus i 'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin we realize that we 're dealing with a river monster
  monster a predatory dinosaur bigger than t rex the ruler of this ancient river of giants  feeding on the many aquatic animals i showed you earlier on 
 so that 's really what makes this an incredible discovery it 's a dinosaur like no other  and some people told me wow this is
 a once in a lifetime discovery there are not many things left to discover in the
  i think nothing could be further from the truth  
 i think the sahara 's still full of treasures  and when people tell me there are no places left to explore i like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter roy chapman andrews 
 and he said 
 always  there has been an adventure just around the corner
 and the world is still full of corners that was true many decades ago when roy chapman andrews wrote these lines  and it is still true today  thank you
