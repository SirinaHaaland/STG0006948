  type is something we consume in enormous quantities in much of the world it 's completely inescapable  but few consumers are concerned to know
 where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it if indeed there was any human agency involved
  involved
 in its creation if it didn 't just sort of materialize out of the software ether  
 but i do have to be concerned with those things it 's my job 
 i 'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape
 by the bad spacing of the t and the e that you see there  i 've got to take that slide off i can 't stand it nor can chris
  so my talk is about the connection between technology and design of type 
 the technology has changed a number of times since i started work 
 photo  digital  desktop screen web  
 i 've had to survive those changes and try to understand their implications for what i do for design this slide is about the effect of
  tools on form  
 the two letters  the two k 's the one on your left my right
  is modern made on a computer all straight lines are dead straight  the curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness that the  bzier formula
 imposes on the right ancient
  cut in the resistant material of steel by hand none of the straight lines are actually straight  the curves are kind of subtle  
 it has that spark of life
 from the human hand that the machine or the program can never
 capture what a contrast 
 well  i tell a lie a lie at ted i 'm really sorry  both of these were made on a computer same software same
  same font format  the one
 on your left was made by zuzana licko at emigre  and i did the other one the tool is the same  
 yet the letters are different the letters are different because the designers are different that 's all
 zuzana wanted hers to look like that i wanted mine to look like that end of story type is very adaptable  unlike a fine art  such as sculpture or
  architecture type hides its methods  
 i think of myself as an industrial designer  the thing i design is manufactured  and it has a function 
 to be read to convey meaning  but there is a bit more to it than that there 's the sort of aesthetic element 
 what makes these two letters different from different interpretations
 by different designers what gives the work of some designers
 sort of characteristic personal style as you might find in the work of a fashion designer an automobile designer  whatever 
 there have been some cases i admit where i as a designer did feel the influence of technology  this is from the mid ' 60s 
 the change from metal type to photo  hot to cold this brought some benefits but also one particular drawback a
  spacing system that only provided
 eighteen discrete units for
 letters to be accommodated on 
 i was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible within this  18 unit box  
 quickly looking at the arithmetic i realized i could only actually make three
 of related design here you see them 
 in helvetica compressed  extra compressed and ultra compressed this rigid 18 unit system
 really boxed me in it kind of determined the proportions of the design 
 here are the typefaces at least the lower cases  so do you look at these and say poor matthew he had to submit to a
  problem  and by god it shows in the results 
 i hope not 
 if i were doing this same job today  instead of having eighteen spacing units  i would have one thousand 
 clearly i could make more variants but would these three members of the family be
  it 's hard to say without actually doing it but they would not be better in the proportion of one thousand to eighteen  i can tell you that
 my instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit and as i said type is very adaptable  it does hide its methods  
 all industrial designers work within constraints  this is not fine
  the question is does a constraint force a compromise by accepting a constraint are you working to a lower standard 
 i don 't believe so and i 've always been encouraged by something that charles eames said he said he was conscious of working within constraints but not of making compromises  
 the distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle  but it 's very
  remember this reading experience  the phone book i 'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia
 this is from the mid ' 70s early trials of bell centennial typeface i designed for the  u s phone books  
 and it was my first experience of digital type  and
  the phone books as i said to be printed at tiny size on newsprint
 on very high speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack 
 this is not a hospitable environment for
 a typographic designer  so the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very
  as i say we were in the infancy of digital type  i had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper there were four weights of bell centennial
 pixel by pixel then encode them raster line by raster line for the keyboard  it took two years  but i learned a lot 
 these letters look as though they 've been chewed by the dog or something or other but the missing pixels at the intersections of strokes or in the crotches
 are the result of my
  studying the effects of ink spread on cheap paper and reacting revising the font
 accordingly these strange artifacts are designed to compensate for the undesirable effects of scale
 and production process at the outset at & t had wanted to set the phone books in helvetica 
 but as my friend erik spiekermann said in the helvetica
  movie if you 've seen that 
 the letters in helvetica were designed to be as similar to one another as possible  this is not the recipe for legibility at small size  it looks very elegant up on a slide  
 i had to disambiguate these forms of the figures as much as possible in bell centennial by sort of opening the shapes up as you can see in the bottom part of that slide 
 so now we 're on to the
 mid ' 80s the early days of digital outline fonts  vector technology there was an issue
 at that time with the size of the fonts 
 the amount of data that was required to find and store a font in computer memory  
 it limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time i did an analysis
 of the
  data and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle
 because of all the points required to define the elegantly curved serif brackets  
 the numbers at the bottom of the slide by the way they represent the amount of data needed to store each each of the fonts
  so the sans serif in the middle sans the serifs was much more economical
  sans serif we call it charter on the right  so i went to the head of engineering
 with my numbers and i said proudly i have solved your problem oh 
 he said what problem and i said well you know the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on oh he
  we solved that problem last week we wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude you can have as many fonts on your system as you like 
 well thank you for letting me know i said  foiled again  
 i was left with a design solution for a nonexistent technical problem  
 but here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me  i didn 't just throw my design away in a fit of pique i persevered
  had started as a technical exercise became
 an aesthetic exercise really  in other words  i had come to like this typeface  forget its origins  screw that 
 i liked the design for its own sake  
 the simplified forms of charter
 gave it a sort of  plain spoken quality and unfussy spareness that
  at times of technical innovation designers want to be influenced by what 's in the air  we want to respond we want to be pushed into exploring something new 
 so charter is a sort of parable for me really 
 in the end there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of charter i had really misunderstood the
  technology did suggest something to me but it did not force my hand and i think this happens very often 
 you know  engineers are very smart  and despite occasional frustrations because i 'm less smart  i 've always enjoyed working with them and learning from them  
 apropos  in the mid ' 90s i started talking to microsoft
 about screen fonts up to that point  all the fonts on screen had been
  adapted from previously existing printing fonts of course  
 but microsoft foresaw correctly the the movement the stampede towards electronic communication 
 to reading and writing onscreen with the printed output as being sort of secondary in importance  so the priorities
  at that point 
 they wanted a small core set of fonts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen which were their coarse resolution displays 
 i said to microsoft a typeface designed for a particular technology is a 
 typeface i 've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems thanks to the engineers the
  technical problems went away  so did my typeface it was only a stopgap  
 microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away  
 so i thought well a decade that 's not bad that 's more than a stopgap  so i was persuaded i was convinced and we went to work on what became
 for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up 
 at that time  screens were binary the pixel was either on
 or it was off  here you see the outline of a letter the cap h  which is the thin black line the
  which is how it is stored in memory  
 superimposed on the bitmap  which is the grey area  
 which is how it 's displayed on the screen  the bitmap is rasterized from the outline
 here in a cap h which is all straight lines  the two are in almost perfect sync on the cartesian grid 
 not so with an  o this looks more like
  but believe me  this is a good bitmap o for the simple reason that it 's symmetrical in both x and y axes in a binary bitmap you actually can 't ask for more than that
 i would sometimes make i don 't know three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase a and then stand back to choose which was the best 
 well there was no
  so the designer 's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad is that a compromise 
 not to me  if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow  although that standard may be well short of the ideal 
 you may be able to see on this slide two different
 bitmap fonts there the a in the upper one i think
  the lower one but it still ain 't great
  you can maybe see the effect better if it 's reduced well maybe not 
 so i 'm a pragmatist not an idealist  out of necessity 
 for a certain kind of temperament there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect
 but can still be done to the best of your ability here 's the lowercase h from georgia italic the
  bitmap looks jagged and rough it is jagged and rough but i discovered by experiment that there is an optimum
  slant for an italic on a screen
 so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries look in this example how rough as it is how
 the left and right legs actually break at the same level that 's a victory that 's
 and of course at the lower depths 
 you don 't get much choice  this is an s  in case you were wondering  
 well it 's been eighteen years now since verdana and georgia were released 
 microsoft were absolutely right it took a good ten years 
 but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution
  and
 very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti aliasing and so on 
 so now that their mission is accomplished 
 has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that i designed for coarser displays back then 
 will they outlive the now obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market or have they established
  their own sort of evolutionary niche
 that is independent of technology  in other words have they been absorbed into the typographic mainstream i
 'm not sure but they 've had a good run so far  hey eighteen is a good age for anything with present day rates of attrition  
 so i 'm not complaining
