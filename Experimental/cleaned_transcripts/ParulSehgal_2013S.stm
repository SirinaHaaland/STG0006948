  i was eight years old a new girl came to join the class  and
 she was so impressive as the new girl always seems to be she had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case
  on state capitals 
 just a great speller and
 i just curdled with jealousy that year  until i hatched my devious plan 
 so one day i
 stayed a little late after school a little too late  and i lurked in the girls ' bathroom when the coast was clear i emerged
  into the classroom and took from my teacher 's desk the grade book 
 and then i did it 
 i fiddled with my rival 's grades just a little just demoted some of those a 's all of those a 's and
 i got ready to return the book to the drawer when hang
  some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too 
 so in a frenzy  i corrected everybody 's marks not imaginatively i gave everybody
 a row of d 's and i gave myself
 a row of a 's just because i was there you know might as well  and
 i am i am still baffled by my behavior i don 't understand where the idea came from  i don 't understand why i felt so great
 doing it i felt
 great  i don 't understand why i was never caught i mean it
 should have been so blatantly obvious i was never caught but most of all i am baffled by 
 why did it bother me so much that this little girl this tiny little girl was so good at spelling 
 jealousy baffles me it
 's so mysterious and it 's so pervasive
 we know babies suffer from jealousy  we know primates do
  are actually very prone  we know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states and yet 
 i have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness
 or its longevity
 or its grim thrill for that we have to go to fiction because the novel is the lab that has
  jealousy in every possible configuration in fact  i don 't know if it 's an exaggeration to say that if we didn 't have jealousy 
 would we even have literature 
 well no faithless helen no odyssey no jealous king no arabian nights no shakespeare 
  no jealousy no proust and now i mean i know it 's fashionable to say that proust has the answers to everything but in the case of jealousy he kind of does
 does this year is the centennial of his masterpiece in search of
  and it 's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness my brand that we can hope to have 
 and we think about proust we think about the sentimental bits right we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep we think about
 a madeleine moistened in lavender tea  
 we forget how harsh his vision was we forget how pitiless he is i mean  these are books that virginia woolf said were
 tough as cat gut i don 't know what cat gut
  is  but let 's assume it 's formidable 
 let 's look at why they go so well together  the novel and jealousy jealousy and proust 
 is it something as obvious as that jealousy which boils down into person desire  impediment is such a
 solid narrative foundation  i don 't know i think it cuts very close to the bone  because let 's
  's think about what happens when we feel jealous when we feel jealous we tell ourselves a story  
 we tell ourselves a story about other people 's lives  
 and these stories make us feel terrible because they 're designed to make us feel terrible as the teller of the tale and the audience we know just what details to include to dig that knife in 
 right  
 jealousy makes us
  all amateur novelists  and this is something proust understood in the first
 volume swann 's way the series of books swann one of the main characters is
 thinking very
 fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed and suddenly in the course of a few sentences 
 and these are proustian sentences so they 're long as rivers but
 in the course of a few sentences
  he suddenly recoils and he realizes hang on everything i love about this woman somebody else
 would love about this woman everything that she does that gives me pleasure
 could be giving somebody else pleasure maybe right about now and this is the story he starts to tell himself and from then on
 proust writes that every fresh charm swann detects in his mistress he adds to his collection of instruments in his private torture chamber 
 now swann and proust we have to admit were notoriously jealous you know proust 's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him  
 but
 you don 't have to be that jealous to concede that it 's hard work right  jealousy is exhausting it 's a hungry emotion it must be fed
  what does jealousy like  jealousy
 likes information  
 jealousy likes details  jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair the cute little pencil case  
 jealousy likes photos that 's why instagram is such a hit 
 proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy when swann is in his jealous throes and
  suddenly he 's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress ' servants he defends these behaviors he says you know look i know you think this is repugnant  
 but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument he says they are scientific investigations
 with real intellectual value proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd
  at its crux a quest for knowledge a quest for truth  painful truth  and actually where proust is concerned  
 the more painful the truth the better  grief  
 humiliation loss these were the avenues to wisdom for proust he says
  a woman whom we need who makes us suffer  elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius
 who interests us 
 is he telling us to just go and find cruel women no i think he 's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves 
 and does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way
 does any other emotion reveal to us our
  aggression and our hideous ambition
 and our entitlement does any other emotion teach us to look
 with such peculiar intensity 
 freud would write about this later one day  freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him  
  and freud says it 's something strange about this guy because he 's not looking at what his wife is doing because she 's blameless everybody knows it the poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause  
 but he 's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing unintentional behaviors is she
 smiling too brightly here or did she accidentally brush up against a man there [ freud ] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his
  the novel is very good on this point the novel is very good
 at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy in fact  
 the more intensely jealous we are 
 the more we become residents of fantasy  
 and this is why i think jealousy doesn 't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things 
 jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive
 now i 'm thinking of myself at eight i concede  but
 i 'm also thinking of this story i heard on the news a 52 year old michigan woman
 was caught creating a fake facebook account
 from which she sent vile hideous messages to herself for a year
  and she was trying to frame her ex boyfriend 's new girlfriend and
 i have to confess when i heard this i just reacted with admiration laughter
 because i mean let 's be real what immense if misplaced creativity right 
 this is something from a novel this is something from a patricia highsmith novel now highsmith is a particular favorite of mine
  she is the
 very brilliant and bizarre woman of american letters she 's the author of strangers on a train and the talented mr ripley 
 books that are all about how jealousy 
 it muddles our minds and once we 're in the sphere in that realm of jealousy the membrane between
 what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant take tom ripley
  her most famous character now tom ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have
 to being you and having what you once had and you 're under the floorboards he 's answering to your name he 's
 wearing your rings emptying your bank account that 's
 one way to go  but what do we do we can 't go the tom ripley route  i can 't give the world d 's as much as i would
  really like to some days  and it 's a pity because we live in envious times we live in jealous times  
 i mean we 're all good citizens of social media aren 't we where the currency is envy
 does the novel show us a way out  
 i 'm not sure so let 's do what characters always do when they 're not sure when they are in possession of a mystery let 's go to
 221b baker street and ask for sherlock holmes  when people think of holmes they think of
 his nemesis being professor moriarty right this criminal mastermind  but i 've always preferred
  needs his help resents him  and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries  but as they work together something starts to change  
 and finally in the adventure of the six napoleons once holmes comes in dazzles everybody with his solution
 lestrade turns to holmes and he says 
 we 're not jealous of you mr holmes  we 're proud of you
 and he says that there 's not a man at scotland yard who wouldn 't want to shake sherlock holmes ' hand it
 's one of the few times we see holmes moved in the mysteries and i find it very moving this little scene but
 it 's also mysterious right it seems to treat jealousy
 as a problem of geometry not emotion you know one minute holmes is on the other side from lestrade the next minute they 're on the same side suddenly
 lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he 's resented 
 could it be so simple though what if jealousy really is a matter of geometry just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another well 
 maybe then we wouldn 't have to resent somebody 's excellence we could align ourselves with it
