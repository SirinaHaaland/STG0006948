  i 'm
  here to talk about the wonder and the mystery
  minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence  yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder we should  in fact because without 
 having this possibility of conscious minds  we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity we would have no knowledge whatsoever about
  we would have no pains but also no joys  we would have no
 access to love or to the ability to create 
 and of course  scott fitzgerald said famously that he who invented consciousness
 would have a lot to be blamed for but he also forgot that
 without consciousness he would have no access to true happiness and even the
  so much for the wonder now for the mystery this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate 
 all the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience
  this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation has got major controversies and there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it  we should just leave it alone  it 's not to be solved i don 't believe that
  and i think the situation is changing  it would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness
 in our in our brains but we certainly can begin to approach the question  and we can begin to see the shape
 of a solution and one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that
 we have imaging technologies that now allow
  us to go inside the human brain and be able to do for example  what you 're seeing right now these are images that come from hanna damasio 's lab  and which 
  show you in a living brain the reconstruction of that brain and this is a person who is alive this is not a person that is
 amazed about is what i 'm going to show you next which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real 
  connections real pathways so all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons  the fibers that join
  i 'm sorry to disappoint you they don 't come in color  but at any rate
  they are there the colors are codes for the direction from whether it is back to front or vice versa 
 at any rate  what is consciousness what is a conscious mind
 and we could take a very simple view and say well it is that which we lose when we fall into
 deep sleep without dreams
 or when we go under anesthesia  and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia
  but what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia  or when we are in deep dreamless sleep  
 well first of all it is a mind which is a flow of mental images  and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns visual
  as you 're having right now in relation to the stage and me or auditory images as you are having now in relation to my to my words that flow of mental images is mind  
 but there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room we are not passive exhibitors of visual or
  we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now we own our minds and we have a sense that it 's everyone of us that is experiencing this not the person who is sitting
 next to you so in order to have a conscious mind  you have a self within the conscious mind 
 so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it
  the self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind  
 so what we need to know to even address this mystery is number one how are minds are put together in the brain and number two how selves are constructed 
 now
 the first part the first problem
  's not easy at all but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience  and
 it 's quite clear that in order to make minds we need to construct neural maps  so imagine a grid like the one i 'm showing you right now and now imagine within that 
  grid that  two dimensional sheet imagine neurons and picture if you will a
  digital billboard where you have elements that can be either lit or not and depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting 
  the digital elements or for that matter the neurons in the sheet you 're going to be able to construct a map 
  or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate now to bring home the point of how close it is
 the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the the activity of the neurons and our mental experience i 'm going to tell you a personal story  
 so if i cover my left eye i 'm talking about me personally not all of you if i cover my left eye i look at the grid pretty
  much like the one i 'm showing you everything is nice and fine and perpendicular  but sometime ago i discovered that if i cover my
 left eye  instead what i get is this  i look at the grid and i see a warping at the edge of my central left field very odd i 've analyzed this for a while  
  through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine carmen puliafito  who developed a laser scanner of the retina  i found out the the following  if 
 i scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner what i get is the following on the right side my retina is perfectly symmetrical you see the going down towards the fovea
  which is marked there by the red arrow and it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below and that is exactly what causes the warping of my 
 visual image so just think of this you have a grid of neurons and now you have a plane mechanical
  close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball or for that matter a sheet 
 of visual cortex so from the retina you go onto visual cortex and of course the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina and in that image there
  see a variety of islands of what i call image making regions in the brain  you have the green for example that corresponds to tactile information or the 
  blue that corresponds to auditory information  and something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps 
  purple that you see around which is the association cortex where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making and the great 
  beauty is that you can then go from memory out of those association cortices  and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception so think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy
 the the brain is so it provides certain areas for perception and image making and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information
 so far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images  but what about the self the self is really
  the elusive problem  and
 for a long time people did not even want to touch it because they 'd say how can you have this reference point this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day 
 and i thought about a solution to this problem
  we generate brain maps of the body 's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps  so let me tell you just a little bit about how i came to this 
 i came to this because 
 if you 're going to have a reference that we know as self the me the i in in our own
 processing we need to have something that is stable something that does not deviate much from day to day  well it so
  happens that we have a singular body we have one body not two not three and so that is a beginning  there is just one reference point which is the body  
 but then of course the body has many parts  and
 things grow at different rates and they have different sizes and different people however  not so with the interior  the things that have to do
 what is known as our internal milieu for example the whole management of the chemistries within our body are in fact extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason 
 if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that
 survival range you go into disease or death  so we
  within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity i like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day because if you don 't have that 
  sameness  physiologically you 're going to be sick or you 're going to die  so that 's one more element for this continuity 
  other coupling so for example i 'm making images of you  but there 's no physiological bond between the images i have of you as an audience and my 
  brain  however there is a close permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own
  here 's how it looks  look at the region there there is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord and it is within that region that i 'm going 
  to highlight now that we have this housing of all the
 devices of
 the body  this is so specific that for example  if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem  if you damage that
  as a result of a stroke for example  what you get is coma or vegetative state  which is a state of course in which your mind disappears your consciousness disappears
  what happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self you have no longer access to any feeling of your
  own existence and in fact there can be images going on being formed in the cerebral cortex  except you don 't know they 're there
  you have in effect lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem but if you consider the green part 
  of the brain stem  nothing like that happens it is that specific  so in that green component of the brain stem  if you damage it and often it happens 
 but your conscious mind is maintained you feel  you know you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly this is a horrific condition you don 't want to see it
 and people are in fact imprisoned within their own bodies  but they do have a mind there was a
 very interesting film one of the rare good films done about a situation like this by julian schnabel some
 some years ago about a patient that was in that condition  so now i 'm going to show you a picture i promise not to say anything about this  except this is to frighten you it
 's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem  there are to make it simple all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make
 brain maps of different aspects of our
  interior different aspects of our body  they are exquisitely topographic and they are exquisitely interconnected in a recursive pattern  and it is 
 out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that i believe and i could be wrong but i don 't think i am
  comes in the form of feelings
 primordial feelings by the way so what is the picture that we get here look at cerebral cortex look at brain stem look at body and you get the picture of the interconnectivity 
 in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body  and you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with
  the profusion of images that are in fact the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to as we should because that 's really the film that is rolling in our minds  
 but look at the arrows they 're not there for looks they 're there because there 's this very close interaction  you cannot have a conscious mind if you don 't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem you
  cannot have a conscious mind if you don 't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body  
 another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species  so throughout vertebrates  the design of the brain stem 
  is very similar to ours  which is one of the reasons why i think those other species have conscious minds like we do  except that they 're not as rich as ours because they
  don 't have a cerebral cortex like we do that 's where the difference is and i strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great 
  product of the cerebral cortex only the wealth of our minds is not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer
  there are three levels of self to consider the proto  the core and the autobiographical the first two are shared
 with many many other species  and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species  it 's the autobiographical self 
 which some species have i think cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to
  degree and everybody 's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree  but the novelty is here the autobiographical self is built on the basis 
 of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made  it 's the lived past and the anticipated future and the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory reasoning imagination creativity and language
 out of that came the instruments of culture
 religions  justice trade the arts science technology  and it is within that culture that we really can get and this is the novelty something that is not
 entirely set by our biology  it is developed in the cultures it developed in collectives of
 human beings and this is of course  the culture where
  have developed something that i like to call socio cultural regulation  and finally  you could rightly ask  why care about this why care if it is the brain stem 
  or the cerebral cortex and how this is made  three reasons first curiosity 
  away from the earth  why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human
 beings  second understanding society and culture we should look at how society and culture
 in this socio cultural regulation are a work in progress  and finally  medicine let 's not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression
  alzheimer 's disease drug addiction think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious  you have no prayer
 of treating those diseases effectively and in a 
 way if you do not know how this works  so that 's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we 're doing and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains
