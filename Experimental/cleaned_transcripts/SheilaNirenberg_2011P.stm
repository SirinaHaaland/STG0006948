  i study how the brain processes information that is how it takes information in from the outside world and converts it into patterns of electrical activity  and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things to see hear
  to reach for an object  
 so i 'm really a basic scientist not a clinician  but in the last year and a half i 've started to switch over 
 to use what we 've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices  
 and what i wanted to do today is
 show you an example of this it 's really our first foray into this it 's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness 
 so let me start in on that problem 
 there are ten million people in the u s and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness
  due to diseases of the retina  diseases like macular degeneration 
 and there 's little that can be done for them 
 there are some drug treatments but they 're only effective on a small fraction of the population
  and so for the vast majority of patients their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices  
 the problem is that
 current prosthetics don 't work very well  they 're still very limited in the vision that they can provide  and so you know for example with these devices
  can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges  not very much more  so nothing nothing close to normal vision has been possible 
 so what i 'm going to tell you about today is a device that we 've been working on that that i think has the potential to to make a difference to be much more effective  and what i wanted to do is show you how it works  
 okay so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve here you have a
  retina so you have an image a retina and a brain 
 so when you look at something like this image of this baby 's face  it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina on the front end cells here  the photoreceptors 
 then what happens is the retinal circuitry the middle part goes to work on it and what it does is it it performs operations on it it extracts information from
  and it converts that information into a code  
 and the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain  and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted
 into a code  and when i say code i do literally mean code  like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby 's face 
 and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses it knows that what was out there was a baby 's face  
 and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was say a dog or another pattern would be a house
 anyway you get the idea 
 and of course in real life it 's all dynamic  meaning that it 's changing all the time  
 so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you 're looking at is is changing all the time too
  so you know it 's sort of a complicated thing you have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you 're
  so what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration what happens is is that the front end cells die  the photoreceptors die  
 and over time all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them they die too  
 until the only things that you have left are these cells here the output cells the ones that send the signals to the brain  but because of all that degeneration they aren 't sending any signals anymore 
 they aren 't getting any input so the person 's brain no longer gets any visual information
  that is he or she is blind 
 so a solution to the problem then would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front end circuitry and send signals to the retina 's output cells and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain  
 so this is what we 've been working on and this is what our prosthetic does so it consists of two parts what we call an encoder and a transducer
 and so the encoder does just what i was saying it mimics the actions of the front end circuitry so it takes images in and converts them into the retina 's code  and then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain and the result is
 a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output  
 so a completely blind retina even one with no front end circuitry at all no photoreceptors can now
  send out normal signals signals that the brain can understand  so no other device has been able to do this  okay so i just want to take
 a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it 's doing because
 it 's really the key part and it 's sort of interesting and kind of cool i 'm not sure cool is really the right word but you know what i mean
  what it 's doing is it 's replacing the retinal circuitry really the guts of the retinal circuitry with
 a set of equations a set of equations that we can implement on a chip  so it 's just math 
 in other words we 're not literally replacing the components of the retina it 's not like we 're making a little mini device for each of the different cell types we 've just abstracted what the what the retina 's doing
 with a set of equations  and so in a way the equations are serving as sort of a codebook an image comes
  in goes through the set of equations  and out comes streams of electrical pulses just like a normal retina would produce 
 now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output  and what the what the implications of this are
 here are three sets of firing patterns the top one is from a normal animal  the middle one is from a blind animal that 's been treated with
  device and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic so the bottom one is the state of the art device that 's out there
 right now which is basically made up of light detectors  but no encoder  so what we did was we presented movies of everyday things people babies 
 park benches you know regular things happening
 and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals now just to orient you
  box is showing the firing patterns of several cells and just as in the previous slides  each row is a different cell  
 and i just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so i could show you a long stretch of data
  so as you can see the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the 
 really do very closely match the normal firing patterns and it 's not perfect but it 's pretty
 and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic the responses really don 't 
 and so with the standard method  the cells do fire they just don 't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don 't have the right code  
 how important is is this 
 what 's the potential impact on a patient 's ability to see so i 'm just going to show you one
  and of course i 've got a lot of other data so if you 're interested i 'm happy to show to show more  so the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment  so what we did is we took
 a moment in time from these recordings and asked what was the retina seeing at that moment can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing
 from the responses from the firing patterns 
  when we did this for responses from
 the standard method and from from our encoder and transducer  
 so let me show you and i 'm going to start with the standard method first
 so you can see that it 's pretty limited and because the firing patterns aren 't in the right code  they 're very limited in what they can tell you about what 's out there 
 so you can see that there 's something there but it
 's not so clear what that something is 
 and this just sort of circles back to what i was saying in the beginning that with the standard method patients can see
  edges they can see light  but it it doesn 't easily go further than that 
 so what was the image  it was a baby 's face
  so what about with our approach 
 adding the code  and you can see that it 's much better not only can you tell that it 's a baby 's face but you can tell that it 's this baby 's face which is a really challenging task 
 so on the left is the encoder alone  and on the right is from an actual blind retina
 so the encoder and the transducer  but the key one really is the encoder alone because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer  this is just actually the first one that we tried 
 i just wanted to say something about the standard method
 when this first came out it was just a really exciting thing  the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all  
 but there was
  this limiting factor the issue of the code  and how to make the cells respond better produce normal responses  and so this this was our contribution 
  now i just want to wrap up and
 as i was mentioning earlier of course i have a lot of other data if you 're interested but i just wanted to give this sort of basic 
  idea of being able to communicate with the brain in in
  its language and the potential power of being able to do that so it 's different from the motor prosthetics where you 're communicating from the brain to
 to a device here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood  and be understood by the brain  
 and then the last thing i wanted to say really is
 to emphasize that the idea generalizes  so the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find
  for example the auditory system and the motor system so for treating deafness and for and for motor disorders so just the same way that we were able to jump over the
 the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina 's output cells 
 we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve or jump over damaged areas in the cortex in the motor cortex to bridge the gap
  i just want to end with a simple message that
 understanding the code is really really important  and if we can understand the code  the language of the brain things become possible that that didn 't seem obviously possible before 
 thank you
