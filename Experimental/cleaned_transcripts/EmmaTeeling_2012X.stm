  what i want you all to do right now
 is to think of this mammal that i 'm going to describe to you the first thing i 'm going to tell you about this mammal
 is that it is essential for our ecosystems to
  if we remove this mammal from our ecosystems  they simply will not work that 's the first thing 
 the second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal 
 if we study this mammal we 're going to get great insight
 into our diseases of the senses  such as blindness and deafness
  and the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that i fully believe
 that the secret of everlasting youth
 lies deep within its dna  so are you all thinking so 
 magnificent creature isn 't it who here thought of a bat ah
 i can see half the audience agrees with me and i have a lot of work to do
  to convince the rest of you  so i have had the good fortune
 for the past twenty years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals 
 one fifth of all living mammals is a bat  and they have very unique attributes bats as we know them have been around on this planet
  one of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly  
 now flight is an inherently difficult thing flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times once in the bats  
 once in the birds  and once in the pterodactyls  
 and so with flight it 's very metabolically costly  bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this
 but one other extremely unique thing about bats is
 that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment they use echolocation now what i mean by echolocation
 they emit a sound from their larynx
 out through their mouth or through their nose this sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects
  their environment  and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image  
 and this enables them to orient in complete darkness 
 indeed they do look very strange we 're humans we 're a visual species when scientists first realized that bats were actually
  using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night  we didn 't believe it 
 for a hundred years despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing  we didn 't believe it 
 now if you look
 at this bat it looks a little bit alien  
 indeed the very famous philosopher thomas nagel once said 
 to truly experience an alien life form on this planet you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying echolocating bat in complete darkness
 and if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat 
 you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it 
 very big ears strange nose leaves  but teeny tiny eyes  so again if you just look at this
  you realize sound is very important for its survival 
 most bats look like the previous one  
 however there are a group that do not use echolocation 
 they do not perceive their environment using sound 
 and these are the flying foxes  if anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in australia you 've seen them coming out of the botanic gardens in sydney  and if you just look
  you can see they have much much larger eyes and much smaller ears  
 so among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception 
 now this is going to be important for what i 'm going to tell you later during the talk now if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you 
 and i know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats 
 that 's probably not that surprising
  because here in western culture  bats have been demonized really of course the famous book dracula written by a fellow northside dubliner bram stoker probably is mainly responsible for this  
 however i also think it 's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night  and we don 't really understand them we 're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us 
 bats are usually synonymous with some type
  of evil events they are the perpetrators in horror movies such as this famous nightwing 
 also if you think about it 
 demons always have bat wings  whereas birds  they typically or angels have bird wings  
 now this is western society and what i hope to do tonight is to convince you of the chinese traditional culture
  culture that they perceive bats
 as creatures that bring good luck  
 and indeed if you walk into a chinese home you may see an image such as this 
 this is considered the five blessings the chinese word for bat sounds like the chinese word for happiness 
 and they believe that bats bring
  and indeed in this image you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats  and what i want to do tonight
 is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat 
 and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings 
 so wealth
  how can a bat possibly bring us wealth now as i said before  bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly  
 and why is this
 bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants  they also feed on fruit  and they disperse the seeds of these fruits 
 bats are responsible for pollinating the tequila plant  and this is a multi million dollar industry in mexico  so indeed we need them
 for our ecosystems
  to function properly  without them it 's going to be a problem  
 but most bats are voracious insect predators  
 it 's been estimated in the u s in a tiny colony of big brown bats that they will feed on over a million insects a year 
 and in the united states of america right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as
  way slowly across the u s and wiping out populations of bats  and scientists have estimated
 that one thousand three hundred metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats  
 bats are also threatened in the u s by their attraction to wind farms  again  right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem  they 're going to they are
  threatened in the united states of america alone  
 now how can this help us 
 well  it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation  
 we 're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops  
 and for one year in the u s 
  if we remove bats  so indeed  bats then do bring us wealth  they maintain the health of our ecosystems  and also they save us money  
 so again that 's the first blessing  bats are important for our ecosystems  
 and what about the second what about health  
 inside every cell in your body lies your genome your genome is made up of your dna
  your dna codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are now since
 the new advancements in modern molecular technologies it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome
 in a very rapid time and at a very very reduced cost  now when we 've been doing this we 've realized that there 's variations
 within our genome
 so i want you to look at the person beside you just
 have a quick look and what we need to realize is that every three hundred base pairs in your dna you 're a little bit different  
 and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine
 is to work out whether this variation
 makes you more susceptible to diseases or does this variation just make you different  again what does it mean here what does this
  variation actually mean  so if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information
 that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years  we have to be able to differentiate between the two  so how do we do this well
 i believe we just look at nature 's experiments  
 so through natural selection over time
 mutations variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time  
 evolution acts as a sieve  it sieves out the bad variation  and so therefore if you look at the same region of a genome
 in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent you
  of what the evolutionary prior of that site is i e if it is important for the mammal to function for its survival  it will be the same in all of those different lineages species  taxa  
 so therefore  
 if we were to do this what we 'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it 's the same or if it 's different  so if it is
  the same this indicates that that site is important for a function so a disease mutation should fall within that site  
 so in this case here 
 if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow type genome at that site  it probably suggests that purple is bad 
 this could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently so say for example the region
 of the genome that i was looking at was a region that 's important for vision  
 if we look at that region in mammals that don 't see so well  such as bats  
 and we find that bats that don 't see so well have the purple type we know that this is probably what 's causing
 this disease  so in my lab we 've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of
 're looking at blindness now why would you do this  
 three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired 
 and forty five million of these are blind so blindness is a big problem  and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases  so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene
  the disease 
 also we look at deafness 
 one in every one thousand newborn babies are deaf  and when we reach eighty over half of us will also have a hearing problem  again  
 there 's many underlying genetic causes for this 
 so what we 've been doing in my lab is looking at these unique sensory specialists the bats  and we have looked at genes that cause blindness
  there 's a defect in them genes that cause deafness when there 's a defect in them  and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease  
 so bats are also important for our health to enable us to better understand how our genome functions  
 so this is where we are right now but what about the future what about longevity  this is where we 're going to go  
  and as i said before i really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome  
 so why should we be interested in aging at all well really this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the fountain of youth 
 aging is considered one of the most familiar  yet the least 
 aspects of all of biology  and really since the dawn of civilization mankind has sought to avoid it  but we are going to have to understand it a bit better
 in europe alone by two thousand and fifty there is going to be a seventy percent increase of individuals over sixty five 
 and one hundred and seventy percent increase in individuals over eighty 
 as we age we deteriorate  and this deterioration causes problems for our society  so we have to address it  
 so how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome
 does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for who put up your hands who says two years  
 nobody one how about ten years  
 some how about thirty how about forty  
 okay it 's a whole varied response this bat is myotis brandtii it 's the longest living bat  it lived for up to
 forty two years  and this bat 's still alive in the wild today  but what would be so amazing about this  well  typically in mammals
 there is a relationship between body size  metabolic rate  and how long you can live for and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size  
 so typically small mammals live fast  die young think of a mouse but bats are very different
  as you can see here on this graph in blue these are all other mammals but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really really high metabolic rate  and the question is how can they do that 
 there are nineteen species of mammal that live longer than expected given their body size than man and
  they must have something within their dna that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses  particularly of flight  
 they expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size but don 't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects  
 so right now in my lab  we 're combining
  molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do 
 and hopefully in the next five years i 'll be giving you a tedtalk on that aging is a big problem for humanity  
 and i believe that by studying bats we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals
  if we find out what they 're doing  perhaps through gene therapy  we can enable us to do the same thing  
 potentially this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it  just imagine what that would be like
