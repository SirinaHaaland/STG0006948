  called the danish twin study established that only about ten percent
 of how long the average person lives  within certain biological limits is dictated by our genes  the other ninety percent is dictated
 by our lifestyle so the premise of blue zones if we can
  find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity  
 but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is they probably couldn 't tell you  they 've probably heard of the south beach diet or the atkins diet you have the usda food 
  pyramid there is what oprah tells us there is what doctor oz tells us  
  really helps us live longer better  
 should you be running marathons or doing yoga  should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu 
 when it comes to supplements should you be taking them 
 how about these hormones or resveratrol and does purpose play into it spirituality
  and how about how we socialize 
 well our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic and the national institute on aging to find the four demographically confirmed areas 
 that are geographically defined  and then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do to distill down the cross cultural distillation 
  and the first myth
 is if you try really hard you can live to be one hundred  
 false  the problem is only about one out of five thousand people in america
 live to be one hundred  your chances are are very low even though it 's the fastest growing demographic in america it 's hard to reach one hundred  the problem is
 that we 're not
  programmed for longevity we are programmed for something called
 procreative success i love that word it reminds me of my college days 
 biologists term procreative success to to mean the age where you have children and then another generation the age when your children have children after that the effect of evolution completely dissipates
  if you 're a mammal  if you 're a rat or an elephant or a human in between
 it 's the same story so to make it to age one hundred you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle you also have to have won
 the genetic lottery the second myth is there are treatments that can help slow 
  when you think of it there is ninety nine things that can age us  
 deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes those brain cells die they never come back 
 play tennis too hard on your knees ruin your cartilage  the cartilage never comes back our arteries can clog our brains can gunk up with plaque and we can get alzheimer 's 
 there is just too many things to go
  're talking national debt numbers here 
 laughter those cells turn themselves over once every eight years and every time they turn themselves over there is some damage  and that damage builds up and it builds up exponentially it 's a little bit like the days when we all had
 beatles albums or eagles albums and we 'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape and let our friends copy that cassette tape and pretty soon
 with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage 
 well the same things happen to our cells that 's why a 65 year old person is aging at a rate of about one hundred and twenty five times faster
 than a 12 year old person 
 so if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging what am i doing here  
 well the fact of the matter is the best science
  tells us that the capacity of the human body  my body  your body  is about ninety years a little bit more for
 women  but life expectancy in this country is only seventy eight so somewhere along the line we 're leaving about twelve
 good years on the table these
  that they would be years largely free of chronic disease  heart disease  cancer and diabetes we think
 the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them areas where people are living to age one hundred at rates up to 
  ten times greater than we are areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction
 of what it is in this country  
 we found our first blue zone about one hundred and twenty five miles off the coast of italy on the island of sardinia  
 and not the entire island the island is about one point four million people but only up in the highlands an area called the nuoro province and here we have this area where men live the longest about ten times more centenarians
  we have here in america  and this is a place where people not only reach age one hundred they do so with extraordinary vigor 
 places where one hundred and two year olds still ride their bike to work  chop wood and can
 beat a guy sixty years younger than them 
 their history actually goes back to about the time of christ it 's actually a bronze age culture that 's been isolated because the land is so infertile they largely are shepherds
  physical activity their diet is mostly plant based accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread
 called carta musica made out of durum wheat a type of cheese made from
  grass fed animals so the cheese is high in omega 3 fatty acids instead of omega 6 fatty acids from corn fed animals
  a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world it 's called cannonau  
 but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat
 older people you ever notice here in america social equity seems to peak at about age twenty four just look at the
  here in sardinia the older you get the more equity you have the more wisdom you 're celebrated for 
 you go into the bars in sardinia instead of seeing the sports illustrated swimsuit calendar you see the centenarian of the month calendar  
 this as it turns out is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy research shows 
 it 's also good for the children of those families who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease
  disease that 's called the grandmother effect 
 we found our second blue zone on the other side of the planet 
 about eight hundred miles south of tokyo on the archipelago of okinawa  okinawa is actually one hundred and sixty one small islands and in the northern part of the main island 
 this is ground zero for world longevity this is a place where the oldest living
  female population is found it 's a place where people have the longest  disability free life expectancy in the world  
 they have what we want  they live a long time and tend to die in their sleep very quickly  and often i can tell you after sex  
 they live about seven good years longer than the average american five times as many centenarians as we have in america one fifth the rate of colon
 and breast cancer
 big killers here in america  and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease and the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us 
 what do they do 
 once again a plant based diet full of vegetables with lots of color in them  and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do 
 more significant than what
  eat is how they eat it 
 they have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating  which as you know is a big problem here in america 
 a few of the strategies we observed they eat off of smaller plates so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting  
 instead of serving family style where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you 're talking they serve at the counter put the food away and then bring it to the table 
 3 000 year old adage which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented it was invented by confucius  
 and that diet is known as the hara hatchi bu diet  it 's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [ eighty ] percent full it
 takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your
 belly to your brain and by remembering to stop at eighty percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing 
 but like sardinia okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity 
 we know that isolation kills 
 fifteen years ago the average american had three good friends we
 're down to one and half right now 
 if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through
  life  they call it a moai  and if you 're in a moai you 're expected to share the bounty if you
 if you encounter luck and if things go bad  child gets sick parent dies you always have somebody who has your back 
 this particular moai  these five ladies have been together for ninety seven years 
  their average age is one hundred and two typically in america we 've divided our adult life up into two
 sections there is our work life where we 're productive and then one day boom  
 we retire  and typically that has meant
 retiring to the easy chair or going down to arizona to to play golf 
 in the okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement instead there is one word
  that
 imbues your entire life and that word is ikigai and roughly translated it means the reason for which you wake up in the morning  for this 
  karate master his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art for this hundred year old fisherman it was continuing
  fish for his family three times a week  and this is a question the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians and one of the questions they were very culturally astute the people who put the questionnaire one of the questions was what is your ikigai they instantly knew
 why they woke up in the morning 
 for this one hundred and two year old woman her ikigai was simply her 
  two girls separated in age by one hundred and one and a half years  and i asked her what it felt like to hold a
 and she put her head back and she said it feels like leaping into heaven i thought that was a wonderful
 thought my editor at geographic wanted me to find america 's blue zone and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota
  where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians but that 's because all the young people left 
 so we turned to the data again  and we found america 's longest lived population among the seventh day adventists concentrated in and around loma linda california  
 adventists are conservative methodists  they celebrate their
 sabbath from sunset on friday till sunset on saturday
 sanctuary in time they call it 
 and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity comparatively speaking 
 in america here life expectancy for the average woman is eighty  but for an adventist woman their life expectancy
 is eighty nine and the difference is even more pronounced among men who are expected to live about eleven years longer
 than their american counterparts now this is a study that followed about seventy thousand people for thirty years sterling study  and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project 
 this is a heterogeneous community it 's white black hispanic  asian  the only thing that they have in
  set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives  
 they take their diet directly from the bible  genesis chapter one 
  where god talks about legumes and seeds  and on one more stanza about green plants  ostensibly missing is meat  
 they take this sanctuary in time very serious
 for twenty four hours every week no matter how busy they are how stressed out they are at work where the kids need to
  be driven  they stop everything and they focus on their god their social network  and then hardwired right in the religion are nature walks  
 and the power of this is not that it 's done occasionally the power is it 's done every week for a lifetime none of it 's hard  none of it costs money  
 adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists so if you go to an adventist 's party you don 't see people swilling jim beam
  or rolling a joint  instead they 're talking about
 their next nature walk exchanging recipes and yes they pray  but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways 
 this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth whareham ellsworth whareham is ninety seven years old he 's a multimillionaire
  yet when a contractor wanted six thousand dollars
 to build a privacy fence he said for that kind of money i 'll do it myself 
 so for the next three days he was out shoveling cement and hauling poles around and predictably perhaps on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room  
 but not as the guy on the table the guy
  ed rawlings one hundred and three years old now  an active cowboy  starts his morning with a swim and on weekends he likes to put on the boards  throw up rooster tails  
 and then marge deton  marge is one hundred and four her grandson actually lives in the twin cities here she starts her day with
  cadillac seville and tears down the san bernardino freeway where she still volunteers for seven different organizations 
 i 've been on nineteen hardcore expeditions i 'm probably the only person you 'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the sahara desert without sunscreen 
 but i 'll tell you there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun
 with marge deton
  a stranger is a friend i haven 't met yet she 'd say to me 
 so what are the common denominators in these three cultures what are the things that they all do  and we managed to boil it down to nine in
 fact we 've done two more blue zone expeditions since this
 and these common denominators hold true  and the first one and i 'm about to utter a heresy here
 none of them exercise 
 at least the way we think of exercise instead they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity  
 these 100 year old okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground they sit on the floor  thirty or forty times a day 
 sardinians live in vertical houses up and down the stairs every trip to the store or to church
  or to a friend 's house occasions
 a walk  they don 't have any conveniences there is not a button to push to do yard work or house work  if they want to mix up a cake they 're doing it by hand 
 that 's physical activity  that burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does when they do do intentional physical activity  it 's the things they enjoy  they tend to
  the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline  and they all tend to have a garden 
 they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook 
 each of these cultures take time to downshift 
 the sardinians pray the seventh day adventists pray the okinawans have this ancestor veneration  but when you 're in a hurry or stressed out that triggers something called the inflammatory response 
 which is associated with everything from alzheimer 's alzheimer 's disease to cardiovascular disease
 when you slow down for fifteen minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more
 they have vocabulary for sense of purpose ikigai like the okinawans 
 you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you 're born because of infant mortality and the year you retire 
 these people know their sense of purpose  and they activate in their life that 's worth about seven years of extra
  life expectancy there 's no longevity diet instead these people drink a little bit every day not a hard sell to the american population 
 they tend to eat a plant based diet  doesn 't mean they don 't eat meat but lots of beans and nuts  and they have strategies to keep from overeating little things that nudge them
 away from the table at the right
  and then the foundation of all this is how they connect they put their families first take care of their children and their aging parents 
 they all tend to belong to a faith based community  which is worth between four and fourteen extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month  
 and the biggest thing here
 is they also belong to the right tribe  they were either born into
 or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people we know from the
  framingham studies that if your three best friends are obese there is a fifty percent better chance that you 'll be overweight 
 so if you hang out with unhealthy people that 's going to have a measurable impact over time instead if your friend 's idea of
 of recreation is physical activity  bowling or playing hockey biking
  if your friends drink a little but not too much and they eat right and they 're engaged and they 're trusting and trustworthy that is going to have the biggest impact over time
