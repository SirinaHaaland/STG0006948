  the cdc and kaiser permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk
 for seven out of ten of the leading causes of death in the united states in high doses it affects brain development
  the immune system hormonal systems  and even the way our dna is read and transcribed 
 folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer
 and a 
 difference in life
  and yet doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment now 
 the exposure i 'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical it 's childhood trauma 
 okay what kind of trauma am i talking about here i 'm not talking about failing a test
 or losing a basketball game i am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get
  under our skin and change our physiology 
 things like abuse or neglect  or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence 
 now for a long time  i viewed these things in the way i was trained to view them either as a social problem refer to social services
 or as a mental health problem refer to mental health services
 and then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach 
 when i finished my residency i wanted to go someplace where i felt really needed someplace where i could make a difference 
 so i came to work for california pacific medical center one of the best private hospitals in northern california  
 and together  we opened a clinic in
 bayview hunters point one of the poorest  most underserved neighborhoods in san francisco  
 now prior to that point 
 there had been only one pediatrician in all of bayview to serve more than ten thousand children 
 so we hung a shingle  and we were able to provide top quality care regardless of ability to pay  it was so cool we targeted the typical health disparities
  access to care  immunization rates  asthma hospitalization rates  and we hit all of our numbers  we felt very proud of ourselves  
 but then i started noticing a disturbing trend a lot of kids were being referred to me for
 or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  but when i actually did a thorough history and physical
 what i found was that for most of my patients i couldn 't make a diagnosis of adhd 
 most of the kids i was seeing had experienced such severe trauma
 that it felt like something else was going on somehow i was missing something important
  before i did my residency i did a master 's degree in public health and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you 're a doctor and you see one hundred kids that all drink from the same well 
 and ninety eight of them develop diarrhea 
 you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics 
 or you can walk over and say what the hell is in this well
  i began reading everything that i could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children  
 and then one day my colleague walked into my office  and he said dr burke have you seen this 
 in his hand was a copy of a research study called the adverse childhood experiences
  study that day changed my clinical practice
 and ultimately
 my career 
 the adverse childhood experiences study is something that everybody needs to know about it was done by dr vince felitti at kaiser and dr bob anda at the cdc and
  about their history of exposure to what they called adverse childhood experiences or aces 
 those include physical emotional or sexual abuse physical or emotional neglect  parental mental illness substance dependence  incarceration  parental separation or divorce  
 or domestic violence
  for every yes you would get a point on your ace score 
 and then what they did was they correlated these ace scores against health outcomes  
 what they found
 was striking two things number one aces are incredibly common
  had at least one ace and twelve point six percent one in eight had four or more aces  
 the second thing that they found
 was that there was a 
  relationship
 between aces and health outcomes  
 the higher your ace score  the worse your health outcomes for a person with an ace score of four
  or more their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
 was two and a half times that of someone with an ace score of zero 
 for hepatitis  it was also two and a half times for depression  it was four and a half times for suicidality  it was twelve times
  a person with an ace score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer
 and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease the number one killer in the united states of america  
 well of course
 this makes sense  some people looked at this data and they said come on you have a
  you 're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health this isn 't science this is just bad behavior 
 it turns out this is exactly
 where the science comes in  we now understand better than we ever have before
 how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children  
 it affects areas like the nucleus accumbens the pleasure
  and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence  
 it inhibits the prefrontal cortex which is necessary for impulse control and executive function a critical area for learning  
 and on mri scans we see measurable differences in the amygdala  the brain 's
  response center so there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity
 are more likely to engage in high risk behavior  and that 's important to know  
 but it turns out that even if you don 't engage in any high risk behavior  you 're still more likely
 to develop heart disease or cancer
  and body 's stress response system that governs our 
 response 
 how does it work 
 well imagine you 're walking in the forest and you see a bear  
 immediately your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary  which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says release stress hormones adrenaline cortisol
 and so your heart starts to pound your pupils dilate your airways open up and you are ready to either fight that bear
 or run from the bear  and that is wonderful
 if you 're in a forest and there 's a bear 
 but the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night
  and this system is activated over and over and over again  and it goes from being adaptive or 
 to maladaptive or 
 children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation because their brains and bodies are just developing 
 high doses of
  adversity not only affect brain structure and function they affect the developing immune system 
 developing hormonal systems  and even the way our dna is read and transcribed  
 so for me this information threw my old training out the window because when we understand the mechanism of a disease
 when we know not only which pathways are disrupted but how 
 then as doctors it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment that 's what we do 
 so in san francisco we created the center for youth wellness
 to prevent  screen and heal the impacts of aces and toxic stress we
  started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical  because i know
 that if my patient has an ace score of four she 's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or copd she 's four and half times as likely to become depressed and she 's twelve times as likely to attempt to
  take her own life
 as my patient with zero aces i know that when she 's in my exam room 
 for our patients who do screen positive  
 we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices including home visits 
 care coordination mental health care  nutrition  
 holistic
  medication when necessary  
 but we also educate parents about the impacts of aces and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets  or lead poisoning  
 and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems  
 so the other thing that happens when
  you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops because this isn 't just an issue for kids in bayview 
 i figured the minute that everybody else heard about this it would be routine screening 
 multi disciplinary treatment teams and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols
  that did not happen  and that was a huge learning for me what i had thought of as simply best clinical practice
 i now understand
 to be a movement 
 in the words of dr robert block the former president of the american academy of pediatrics adverse childhood experiences
 are the single greatest unaddressed public health
  health threat
 facing our nation today 
 and for a lot of people that 's a terrifying prospect  
 the scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it 
 but for me that 's actually where the hopes lies
  because when we have the right framework when we recognize this to be a public health crisis 
 then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions 
 from tobacco to lead poisoning to hiv aids 
 the united states actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems  
 but replicating those successes with aces and toxic
  stress
 is going to take determination and commitment 
 and when i look at what our nation 's response has been so far i wonder 
 why haven 't we taken this more seriously  you know at first
 i thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn 't apply to us that 's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods which is weird
  because the data doesn 't bear that out the original aces study was done in a population
 that was seventy percent caucasian seventy percent college educated but then the more i talked to folks 
 i 'm beginning to think that maybe i had it completely
  if i were to ask how many people in this room
 grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness  
 i bet a few hands would go up  
 and then if i were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much  
 or who really believed that if you spare the rod you spoil the child  
 i bet a few more hands would go up even in
 this room 
 this is an issue that touches many of us  
 and i am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us  
 maybe it 's easier to see in other zip codes because we don 't want to look at it we
 'd rather be sick
 make that option less viable every day 
 the science is clear early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime 
 today we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death  
 and thirty years from now
  the child who has a high ace score
 and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized 
 whose asthma management is not connected  and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer
 will be just as anomalous as a six month mortality from hiv  aids people will look at that situation and say what the heck happened there
  this is treatable this is beatable 
 the single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say this is real
 and this is all of us  i believe
 that we are the movement  thank you
