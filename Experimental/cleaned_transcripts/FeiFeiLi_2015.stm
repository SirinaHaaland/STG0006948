  let me show you something
  describing what she sees in a series of photos 
 she might still have a lot to learn about this world  but she 's already an expert at one very important task 
 to make sense of what she sees 
 our society is more technologically advanced than ever we send people
  to the moon  we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like 
 yet our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task  
 so i 'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision 
 one of the most frontier and
  potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science  
 yes  we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves  
 but without smart vision 
 they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road  which can be run over and a rock that size  which should be avoided  
 we have made fabulous megapixel cameras
  we have not delivered sight to the blind  
 drones can fly over massive land but don 't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests 
 security cameras are everywhere  but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool
  photos and videos
 are becoming an integral part of global life they 're being generated at a pace that 's far beyond what any human or teams of humans could hope to view and you and i are contributing to that at this ted  
 yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous
  so in other words  collectively as a society  
 we 're very much blind  because our smartest machines are still blind 
 why is this so hard you may ask 
 cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into a two dimensional array of numbers known as pixels  
 but these are just lifeless numbers they do not carry meaning in themselves
  just like to hear is not the same as to listen to take pictures is not the same as to see  
 and by seeing we really mean understanding 
 in fact it took mother nature five hundred and forty million years of hard work to do
  and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains not the eyes themselves  
 so vision begins with the eyes  but it truly takes place in the brain  
 so for fifteen years now starting from my ph d at caltech and then leading stanford 's vision lab 
 i 've been working with my mentors
  students to teach computers to see 
 our research field is called computer vision and machine learning it 's part of the general field of artificial intelligence  
 so ultimately  we want to teach the machines to see just like we do  naming objects  
  geometry of things understanding relations  emotions actions and intentions 
 you and i weave together entire stories of people  places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them 
 the first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects  the building block of the visual world 
 in its simplest terms
  imagine this teaching process as showing the computers some training images of a particular object let 's say cats  
 and designing a model that learns from these training images 
 how hard can this be 
 after all a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors 
 and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling we 'd tell the computer algorithm
 in a mathematical language that a cat has a round face a chubby body two pointy ears and a long tail  and that looked all fine  
 but what about this cat it
 's all curled up now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model  
 but what if cats are hidden  
 what about these silly cats
 now you get my point 
 even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model and
 that 's just one object  
 so about eight years ago  a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking 
 no one tells a child
  how to see  especially in the early years  they learn this through real world experiences and examples  
 if you consider a child 's eyes as a pair of biological cameras  
 they take one picture about every two hundred milliseconds  the average time an eye movement is made
  so by age three a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world 
 that 's a lot of training examples  
 so instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms my insight
 was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences
  we know this we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images
 than we have ever had before perhaps thousands of times more 
 and together with professor kai li at princeton university we launched the  imagenet project in two thousand and seven 
  we didn 't have to mount a camera on our head and wait for many years  we went to the internet 
 the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created  
 we downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the amazon mechanical turk platform to help us to label these images 
 at its peak
  was one of the biggest employers of the amazon mechanical turk workers 
 together  almost fifty thousand workers from one hundred  and sixty seven countries around the world helped us to clean  sort 
 and label nearly a billion candidate images 
 takes in in the early developmental years 
 in hindsight this idea of using big data to train computer algorithms may seem obvious now  
 but back in two thousand and seven  it was not so obvious we were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while 
 some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure
 we were constantly struggling for research funding once
 i even joked to my graduate students that i would just reopen my dry cleaner 's shop to fund imagenet after all that 's how i funded my college years  
 so we carried on in two thousand and nine the imagenet project delivered
 a database of fifteen million images
 across twenty two thousand classes of objects and things
 organized by everyday english words in both quantity and quality  this was an unprecedented scale 
 as an example in the case of cats  we have more  than sixty two thousand cats of all kinds of looks and poses
  and across all species of domestic and wild cats  we were thrilled to have put together 
 wanted the whole research world to benefit from it 
 so in the ted fashion we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free
  now that we have the data to nourish our computer brain  
 we 're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves  
 as it turned out  
 the wealth of information provided by  imagenet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called
  just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons  
 a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron like node it takes input from other nodes
  these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers also similar to the brain 
 in a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model  it has twenty four million nodes one hundred and forty million parameters and fifteen
  to train such a humongous model the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected  
 it became the winning architecture
 to generate exciting new results in object recognition this is a computer
  us this picture contains a cat
 and where the cat is of course there are more things than cats  so here 's a computer algorithm telling us the picture contains a boy and a teddy bear  
 a dog  a person and a small kite in the background  or a picture of very busy things like a man a skateboard
  sometimes when the computer is not so confident about what it sees  
 we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much just like we would do  
 but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are like the make model  year of the cars
 we applied this algorithm to millions of google street view images across hundreds of american cities  
 and we have learned something really interesting 
 first it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household
  but surprisingly car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities  
 or voting patterns by zip codes  
 so wait a minute is that it has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities 
 not so fast  
 so far  we have just taught the computer to see objects this is like a small
  child learning to utter a few nouns  it 's an incredible accomplishment but it 's only the first step  
 soon another developmental milestone will be hit and children begin to communicate in sentences  
 so instead of saying this is a cat in the picture you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed
  so to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences  
 the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm has to take another step  
 now the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by
  like the brain integrates vision and language we developed a model that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences 
 about four months ago  we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models
 that is capable of generating a
 when it sees a picture for the first time  
 now i 'm ready to show you what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk
 of course we 're still working hard to improve our algorithms and it still has a lot to learn 
 and the computer still makes mistakes
  it thinks everything might look like a cat
  the stunning beauty of nature like you and i do  
 so it has been a long journey 
 to get from age zero to three was hard 
 the real challenge is to go from three to thirteen and far beyond let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the
  but there 's so much more to this picture than just a person and a cake 
 what the computer doesn 't see is that this is a special italian cake that 's only served during easter
  given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to sydney 
 and you and i can all tell how happy he is and what 's exactly on his mind at that moment 
 this is my son leo 
 on my quest for visual intelligence i think of leo constantly and the future world he will live in 
 when machines can see doctors
 and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients 
 cars will run smarter and safer on the road  
 robots not just humans will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded  
 we will discover new species better materials and
  explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines 
 little by little  we 're giving sight to the machines first we teach them to see  
 then they help us to see better 
 for the first time human eyes won 't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world we
 will not only use the machines for their intelligence
 we will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine 
 this is my quest to give computers visual intelligence
 and to create a better future for leo and for the world  thank you
