  when i was fourteen years old  i had
  i felt i was not talented
 at anything one day  i bought a yo yo 
 when i tried my first trick  it looked like this 
 i couldn 't even do the simplest trick  
 but
 it was very natural for me because
 i was not dextrous and hated all sports
  but after one week of practicing my throws became more like this 
 a bit better  
 i thought  the yo yo is something for me to be good at for the first time in my life  
  i found
 my passion 
 i was spending all my time practicing  it took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level  
 and then  four years later when i was eighteen years old  
 i was standing onstage at the world yoyo contest and i won i was so excited yes i did it i became a hero
  i may get many sponsors a lot of money tons of interviews and be on tv i thought 
 but after coming back to japan  totally nothing changed in my life 
 i realized society didn 't value my passion  so
 i went back to my college and became a typical japanese worker as a
  and soul had left my body  i felt i was not alive anymore so
 i started to consider what i should do and i thought  i wanted to make make my performance better  
 and to show onstage how spectacular the yo yo could be to change
  i quit my company
 and started a career as a professional performer  
 i started to learn classic ballet  jazz dance  acrobatics and other things to make my performance better 
 as a result of these efforts and the help of many others it happened 
 i won the world yoyo contest again
  if i make enough effort with huge passion there is
  me share my passion with you through my performance
