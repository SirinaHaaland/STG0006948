  ten years ago 
 on a tuesday morning i conducted a parachute jump at fort bragg north carolina  
 it was a routine training jump like many more i 'd done since i became a paratrooper twenty seven years before 
 we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early
 you do some routine refresher training and then you go to put on your parachute
 and a buddy helps you and you put on the t 10 parachute and you 're very careful how you put the straps particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs  
 and then you put on your reserve and then you put on your heavy rucksack and then a jumpmaster comes  
 and he 's an experienced nco in parachute operations he checks you out he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your
  your chest is crushed your shoulders are crushed down and of course  he 's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well
 then you sit down and you wait a little while because this is the army 
 then you load the aircraft and then you stand up and you get on and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this in a line of people and you sit down on
 canvas seats on either side of the aircraft  and you wait a little bit longer because this is the air force teaching the army how to wait
 then you take off  
 and it 's painful enough now and i think it 's designed this way it 's painful enough so you want to jump you didn 't really want to jump but you want out so
 you get in the aircraft you 're flying along and at twenty minutes out these jumpmasters start giving you commands they give twenty minutes that 's a
  you sit there ok then they give you ten minutes and of course you 're responding with all of these and that 's to boost everybody 's confidence to show that you 're not scared  
 then they give you get ready then they go outboard personnel  stand up 
 if you 're an outboard personnel now you stand up if you 're an inboard personnel  stand up  and then you hook up and you hook up your
 static line and at that point you think hey guess what i 'm
 probably going to jump there 's no way to get out of this at this point 
 you go through some additional checks  and then they open the door and this was that tuesday morning in september  
 and it was pretty nice outside so nice air comes flowing in 
 the jumpmasters start to check the door  
 and then when it 's time to go a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes go the first guy goes and you 're just in line and you just kind of lumber to the door jump is a
  you fall outside the door  you 're caught in the slipstream the first thing you do is lock into a tight body position
 head down in your chest your arms extended put over your
 reserve parachute you do that because twenty seven years before 
 an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that i have no idea whether it makes any difference but he seemed to make sense  and i wasn 't going to test the hypothesis
  and then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open  if you don 't get an opening shock you don 't get a parachute you 've got a whole new problem set 
 but typically you do typically it opens and of course 
 if your leg straps aren 't set right at that point you get another little thrill  boom 
 so then you look around  you 're under a canopy and you say this is good
  now you prepare for the inevitable you are going to hit the ground  
 you can 't delay that much  and you really can 't decide where you hit very much because they pretend you can steer but
 you 're being delivered so
 you look around where you 're going to land you try to make yourself ready and then as you get close you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line so that it 's not on you when you land and you prepare to do a parachute landing fall 
 now the army teaches you to do five points of performance
 the toes of your feet
 your calves your thighs your buttocks and 
 it 's this elegant little
 land  twist and roll  and that 's not going to hurt in 30 some years of jumping i never did one 
 i always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window 
 and as soon as i hit the first thing i did is i 'd see if i 'd broken anything that i needed
 i 'd shake my head  and i 'd ask myself the eternal question why didn 't i go into banking 
 and i 'd look around  and then i 'd see another paratrooper a young guy or girl
  and they 'd have pulled out their m4 carbine and they 'd be picking up their
  they 'd be doing everything that we had taught them and i realized
 that if they had to go into combat 
 they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders and i realized that if they came out of combat it would be because we led them well  
 and i was hooked again on the importance of what i did 
 so now
 i do that tuesday morning jump but it 's not any jump that was september  11th two thousand and one and when we
  took off from the airfield america was at peace when we landed on the  drop zone everything had changed 
 and what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical
 was now very very real
 and leadership seemed important  but things had changed i was a 46 year old brigadier general
  but things changed so much
 that i was going to have to make some significant changes and on that morning i didn 't know it 
 i was raised with traditional stories of leadership robert e lee john buford at gettysburg  
 and i also was raised
 with personal examples of leadership 
 this was my father in vietnam  and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave
 and faithful
 they didn 't lie cheat steal or abandon their comrades and i still believe real leaders are like that 
 but in my first twenty five years of career i had a bunch of different experiences one of my first battalion commanders i worked in his battalion 
  for eighteen months and the only conversation he ever had with lt mcchrystal was at mile eighteen
  of a 25 mile road march  and he chewed my ass for about forty seconds  and i 'm not sure that was real interaction  
 but then a couple of years later when i was a company commander  i went out to the national training center  and we did an operation  and my company
 did a dawn attack you know the classic dawn attack you prepare all night move to the line of departure
 i had an armored organization at that point we move forward  and we get wiped out i mean wiped out immediately the enemy didn 't break a sweat doing it 
 and after the battle they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an after action review to teach you what you 've done wrong  sort of leadership by humiliation  
 they put a big screen up and they take you through everything and then you didn 't do this and you didn 't do this etc 
 i walked out feeling as low as a snake 's belly in a wagon rut  
 and i saw my battalion commander because i had let him down
  and i went up to apologize to him and he said stanley i thought you did great 
 and in one sentence he lifted me put me back on my feet
 and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure 
 when nine eleven came
  mcchrystal sees a whole new world 
 first the things that are obvious that you 're familiar with  the environment changed the speed  the scrutiny the sensitivity of everything now is so fast sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it  
 but everything we do is in a different context 
 more importantly the force that i led was
 spread over more than twenty countries 
 and instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them  i 'm now leading a force that 's dispersed  
 and i 've got to use other techniques  
 i 've got to use video teleconferences i 've got to use chat i 've got to use email i 've got to use phone calls i 've got to use everything i can not just for
  operating alone thousands of miles from me 
 has got to communicate to me with confidence  i have to have trust in them and vice versa  and i also have to build
 their faith  
 and that 's a new kind of leadership for me  
 we had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations an emerging opportunity came didn 't have time to get everybody together
 so we we had to get complex intelligence together  we had to line up the ability to act  it was sensitive we had to go up the chain of command  convince them that this was 
  the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium  
 the mission didn
  and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force rebuild their confidence me and them and them and me 
 and our seniors and us as a force all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder  
 entirely new requirement 
 also the people had changed  you probably think that the force that i led was all  steely eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying
 exotic weapons in reality much of the force i led
 looked exactly like you 
 it was men women young old not just from military from different organizations many of them detailed to us just from a handshake  
 and so instead of giving orders
  now building consensus and you 're building a sense of shared purpose 
 probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference the ages had changed so much  
 i went down to to be with a ranger platoon on an operation in afghanistan 
 and on that operation a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a taliban hand grenade
 back at the enemy after it had landed in his
  fire team 
 we talked about the operation  and then at the end i did what i often do with a force like that i asked where were you on nine eleven 
 and one young ranger in the back his hair 's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold afghan wind
  i was in the sixth grade and it reminded me
 that we 're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness  
 and yet he has different experiences in many cases a different vocabulary a completely different skill set in terms of digital media
 than i do and many of the
  and yet we need to have that shared sense 
 it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics 
  and whatnot that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn 't what the force was doing anymore  so how does a leader
  doing  and it 's a brand new leadership challenge and it forced me to become a lot more transparent a lot more willing to listen a lot more willing to be
  from lower and yet again you 're not all in one room then another thing there 's an effect
  you don 't reset or recharge your battery every time  i stood in front of a screen one night in iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces  and i remembered his son was in our force and i said john where 's your son  
 and how is he and he said sir he 's fine thanks for asking i said where is he now and he pointed at the screen
  think about watching your brother father  daughter son  wife
 in a firefight in real time and you can 't do anything about it 
 think about knowing that over time and it 's a new cumulative pressure on leaders and you have to watch and take care of each other 
 i probably learned the most about relationships
  the sinew which hold the force together
 i grew up much of my career in the ranger regiment and every morning in the ranger regiment 
 every ranger and there are more than two thousand of them says a six stanza ranger creed  you may know one line of it it says i 'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy 
 and it 's not a mindless mantra and it 's not a poem 
  it 's a promise every ranger promises every other ranger no matter what happens no matter what it costs me if you need me i 'm coming 
 and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger 
 think about it it 's extraordinarily powerful it 's probably more powerful than marriage vows  
 and they 've lived up to it which gives it special power  and so the organizational relationship that bonds them
 is just amazing  and i
  learned personal relationships were more important than ever 
 we were in a difficult operation in afghanistan in two thousand and seven and an old friend of mine that i had spent many years at various points of my career with
 godfather to one of their kids
 he sent me a note just in an envelope that had a quote from sherman to grant
  i knew if i ever got in a tight spot that you would come if alive 
 and having that kind of relationship for me turned out to be critical
 at many points in my career and i learned that you have to give that
 in this environment because it 's tough 
 that was my journey  
 i hope it 's not over i came to believe that a leader isn 't good because they 're right they 're good because they 're willing to learn
  and to trust 
 this isn 't easy stuff it
 's not like that electronic abs machine where fifteen minutes a month you get washboard abs 
 and it isn 't always fair 
 you can get knocked down  and it hurts and it
