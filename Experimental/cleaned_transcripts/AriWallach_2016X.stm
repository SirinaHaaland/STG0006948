  which is a term i made up 
 about three seconds ago i 've been futuring for about twenty years  and when i first started i would sit down with people
  been seeing that time horizon get shorter and shorter and shorter so much so that i met with a ceo two months ago and i said
 we started our initial conversation he goes i love what you do i want to talk about the next six months 
 laughter we have a lot of problems
  the issue though is we can 't solve them
 using the mental models that we use right now to try and solve these problems yes a lot of great technical work is being done 
 but there is a problem that we need to solve for a priori before if we want to really move the needle on those big problems 
  there 's no marches there 's no bracelets there 's no petitions that you can sign to be against short termism i tried to put one up and no one
 signed it was weird but it prevents us from doing so much
 for many reasons has pervaded every nook and cranny of our reality i just want you to take a second and just think about
  be personal it could be at work or it could be move the needle world stuff and think about
 how far out you tend to think about the the solution set for that because
 prevents the ceo from buying really expensive safety equipment it 'll hurt the bottom line  so we get the deepwater
  time with their students so right now in america a high school student drops out every twenty six seconds
 short termism prevents congress sorry if there 's anyone in here from congress or
 not really that sorry 
 from putting money into a real infrastructure bill so what we get is the
 i 35w bridge collapse over the mississippi a few years ago thirteen killed 
 it wasn 't always like this we did the panama canal we
 pretty much have eradicated global polio  we did the transcontinental railroad the marshall plan  
 and it 's not just big physical infrastructure problems and issues  women 's suffrage the right to vote  but in our
  seems to happen right now and we can only think out past the next tweet or timeline post we get 
 so what do we do 
 we take people who are fleeing their  war torn country  and we go after them  we take low level drug offenders and we put them away for life  and then we build
  without even thinking about how people are going to get between them and their job it 's a quick buck now the reality is for a lot of these problems there are some
 technical fixes a lot of them  i call these technical fixes sandbag strategies
  so you know there 's a storm coming the levee is broken no one 's put any money into it you surround your home with sandbags  and guess what it works 
 storm goes away the water level goes down you get rid of the sandbags  and you do this
  storm after storm after storm and here 's the insidious thing a sandbag strategy
 can get you reelected a sandbag strategy can help you make your quarterly numbers 
 now if we want to move forward into a different future than the one we have right now because i don 't think we 've hit
  peak civilization there 's some more we can do but
 my argument is that unless we shift our mental models and our mental maps on how we think about the short  it 's not going to happen 
 so what i 've developed is something called longpath and it 's a practice and
  i 'm sure everyone here at some point has done an off site with a lot of post it notes and whiteboards  and you do you do no offense to the consultants in here who do that
 and you do a long term plan  and then two weeks later everyone forgets about it right 
 or a week later if you 're lucky three months  it 's a practice because it 's not necessarily a thing that you
  it 's a process where you have to revisit different ways of thinking for every major decision that you 're working on so i want to go through those three ways of thinking  
 so the first
  transgenerational thinking  i love the philosophers  plato socrates habermas heidegger i was raised on them  
 but they all did one thing that didn 't actually seem like a big deal until i really started kind of looking into this and they all took 
 as a unit of measure
  for their entire reality of what it meant to be virtuous and good the single lifespan  
 from birth to death  
 but here 's a problem with these issues 
 they stack up on top of us because the only way we know how to do something good in the world is if we do it between our birth and our death that 's what we 're programmed to do if you go to the self help section in any bookstore  
 it 's all about you  
 which is great
  unless you 're dealing with some of these major issues  and so with
  thinking  which is really kind of transgenerational ethics you 're able to expand how you think about these problems what is
 your role in helping to solve them now this isn
  this isn 't something that just has to be done at the security council chamber  it 's something that you can do in a very kind of personal way  so every
 once in a while if i 'm lucky my wife and i like to go out to dinner  and we have three children
 under the age of seven  so you can imagine it 's a very peaceful quiet meal so we sit down and literally all i want to do is just eat
 and chill  and my kids have a completely and totally different idea of what we 're going to be doing and so my
 is my is my sandbag strategy right it 's to go into my pocket and take out the iphone and give them frozen or
 some other bestselling game thing  and
 then i stop and i have to kind of put on this
 and you have to kind of
 think ok  i can do this but what is this teaching them  
 so what does it mean if i actually bring some paper or engage with them in conversation it 's hard it 's not easy and i 'm making this very personal it 's actually more traumatic than some of the big issues that i work on in the world entertaining my kids
  but what it does is it connects them here in the present with me but it also and this is the the crux of transgenerational thinking ethics
 it sets them up to how they 're going to interact with their kids and their kids and their kids 
 second futures thinking when we think about the future ten fifteen years out 
  have to give it to me but think in your head and
 what you 're probably going to see is the dominant cultural lens that dominates our thinking about the future right now technology  
 so when we think about the problems we always put it through a technological lens a
 and there 's nothing wrong with that but it 's something that we have to really think deeply about
  're going to move on these major issues  because it wasn 't always like this right the ancients had their way of thinking
 about what the future was the church definitely had their idea of what the
 future could be and you could actually pay your way into that future right  and luckily for humanity  we got the scientific revolution 
 from there we got the technology  but what has happened and by the way this is not a critique
  i love technology everything in my house talks back to me from my children to my speakers to everything 
 but we 've abdicated the future from from the high priests in rome
 to the high priests
 of silicon valley  so when we think well how are we going to deal with climate or with poverty or homelessness our first reaction
  is to think about it through a technology  technology lens  
 and look i 'm not advocating that we go to this guy i love joel don 't get me wrong  
 but i 'm not saying we go we go to joel what i 'm saying is we have to rethink our base
 assumption about only looking at the future in one way only
  it through the dominant lens because our problems are so big and so vast that we need to open ourselves up so that 's why
 i do everything in my power not to talk about the future i talk about futures  it opens the conversation again so when you 're sitting
 and thinking about how do we move forward on this major issue it could be at home it could be at work 
  on the global stage
 don 't cut yourself off from thinking about something beyond technology as a fix because we 're more concerned about technological evolution right now than we are about moral evolution 
 and unless we fix for that we 're not going to be able to get out of short termism and get to where we want to be 
 the final telos thinking this comes from the greek root  ultimate aim and ultimate purpose  and it 's really asking one question to what end
  when was the last time you asked yourself to what end 
 and when you asked yourself that how far out did you go because long isn 't long enough anymore 
 three five years doesn 't cut it it 's thirty forty fifty one hundred years 
 in homer 's epic the odyssey odysseus had
 the answer to his what end it was ithaca  it was this bold vision of
  he wanted to return to to penelope  and i can tell you because of the work that i 'm doing but also you know it intuitively we have lost our ithaca  
 we have lost our to what end so we stay on this hamster wheel and yes we 're trying to solve these problems  but what comes after
 we solve the problem  and unless you define what comes after people aren 't going to
  they 're telos they think about the futures and this is an ad for patek philippe they 're one hundred and  seventy five years old and what 's amazing
 is that they literally embody this kind of longpathian sense in their brand because by the way you never actually own a patek
  unless somebody wants to just throw twenty five thousand dollars on the stage you merely look after it for the next generation  
 so it 's important that we remember the future  
 we treat it like a noun  it 's not it
 's a verb it requires action  it requires us to push into it it 's not this thing that washes over us it 's something that we actually have total control
  we end up feeling like we don 't we feel like we 're trapped we can push through that 
 now i 'm getting more comfortable in the fact that at some point
 in the inevitable future i will die  but because of these new ways of thinking and doing  both in the
  and also with my family at home  and what i 'm leaving my kids i get more comfortable in that fact and it 's something that a lot of us are really uncomfortable with 
 but i 'm telling you 
 think it through 
 apply this type of thinking and you can push yourself past what 's inevitably very very uncomfortable and it all begins really with yourself asking this question
 what is your longpath 
  but i ask you when you ask yourself that now or tonight or behind a steering wheel or
 in the boardroom or the situation room 
 push past the longpath quick oh what 's my longpath the next three years or five years 
 try and push past your own life if you can because it makes you do things a little bit bigger than you thought were possible 
 yes we have huge huge problems out there
  with this process with this thinking  
 i think we can make a difference  i think you can make a difference  and i believe in you guys  thank you
