  fifteen years ago after a twenty year stay in the united states and africa called me back and i founded my country 's
  graphic design and new media college and i called it the zimbabwe institute of vigital arts
 the idea the dream was really for a sort of bauhaus sort of school where new ideas were interrogated
 and investigated
 the creation of a new visual language based on the african creative heritage
 we offer a two year diploma
 to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education
 and typography 's a very important part of the curriculum and we encourage our students to look inward for influence
 here 's a poster designed by one of the students under the theme education is a right
 some logos designed by my students
  africa has had a long tradition of writing but this is not such a well known fact and i wrote the book afrikan alphabets to address that
 the different types of writing in africa first was proto writing
 as illustrated by nsibidi which is the writing system of a secret society of the ejagham people in southern nigeria
 so it 's a special interest writing system the akan of people of ghana
 developed adinkra symbols some four hundred years ago
 and these are proverbs historical sayings objects animals plants and my favorite adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left it 's called sankofa it means return
  return and get it learn from the past
 this pictograph by the jokwe people of angola tells the story of the creation of the world at the top is god
 at the bottom is man mankind
 and on the left is the sun on the right is the moon all the paths lead to and from god
 these secret societies of the yoruba kongo and palo religions in nigeria congo and angola respectively
 developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in in the new world in cuba
 brazil and trinidad and haiti
 in
  the rainforests of the democratic republic of congo
 in the ituri society
 the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree and the women who are also the praise singers
 paint interweaving patterns that are the same in structure as the polyphonic structures that they use in their singing
 a sort of a musical
  score if you may
 in south africa ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes
 in bright colors and the zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces
 ethiopia has had the longest tradition of writing with the ethiopic script
  that was developed in the fourth century a d and is used to write amharic which is spoken by over twenty four million people
 king ibrahim njoya of the bamum kingdom of cameroon developed shu mom at the age of twenty five
 shu mom is a writing system it 's a syllabary it 's not exactly an alphabet and here we see three stages of development
  that it went through in thirty years
 the vai people of liberia had a long tradition of literacy
 before their first contact with europeans in the one thousand eight hundred s it 's a syllabary and reads from left to right
 next door in sierra leone the mende also developed a syllabary but
  theirs reads from right to left
 africa has had a long tradition of design a well defined design sensibility
 but the problem in africa has been that especially today designers in africa struggle with all forms of design because
 they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration
  the creative spirit in africa the creative tradition is as potent as it has always been
 if only designers could look within
 this ethiopic cross illustrates what dr ron eglash has established that africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals
 africans of antiquity created civilization
 and their monuments which still stand today are a true testimony of their greatness
 most probably one of humanity 's greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet and that has been attributed
  hundred bc followed by hieroglyphics in egypt
 and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact
 that is until one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight
 when one yale professor john coleman darnell discovered these inscriptions in the thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western
  egypt
 and these have been dated at between one thousand eight hundred and one thousand nine hundred b c centuries before mesopotamia
 called wadi el hol because of the place that they were discovered
 these inscriptions research is still going on a few of them have been deciphered
 but there is consensus among scholars
  that this is really humanity 's first alphabet
 over here you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far starting with the letter a ƒÅlep at the top and bet in the middle and so forth
 it is time that students of design in africa read the works of titans
  like cheikh anta diop senegal 's cheikh anta diop whose seminal work on egypt is vindicated by this discovery
 the last word goes to the great jamaican leader marcus mosiah garvey and the akan people of ghana with their adinkra symbol sankofa
 which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present
  and build on a future for us and our children
 it is also time that designers in africa stop looking outside
 they 've been looking outward for a long time yet what they were looking for
 has been right there within grasp right within them
 thank you very much
