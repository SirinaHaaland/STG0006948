  have two missions here today the first is to
 tell you something about pollen i hope  and to convince you that it 's more than just something that gets up your nose and secondly to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope
  is a flower 's way of making more flowers 
 it carries male sex cells from one flower to another this gives us genetic diversity or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity  
 and it 's really rather better not to mate with yourself that 's probably true of humans as well mostly
  pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers  each anther can carry up to one hundred thousand grains
  of pollen  
 so it 's quite prolific stuff  
 and it isn 't just bright flowers that have pollen it 's also trees and grasses and remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well  
 here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen the little hole in the middle we 'll come to a bit later but that 's for
 the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny
  tube so that 's twenty micrometers across that
 pollen grain there that 's about a 50th of a millimeter but not all pollen is quite so simple looking this is morina this is a
 plant which i 've always thought to be rather tedious named after morin  who was an enterprising french gardener who issued the first seed catalog
 this is amazing i think that little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another morina flower just on the right species what happens 
 like i said pollen carries the male sex cells if you
 actually didn 't realize that plants have sex they have rampant promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex really
 my story is actually not about plant propagation  but about pollen itself 
 so what are pollen 's properties i hear you ask 
 first of all pollen is tiny  yes we know that it 's also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand now pollen from plants which are 
 like trees and grasses and so on tend to cause the most hay fever and the reason for
  that is they 've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species  here are some examples they 're very smooth if you look at them of tree pollen that
 is meant to be carried by the wind  
 again this time sycamore wind dispersed so trees very boring flowers  not really trying to attract insects
  this one i particularly like this is the monterey pine which has little air sacks to make the pollen carry even further remember that thing is just about thirty micrometers across  
 now it 's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding  this is a bee 's leg
 with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant
  and this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm very showy to attract lots of insects to do its bidding the pollen has little barbs on it 
 if we look 
 now  those little barbs
 obviously stick to the insects well
  but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this if it was the earth 
 that tells me that it 's actually been fossilized this pollen and i 'm rather proud to say that this was found just near london
 and that fifty five million years ago london was full of mangroves isn 't that cool 
 okay so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects you can tell that from the little barbs on there 
 all these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope actually in the lab
  no coincidence that these were taken by rob kesseler who is an artist and i think it 's someone with a design and artistic eye
 like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen now 
 all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain
 and tell what species it came from  and that 's actually quite handy if you
 maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from  so different species of plants grow in different places
  and some pollen carries further than others  
 so  if you have a pollen sample then in principle you should be able to tell where that sample came from  
 and this is where it gets interesting for forensics 
 pollen is tiny it gets on to things and it sticks to them 
  not only does each type of pollen look different but each habitat has a different
 combination of plants a different pollen signature if you like or a different pollen fingerprint 
 by looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample 
 you can tell very precisely where it came from 
 this is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt similar to the one that i 'm wearing now  now much of the pollen will still be there after repeated
  washings where has it been  
 four very different habitats might look similar but they 've got very different pollen signatures 
 actually this one is particularly easy these pictures were all taken in different countries  but pollen forensics can be very subtle it
 's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made 
 where banknotes have come from 
 to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they
  really did come from the place the seller said they did 
 and murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing certainly in the u k to within an area that 's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim  
 so you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer
  where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs 
 and finally in a rather grizzly way the bosnia war crimes some of the people brought to trial
 were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen which showed that bodies had been buried exhumed and then reburied somewhere else
