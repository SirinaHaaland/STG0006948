  yale graduate and professor set out from his rainforest camp with his team  
 after climbing a steep hill and wiping the sweat from his brow he described
 what he saw
 he saw rising from the dense rainforest foliage this incredible interlocking maze of structures built of granite  
 beautifully put together what
 's amazing about this project is that it was the first funded by national geographic and it graced the front cover of its magazine in one thousand nine hundred and twelve 
 this professor used
  record the site  forever changing the face of exploration the site
 was machu picchu  discovered and explored by hiram bingham  
 when he saw the site he asked this is an impossible dream what could it be so
  one hundred years later i invite you all on an incredible journey with me
 yale graduate and professor 
 we will do nothing less than use state of the art technology to map an entire country 
 this is a dream started by hiram bingham  but we are
 expanding it to the world making archaeological exploration more open  
 inclusive  and at a scale simply not previously possible 
 this is why i am so excited to share with you all today
 that we will begin the two thousand and sixteen ted prize platform in latin america more specifically
  we will be taking hiram bingham 's impossible dream
 and turning it into an amazing future that we can all share in together  
 so peru doesn 't just have machu picchu it has absolutely stunning jewelry  like what you can see here  
 it has amazing moche pottery of human figures  it has
  the nazca lines and amazing textiles 
 so as part of the ted prize platform we are going to partnering with some incredible organizations first of all with digitalglobe the world 's largest provider of high resolution commercial satellite imagery
 they 're going to be helping us build out this amazing crowdsourcing platform they have maybe some of you used it with the
  crash and search for the airplane of course they 'll also be providing us with the satellite imagery  
 national geographic will be helping us with education and of course exploration 
 as well they 'll be providing us with rich content for the platform including some of the archival imagery like you saw at the beginning of this talk and some of their documentary footage 
  already begun to build and plan the platform  and i 'm just so excited so here 's the cool part 
 my team headed up by chase childs is already beginning to look at some of the satellite imagery of course  what you can see here is 0 3 meter data this is site 
  called chan chan in northern peru it dates to eight hundred and fifty ad it 's a really amazing city but let 's zoom in this is the type and quality of data that you all will get to see 
  begun to find previously unknown sites what we can say already is that as part of the platform you will all help discover thousands of previously unknown sites like this one here 
 and this potentially large one here  
 unfortunately we 've also begun to uncover large scale looting at sites like what you see here  so many sites in peru are
  but the great part is that all of this data is going to be shared with archaeologists on the front lines of protecting these sites 
 so i was just in peru  meeting with their minister of culture as well as unesco we 'll be collaborating closely with them just so you all know the site is going to be in both english 
 and spanish which is absolutely essential to make sure that people in peru and across latin america can participate
  our main project coprincipal investigator is the gentleman you see here dr luis jaime castillo professor at catholic university
  as a respected peruvian archaeologist and former 
  castillo will be helping us coordinate and share the data with archaeologists so they can explore these sites on the ground  
 he also runs this amazing drone mapping program some of the images of which you can see behind me here and
  and this data will be incorporated into the platform  and also he 'll be helping to image some of the new sites you help find
 who will be helping us with education outreach as well as site preservation components is the sustainable preservation initiative led by dr larry coben 
 some of you may not be aware that some of the world 's poorest communities coexist with some of the world 's most
  archaeological sites 
 what spi does is it helps to empower these communities in particular women with new economic approaches and business training so it helps to teach 
  them to create beautiful handicrafts which are then sold on to tourists this empowers the women to treasure their cultural heritage and take ownership of it i had the opportunity to spend some time with twenty four of these
  just outside lima 
 these women were unbelievably inspiring and what 's great is that spi will help us transform communities near some of the sites that you help to discover 
 peru is just the beginning we 're going to be expanding this platform to the world but already i 've gotten thousands of emails from people all across the world professors  educators 
  and other archaeologists who are so excited to help participate in fact they 're already suggesting
 amazing places for us to help discover including atlantis i don 't know if we 're going to be looking for atlantis but you never know
  so i 'm just so excited to launch this platform it 's going to be launched formally by the end of the year  and i have to say if what my team has already 
  discovered in the past few weeks are any indication what the world discovers is just
  going to be beyond imagination make sure to hold on to your alpacas  thank you very much
