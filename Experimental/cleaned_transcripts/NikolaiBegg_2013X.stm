  the first time i stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery  i had no idea what to expect 
 i was a college student in engineering  i thought it was going to be like on tv  ominous music playing in the background
  beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon 's face  but it wasn 't like that at all there was music playing on this day i think it was madonna 's greatest hits 
 and there was plenty of conversation not just about the patient 's heart rate but about sports and weekend plans  
 and since then  the more surgeries i watched the more i realized this is how it is in some weird way it 's just another day at the office  
 but every so often
 the music gets turned down everyone stops talking and stares at exactly the
  same thing  and that 's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening 
 the first time i saw that i was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery
 and for those of you who are unfamiliar 
 laparoscopic surgery instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery 
 a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates these three or more small incisions in the patient  and then inserts these long
  long thin instruments and a camera  and actually does the procedure inside the patient 
 this is great because there 's much less risk of infection much less pain shorter recovery time 
 but there is a trade off 
 because these incisions are created
 with a long  pointed device called a trocar
  and the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through 
 and now the reason why everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day
 was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs and blood vessels below  
 but this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you because i 'm pretty sure you 've seen it somewhere else
 you knew that at any second that straw 
  was going to plunge through and you didn 't know if it was going to go out the other side and straight into your hand or if you were going to get juice everywhere  but you were terrified 
  and it turns out it really is a problem 
 in two thousand and three the fda actually came out and said that trocar incisions might be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery  
 again in two thousand and nine we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery and oh by the way
  this hasn 't changed for twenty five years  
 so when i got to graduate school this is what i wanted to work on
  i was trying to explain to a friend of mine what exactly i was spending my time doing and i said 
 it 's like when you 're drilling through a wall
 to hang something in your apartment there 's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall and there 's this
 plunge right  and he looked at me and he said
 you mean like when they drill into people 's brains and i said excuse me 
 and then i looked it up and they do drill into people 's brains a lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull  
 and if the surgeon isn 't careful he can plunge directly into the brain 
 so this is the moment when i started thinking okay cranial drilling
  laparoscopic surgery  why not other areas of medicine because think about it when was the last time you went to the doctor and you didn 't get stuck with something 
 right so the truth is in medicine puncture is everywhere  and here are just a couple of the procedures that i 've found
 that involve some tissue puncture step and if we take just three of them
 laparoscopic
  and cranial drilling
 these procedures account for over thirty thousand complications every year in this country alone  i call that a problem worth solving  
 so let 's take a look at some of the devices
 that are used in these types of procedures 
 i mentioned epidurals this is an epidural needle it 's used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth
  here 's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools these are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions 
 here 's a bayonette from the civil war 
 if i had told you it was a medical puncture device you probably would have believed me
  because what 's the difference  so the more i did this research the more i thought there has to be a better way to do
  and for me
 the key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics  
 so what are those physics let 's go back to drilling through a wall  
 so you 're applying a force on a drill towards the wall and newton says the wall is going to apply force back  equal and opposite 
 so as you drill through the wall those forces balance  
 but then there 's that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall and right at that moment the wall
  can 't push back anymore  but your brain hasn 't reacted to that change in force 
 so for that millisecond or however long it takes you to react you 're still pushing  and that unbalanced force causes an acceleration  and that is the plunge  
 but what if
 what if right at the moment of puncture
 you could pull that tip back actually oppose the forward acceleration that 's what i set out to do
  so imagine you have a device and it 's got some kind of sharp tip to cut through tissue what 's the simplest way you could pull that tip back  
 i chose a spring  
 so when you extend that spring you extend that tip out so it 's ready to puncture tissue 
 the spring wants to pull the tip back  how do you keep the tip in place until the moment of puncture 
 i used this mechanism when the tip of the device is pressed against tissue
 the mechanism expands outwards and wedges in place against the wall 
 and the friction that 's generated locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip but right at the moment of puncture the tissue can 't push back on the tip anymore  
 so the mechanism unlocks and the spring retracts the tip let
 me show you that happening in slow motion this is about two thousand frames a second and i 'd like you to notice the tip
 that 's right there on the bottom about to puncture through tissue
  right at the moment of puncture 
 right there the mechanism unlocks and retracts that tip back i
 want to show it to you again a little closer up you 're going to see the sharp bladed tip  and right when it punctures that rubber membrane it 's going to disappear into this
 white blunt sheath right there that happens
  of a second after puncture 
 and because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery or another procedure it 's applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales  
 but it didn 't always look like this this was my first prototype  
 yes those are popsicle sticks and there 's a rubber band at the top it took about thirty minutes to do this  but it worked and
  it proved to me that my idea worked and it justified the next couple years of work on this project  
 i worked on this because this problem really fascinated me it kept me up at night  
 but i think it should fascinate you too because i said puncture is everywhere that means at some point it 's going to be your problem too 
 that first day in the operating room i never expected to find myself on the other end of a trocar but last year
  i got appendicitis when i was visiting greece 
 so i was in the hospital in athens 
 and the surgeon was telling me he was going to perform a laparoscopic surgery he was going to remove my appendix through these tiny incisions 
 and he was talking about what i could expect for the recovery and what was going to happen he said do you have any questions and i said just one doc 
 what kind of trocar do you use 
 so my favorite quote about laparoscopic surgery
  comes from a doctor h c jacobaeus it is puncture itself
 that causes risk that 's my favorite quote because h c jacobaeus was the first person to ever perform laparoscopic surgery on humans  
 and he wrote that in one thousand nine hundred and twelve 
 this is a problem that 's been injuring and even killing people for over one hundred years  
 so it 's easy to think that for every major problem out there
 's some team of experts working around the clock to solve it the truth is that 's not always the case  
 we have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them 
 so if you come across a problem that grabs you let it keep you up at night  allow yourself to be fascinated because there are so many lives to save
