  i was born in a middle class family  my father was five years old when he lost his father  but by the time
 i was born  he was already a businessman
 but it didn 't make a difference to him
 if his children were going to be a boy or a girl they were going to go to school  so i guess i was the lucky one 
 my mother had sixteen pregnancies  from sixteen pregnancies  five of us are alive  
 you can imagine
 as a child what i went through
 day to day i watched women
 being carried to a graveyard  or watched children going to a graveyard  
 at that time  when i finished my high school  i really wanted to be a doctor  
 i wanted to be a doctor to help women and children 
 so i completed my education
 but i wanted to go to university  
 unfortunately in my country  there wasn 't a dormitory for girls 
 so i was accepted in medical school  but i could not go there  
 so as a result  my father sent me to america  
 i came to america
  i completed my education  while i was completing my education my country was invaded by russia  
 and do you know that at the time i was completing my education  
 i didn 't know what was going on with my family or with my country  there were months years  i didn 't know about it 
 my family was in a refugee camp  
 so as soon as i completed my education
 i brought my family to america  i wanted them to be safe  
 but where was my heart  my heart was in afghanistan  
 day after day when i listened to the news when i followed what was going on with my country  my heart was breaking up  
 i really wanted to go back to my country  
 but at the same time i knew i could not go there 
  for me  
 i had a good job  
 i was a professor at a university 
 i earned good money  i had a good life my family was here  i could live with them  
 but i wasn 't happy  i wanted to go back home  so i went to the refugee camp  
  refugee camp in pakistan there were seven point five million refugees  
 seven point five million refugees about ninety percent of them were women and children  
 most of the men have been killed or they were in war  
 and you know  in the refugee camp  when i went day to day to do a survey i
  you never could imagine  
 i saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping
 and not knowing what to do  
 i saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere  no education no entertainment  no place to even live  
 i saw young men that had lost their father and their
  old boy being the head of the household trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children  
 so it was a very devastating situation  my heart was beating for my people  and i didn 't know what to do at
 that moment  we talk about momentum  
 at that moment  i felt  what can i do for these people  how could i help these people i am one individual
  what can i do for them but at that moment  i knew
 that education changed my life 
 it transformed me  
 it gave me status  it gave me confidence  
 it gave me a career  it helped me to support my family to bring my family to another country  to
  i knew
 that at that moment that what i should give to my people is education and health and that 's what i went after  
 but do you think it was easy 
 no because at that time education was banned for for girls  completely 
 and also by russia invading afghanistan people were not trusting anyone it was very hard to
  say i want to do this who am i 
 somebody who comes from the united states  somebody who got educated here did they trust me  of course not 
 so i really needed to build the trust in this community  how am i going to do that 
 i went and surveyed and looked and looked 
  i found one man  he was eighty years old he was a mullah 
 i went to his tent in the camp  and i asked him i want to make you a teacher 
 and he looked at me and he said crazy woman  crazy woman how do you think i can be a teacher 
 and i told him i will make you a teacher
  and once i started a class in his compound  the word spread all over in
 a matter of one year  we had twenty five schools set up  fifteen thousand children going to school
  giving teacher training we were training women 's rights human rights democracy rule of law  we were giving all kinds of training 
 and one day i tell you 
 one day i was in the office in peshawar pakistan 
 all of a sudden  i saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me
  away  hide 
 and you know  as a leader what do you do 
 you 're scared you know it 's dangerous you know your life is on the line but as a leader you have to hold it together 
 you have to hold it together and show strength  
 so i said what 's going on and these people were pouring into my office  so i invited them to the office  they came
 and there were nine of them nine taliban  they were the ugliest looking men you can ever see 
 very mean looking people  black clothes  black turban  and they pour into my office  
 and i invited them to
 have a seat and have tea  they said
  they are not going to drink tea and of course with the tone of voice they were using  it was very scary  but i was really
 shaking up  but also i was strong holding myself up  
 and of course by that time you know how i dress i dress from head to toe in a black hijab the only thing you could see  my eyes
  they asked me what are you doing don 't you know that school is banned for
  are you doing here 
 and you know  
 i just looked at them  and i said what school where is the school 
 and they look at my face and they said 
 you are teaching girls here i said this is a house of somebody  
 we have some students coming  and they are all learning koran 
  and you know  koran says that if you learn the holy book the woman  they can be a good
 wife  and they can obey their husband 
 and i tell you one thing that 's the way you work with those people and you know 
 so by that time  they started speaking pashto  they talked to each other
 and they said  let 's go leave her alone she 's ok 
 and you know  this time i offered them tea again  and they took a sip and they left 
 by that time  my staff poured into my office  they were scared to death they didn 't know why they didn 't kill
  they didn 't know why they didn 't take me away  but everybody was happy to see me  very happy and i was happy to be alive of course of course
 i was happy to be alive  but also  as we continuously gave training during the fall of the taliban
 of course during the taliban there is another story we went underground and we provided education
 for eighty schoolgirls 
  the fall of the taliban we went into the country  
 and we opened school after school  we opened women 's learning center 
 we continuously opened clinics  we worked with mothers and children  we had reproductive health training we had all kinds of training that you can imagine  
 i was very happy  i was delighted with the outcome of my work and one day with four trainers and one bodyguard  i was going up north
  of kabul  and all of a sudden again  i was stopped in the middle of the road
 by nineteen young men rifles on their shoulders they blocked the road  and i told my
 driver what 's going on and the driver said i don 't know he asked them  they said we have nothing to do with you 
  they called my name  and by that time the women are yelling and screaming
 inside the car  i am very shaken up  and i told myself this is it this time we all are going to be killed  there is no doubt in my mind  
 but still  the moment
  and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do it 's in your heart you believe in 
  walk on it so i just hold myself on the side of the car  my leg was shaking  and i got outside  
 and i asked them what can i do for you 
 you know what they said to me  they said we know who you are we know
  you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job  you build their skills
  so i walked into the car  i sit in the car  and i told the
  turn around and go back to the office 
 at that time we only were supporting girls  we only had money for women to train them to send them to school  and nothing else 
 by the time i came to the office of course my trainers
 were gone  they ran away home  nobody stayed there  my bodyguard was the only one there and my
  am i going to do
 and she asked me sakena and i answered her she said it 's not you  what 's wrong with you i said nothing i tried to cover 
 no matter what i tried to do she didn 't believe me  and she asked me again ok tell me what 's going on i told her
 the whole story at that time she said
  you will help them 
 and when two days later i went the same route  
 and do you know they were not in here  they were a little back further  the same
 young men standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car  so we stopped the car  i got out i said
  that whatever i say you accept it and they said yes they do  so i took them to the mosque  and to make a long story short 
 i told them i 'd give them teachers 
 today  they are the
 best trainers  they learn english  they learn how to be
  that is unknown to us in the mountain areas  they go with me  they are ahead and we go  and they protect us
  today all over we need to work for gender equality  we cannot only train women but forget about the men because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time 
 so we started training men because the men should know the potential of women know
  men has and how much these women can do the same job they are doing  so we are continuously giving training to men  
 and i really believe strongly  i live in a country that was a beautiful country  i just want to share this with you  
 it was a beautiful country  beautiful peaceful country  
 we were going everywhere
  we were going from house to house we never locked our doors  but you know what happened to my country  today people cannot walk
 out of their door without security issues  but we want
 the same afghanistan we had before  and i want to tell you the other side 
  the women of afghanistan are working very very hard  they are earning
 degrees  they are training to be lawyers they are training to be doctors back again  they are training to be teachers and they are running businesses  
 so it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential  
 and all of this is going to happen  i want to share this with you  because of love  because of compassion
  and because of trust and honesty if you have these
 few things with you  you will accomplish  we have one poet mawln rm he said
 that by by having compassion and having love  you can conquer the
  and i tell you we could and if we could do it in afghanistan  i am sure one hundred percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world thank you very
