  right now
 you have a movie playing
 inside your head  it 's an amazing multi track movie  it has 3d vision and surround sound for what you 're seeing and
  hearing right now  but that 's just the start of it your movie has smell and taste and touch  
 it has a sense of your body  pain  hunger  orgasms  
 it has emotions  anger
 and happiness  it has memories like scenes from your childhood playing before you
  voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking 
 at the heart of this movie is you
 experiencing all this directly  this movie is your stream of consciousness
  and the world 
 consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence each of us is conscious  
 we all have our own inner movie you and you and you there
 's nothing we know about more directly at
  at least i know about my consciousness directly  
 i can 't be certain that you guys are conscious consciousness also is what makes life worth living if
 we weren 't conscious nothing
 in our lives
 would have meaning or value  but at the same time it 's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe 
 why are we conscious 
  why do we have these inner movies why aren 't we just
 robots who process all this input  produce all that output  
 without experiencing the inner movie at all right now  nobody knows the answers to those questions  
 i 'm going to suggest
 that to integrate consciousness into science some radical ideas may be
  some people say a science of consciousness
 is impossible 
 science by its nature is objective 
 consciousness by its nature is subjective so there can never be a science of consciousness  
 for much of the 20th century that view held sway  psychologists studied behavior objectively  
 neuroscientists studied the brain objectively  and nobody even mentioned
 consciousness  even thirty years ago  when ted got started there was very little scientific work
 on consciousness now about twenty years ago  all that began to change neuroscientists like francis crick
 and physicists like roger penrose
 said now is the time for science to attack consciousness
  and since then there 's been a real explosion a flowering of scientific work on consciousness and this work has been wonderful it 's been great 
 but it also has some fundamental limitations so far  
 the centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for
  correlations between certain areas of the brain
 and certain states of consciousness  we saw some of this kind of work from nancy kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented
 just a few minutes ago  
 now we understand much better for example the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces
 or of feeling pain
 or of feeling happy  but this is still
  a science of correlations  
 it 's not a science of explanations we know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience  
 but we don 't know why
 they do i like to put this by saying
 that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness
  questions about what certain brain areas do
 and what they correlate with but in a certain sense those are the easy problems  no knock on the neuroscientists there are no truly easy problems with consciousness  
 but it doesn 't
 address
 the real mystery at the core of this
  why is it
 that all that physical processing in a brain
 should be accompanied by consciousness at all why is there this inner subjective movie right now we don 't really have a bead on that and
 you might say  let 's just give neuroscience a few years it 'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon
 like traffic
  'll figure it out 
 the classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior 
 how a traffic jam behaves  how a hurricane functions how a living organism reproduces
 and adapts
 and metabolizes all questions about objective functioning you could apply that to the human brain
 in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as
  emergent phenomena how we walk how we talk  how we play chess all these questions about behavior but when it comes
 to consciousness questions about behavior
 are among the easy problems  when it comes to the hard problem that 's the question of why is it
 that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience and here the standard paradigm of
 emergence even the standard paradigms of neuroscience don 't really so far have that much to say  
 now i 'm a scientific materialist at heart  i want a scientific theory of consciousness
 that works and for a long time  i banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in
  purely physical terms that would work but i eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn 't work for systematic reasons
 it 's a long story  
 but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms in brain based terms is stories about the functioning of a system its structure its dynamics the behavior it produces
  for solving the easy problems how we behave  how we function but when it comes
 to subjective experience why does all this feel like something
 from the inside that 's something fundamentally new  and it 's always a further question  so i think we 're at a
 kind of impasse here we 've got this wonderful
  of explanation we 're used to it where physics
 explains chemistry chemistry
 explains biology biology explains parts of psychology  but consciousness
 doesn 't seem to fit into this picture on the one hand it 's a datum
 that we 're conscious  on the other hand we don 't know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world
  so i think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly 
 one that we need to integrate into our view of the world but we don 't yet see how faced with an anomaly like this radical ideas
 may be needed and i think
 that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically
 now there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be 
 my friend dan dennett  who 's here today has one  his crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness  
 the whole idea of the inner subjective movie
 involves a kind of illusion
 or
  all we 've got to do is explain the objective functions the behaviors of the brain and then we 've explained everything that needs to be explained 
 well i say more power to him that 's the kind of radical idea
 that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reductionist brain based theory of consciousness  at the same time for me and for many other
  that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum
 of consciousness to be satisfactory  so i go in a different direction 
 in the time remaining  i want to explore two crazy ideas that i think may have some promise 
 the first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental  
 physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks space and time
 and mass  they postulate fundamental laws governing them like the laws of gravity
 or of quantum mechanics these fundamental properties and laws aren 't explained in terms of anything more basic 
 rather they 're taken as primitive  and you build up the world from there now sometimes the list of fundamentals expands
 in the 19th century  maxwell figured out that you can 't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals
 space time mass  newton 's laws
 so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge
 as a fundamental
  i think that 's the situation we 're in
 with consciousness  
 if you can 't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals space time  mass  charge then as a matter of logic you need to expand the list 
 the natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental 
 a fundamental building block of nature  this doesn 't mean you suddenly can
  't do science with it this opens up the way for you to do science with it what we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness  
 the laws that connect
 consciousness to other fundamentals space time mass physical processes  physicists sometimes say
 that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a
 well i think something like that is the situation we 're in with consciousness we want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t shirt 
 we don 't know what those laws are yet  but that 's what we 're after 
 the second crazy idea is that consciousness might be
  every system might have some degree of consciousness  
 this view is sometimes called
 pan for all psych for mind  every system is conscious  not just humans  dogs  
 mice  flies but even rob knight 's microbes  elementary particles  
 even a photon has some degree of consciousness  the idea is not that photons are
 intelligent or thinking
 it 's not that a photon is wracked with angst because it 's thinking aww i 'm always buzzing around near the speed of light  i never get to slow down and smell the roses no
 not like that 
 but
 the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw subjective feeling some
  may sound a bit kooky to you  
 i mean why would anyone think such a crazy thing some motivation comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental 
 if it 's fundamental like space and time and mass it
 's natural to suppose that it might be universal too the way they are  
 it 's also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us it 's much less counterintuitive
 to people from different cultures where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature a deeper motivation
 comes from the idea that
 perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing
 is to link consciousness to information wherever there 's information processing there 's consciousness  complex information processing
  like in a human complex consciousness  simple information processing simple consciousness a really exciting thing is in recent years
 a neuroscientist giulio tononi has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously
 with a mathematical theory he has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi  measuring the amount of information integrated
 and he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness  so in a human brain incredibly large amount of information integration  high degree of phi a whole lot of consciousness 
 in a mouse  
 medium degree of information integration still pretty significant pretty serious amount of consciousness  but as you go down to
  the amount of phi falls off  the amount of information integration falls off  but it 's still non zero on tononi 's theory 
 there 's still going to be a non zero degree of consciousness in effect he 's proposing a fundamental law
 of consciousness  high phi  high consciousness now i don 't know if this theory is right  but it 's actually
 perhaps the leading theory
 right now in the science of consciousness and it 's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data  
 and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t shirt 
 another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world  physicists
 and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract it describes the structure of reality using
  a bunch of equations  but it doesn 't
 tell us about the reality that underlies it as stephen hawking puts it 
 what puts the fire into the equations  
 well on the panpsychist view 
 you can leave the equations of physics as they are but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness that 's what physics really is ultimately doing describing the flux of consciousness
 on this view it 's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations  
 on that view consciousness doesn 't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra  it 's there right at its heart 
 this view i think the  panpsychist view has the potential to transfigure our
  and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical
 consequences some of these may be counterintuitive i used to think
 i shouldn 't eat anything which is conscious  so therefore i should be vegetarian  now 
 and you take that view you 're going to go very hungry  so i think when you think about it this
  your views whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations not so much the fact
 of consciousness  but the degree and the complexity of consciousness  
 it 's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems like computers 
 what about the artificially intelligent system in the movie her samantha 
 is she conscious  well if you take
  she certainly has complicated information processing
 and integration  
 so the answer is very likely yes  she is conscious  if that 's right 
 it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off  
 finally you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups 
  does canada
 have its own consciousness  or at a more local level  
 does an integrated group like the audience at a ted conference are we right now having a collective ted consciousness
 an inner movie for this
 collective ted group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts i don 't know the answer to that question but i think it 's at least one worth
  i don 't know that it 's correct  
 i 'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental 
 than about the second one that it 's universal i
 mean the view raises any number of questions has any number of challenges like how do those little bits of consciousness add up
  to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love  
 if we can answer those questions then i think we 're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness  
 if not well this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy we can 't expect to solve it overnight but
 i do think we 're going to figure it out eventually understanding consciousness is a real key i think both to understanding the universe
 and to understanding ourselves it may just take the right crazy idea
