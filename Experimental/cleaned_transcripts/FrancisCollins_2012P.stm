  so let me ask for a show of hands how many people here are over the age of forty eight 
 well there do seem to be a few  
 well congratulations  because if you look at this particular slide of u s life expectancy you are now in excess
  of the average life span of somebody who was born in one thousand nine hundred 
 but look what happened in the course of that century  
 if you follow that curve you 'll see that it starts way down there there 's that dip there for the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen flu  and here we are at two thousand and ten 
 average life expectancy of a child born today age seventy nine and we are not done yet now
 that 's the good news  but there 's still a lot of work to do
  so for instance if you ask how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis  turns out it 's about four thousand which is pretty amazing  
 because most of those molecular discoveries have just happened in the last little while 
 it 's exciting to see that in terms of what we 've learned but how many of those four thousand diseases now have treatments available 
 only about two hundred and fifty  so we have
  this huge challenge this huge gap  
 you would think this wouldn 't be too hard that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we 're learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease
 and build a bridge across this yawning gap between what we 've learned about basic science and its application a bridge that would look maybe something like this
  where you 'd have to put together a nice shiny way to get from one side to the other well 
 wouldn 't it be nice if it was that easy  
 unfortunately it 's not in reality  trying to go from fundamental knowledge to its application is more like this there are no shiny bridges  
 you sort of place your bets maybe you 've got a swimmer and a rowboat and a sailboat and a tugboat and you set them off on their way
  and the rains come and the lightning flashes and oh my gosh there are sharks in the water and
 the swimmer gets into trouble and uh oh the swimmer drowned and the sailboat capsized
 and that tugboat well it hit the rocks and maybe if you 're lucky  somebody gets across well what does this really look like 
 well what is it to make a therapeutic anyway what 's a drug a drug is made up
 of a small molecule of hydrogen carbon
  oxygen nitrogen and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape  
 and it 's those shapes that determine whether in fact that particular drug is going to hit its target is it going to land where it 's supposed to so look at this picture here a lot of shapes dancing around for you 
 now what you need to do if you 're trying to develop a new treatment for autism or alzheimer 's disease
 disease or cancer
 is to find the right shape in that mix that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe  
 and when you look at what happens to that pipeline you start out maybe with thousands tens of thousands of compounds 
 you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail ultimately maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these 
 and if all goes well fourteen years after you started you will get one approval  
 and it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success so we have to look at this
  pipeline the way an engineer would and say how can we do better and that 's the main theme of what i want to say to you this morning how can we make this go faster how can we make it more successful 
 well let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked one that has just happened in the last few months
 is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis
  but it 's taken a long time to get there cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in 
 by my group working with another group in toronto discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene on chromosome seven  
 that picture you see there here it is that 's the same kid  that 's danny bessette
 twenty three years later  because this is the year and it 's also the year where danny got married 
 where we have for the first time the approval by the fda of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic
  fibrosis
 based upon all this molecular understanding that 's the good news  
 the bad news is this drug doesn 't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis and it won 't work for danny and we 're still waiting for that next generation to help him  but it took twenty three years to get this far  that 's too long 
 how do we go faster well one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this
 is the human genome
  the ability to be able to look at a chromosome to unzip it to pull out all the dna  and to be able to then read out the letters in that dna code the a 's c 's g 's and t 's
 that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things and the cost of doing this 
 which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars has in the course of the last ten years fallen faster than moore 's law down to the point where it is less than ten thousand dollars today to have your genome
  sequenced or mine  
 and we 're headed for the $ one thousand genome fairly soon 
 well that 's exciting  how does that play out in terms of application to a disease i want to tell you about another disorder 
 this one is a disorder which is quite rare it 's called
 progeria and it is the most dramatic form of premature
  only about one in every four million kids has this disease 
 and in a simple way  what happens is because of a mutation in a particular gene 
 a protein is made that 's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate
 let me show you a video of what that does to the cell 
 the normal cell  if you looked at it under the microscope would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell which is nice and round and smooth
  its boundaries
 and it looks kind of like that a progeria cell on the other hand because of this toxic protein called progerin has these lumps and bumps in it 
 so what we would like to do after discovering this back in two thousand and three is to come up with a way to try to correct that 
 well again by knowing something about the molecular pathways  it was possible to pick one of those many many compounds
  that might have been useful and try it out in an experiment done in cell culture and and shown here in a cartoon if you take that particular compound
 and you add it to that cell that has progeria and you watch to see what happened in just seventy two hours 
 that cell becomes for all purposes that we can determine
  almost like a normal cell well that was exciting  but would it actually work in a real human being 
 this has led in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial to a test of that very compound 
 and the kids that you see here
 all volunteered to be part of this twenty eight of them and you can see
 as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease all
  quite similar to each other  
 and instead of telling you more about it i 'm going to invite one of them 
 sam berns from boston who 's here this morning to come up on the stage and tell us about his experience
 as a child affected with progeria sam is fifteen years old his parents  scott berns and leslie gordon both physicians are here with us this morning as
  you tell these folks what it 's like being affected with this condition called progeria sam burns well  progeria
 limits me in some ways i cannot play sports or do physical activities  but i have been able to take interest in things that
 progeria luckily does not limit but
  when there is something that i really do want to do that progeria gets in the way of like marching band or umpiring we always find a way to do it and that just shows that progeria isn 't in control of my life francis collins so what would you like
 to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this what would you say to them both about research on progeria and maybe about other conditions as well
  has come so far in less than fifteen years  and
 that just shows the drive that researchers can have
 to get
 this far and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria and it shows that if that drive exists  anybody can cure any disease and hopefully progeria can be cured
 in the near future and so
 we can eliminate those four thousand diseases that francis was talking about fc excellent  
 so sam took the day off from school today to be here and he is he is
 by the way a   straight a + student in the ninth grade in his school in
  so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success
 all over the place for these diseases as sam says
  four thousand that are waiting for answers  
 you might have noticed that the drug that is now in clinical trial for progeria is not a drug that was designed for that it 's such a rare disease it would be hard for a company to justify 
  spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug this is a drug that was developed for cancer  
 't it be great if we could do that more systematically 
 could we in fact encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded 
 in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for now we 're learning about all these new molecular pathways some of those could be repositioned or repurposed or whatever word you want to use 
 old drugs new tricks 
 that could be a phenomenal valuable activity we have many discussions now between nih and companies about doing this that are looking very promising 
 and you could expect quite a lot to come from this 
 there are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances the first drug for hiv aids
  was not developed for hiv aids  it was developed for cancer  it was azt it didn 't work very well for cancer  but became the first successful antiretroviral and you can see from the table there are others as well  
 so how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort well we have to come up with a partnership between academia government the private sector and patient organizations to make that so 
 at nih we have started this new national center for advancing translational sciences it just started last december and this is one of its goals
  let me tell you another thing we could do wouldn 't it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if it 's effective and safe
 without having to put patients at risk because that first time you 're never quite sure  
 how do we know for instance whether drugs are safe before we give them to people we test them on animals  
 and it 's not all that reliable and it 's costly
  suppose we could do this instead on human cells 
 you probably know if you 've been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us  
 so what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it 's going to be safe here you see a picture
 of a lung on a chip this is something created by the wyss institute in boston
  and what they have done here if we can run the little video is to take cells from an individual turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung  
 and determine what would happen if you added to this various drug compounds to see if they are toxic or safe you can see this chip even breathes  
 it has an air channel  it has a blood channel
  and it has cells in between that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound are those cells happy or not 
 you can do this same kind of chip technology for kidneys for hearts for muscles all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem for the liver 
 and ultimately  because you can do this for the individual we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines
 will be you on a chip what we 're trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety 
 so let me sum up 
 we are in a remarkable moment here 
 for me at nih now for almost twenty years there has never been a time where there was more excitement about the potential that lies in front of us 
 we have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world what do we need to capitalize on this first of all we need resources this is research
  sometimes high cost the payoff is enormous both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth we need to support that 
 second we need new kinds of partnerships between academia and government and the private sector and patient organizations just like the one i 've been describing here in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds 
 and third  and maybe most important  we need
  we need the best and the brightest from many different disciplines to come and join this effort all ages all different groups because this is the time folks this is the 
  biology that you 've been waiting for and we have the chance to take that and turn it into something which will in fact knock out disease  that 's my goal 
  i hope that 's your goal i think it 'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage
  and think about what we 're trying to do here and why it matters it matters for now it matters as soon as possible if you don 't believe me just ask sam  thank you all very much
