  having spent
 eighteen years as a child of the state in children 's homes and foster care  you could say that i 'm an expert on the subject  
 and in being an expert i want to let you know that being an expert
 does in no way
 make you right
 in light of the truth  
 if you 're in care  legally the government is your parent loco parentis  
 margaret thatcher was my mother 
 laughter let 's not talk about breastfeeding 
 harry potter was a foster child
  expectations was adopted  superman was a foster child
  cinderella was a foster child
  lisbeth salander the girl with the dragon tattoo was fostered and institutionalized batman was orphaned
  the boys in michael morpurgo 's friend
  alem in benjamin zephaniah 's refugee boy luke skywalker
 luke skywalker oliver twist  cassia in the concubine of shanghai by hong ying
 celie in in alice walker 's the color purple all of these great fictional characters all of them
 who were hurt by their condition all of them
 who spawned thousands of other books and other films all of them
 were fostered  adopted
 or orphaned it seems that writers know that the child outside of family
 reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself
  to be 
 that is 
 they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis 
 how have we not made the connection  and why have we not made the connection between
 between these incredible characters of popular culture and
  religions  and the fostered adopted or orphaned child in our midst it 's not our pity that they need  
 it 's our respect  
 i know famous musicians i know
 actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national
  journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers all who were looked after children fostered  adopted or orphaned and many of them grow into their adult lives in 
 fear of speaking of their background as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground as if it were somehow kryptonite
  as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside children in care  who 've had a life in care  deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood 
 it is that simple my own mother
 and i should say this here she same to this country in
 in the late '
  they found themselves pregnant and she sort of she had no idea of the context in which she 'd landed 
 in the 1960s i should give you some context in the 1960s if you were pregnant and you were single you were seen as a
  you were separated from your family
 by the state you were separated from your family and placed into
 mother and baby homes you were appointed a social worker  
 the adoptive parents were lined up  it was the primary purpose of the social worker  the aim to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life to sign the adoption
  papers  so the adoption papers were signed  the mother and baby 's homes were often run by nuns the adoption papers were signed
 the child was given to the adoptive parents and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she 'd been on a little break  
 a little break
 of shame for a woman for being a woman a little break 
 the adoption process took like a matter of months  so it was a closed shop
  it 's kind of easy to patronize the past to forego our responsibilities
 in the present what happened then is a direct reflection
 of what is happening now everybody believed
  themselves to be doing the right thing by god and by the state for the big society
  at the time under the emperor haile selassie  and
 she lands months before the enoch powell speech the rivers of blood speech she lands months before
 the beatles release the white album 
 months before martin luther king was killed it was a summer of love if you were white if you were black it was a summer of hate
  from oxford 
 she 's sent to the north of england to a mother and baby home and appointed a social worker  it 's her plan you know i
 have to say this in the houses
 it 's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies  but the
  they took me  i was a
  i was a sign from god they said  i was norman mark greenwood 
 now for the next eleven years all i know is that this woman this birth woman should have her eyes scratched out for not signing the adoption papers she was an evil woman too selfish to sign so i spent those eleven years kneeling and praying  
 i tried praying i swear i tried
  and then i was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of god or it was the voice of the devil and it turns out
 i 've got the devil inside of me who
  so anyway two years sort of passed and they had a child of their own and then another two years passed and they had another child of their own and then another
 time passed and they had another child that they called an accident which i thought was an unusual name 
 and i was on the cusp of sort of adolescence  so i was starting to take biscuits from the tin without
 without asking i was starting to stay out a little bit late etc
  religiosity in their naivete  my mom and dad which i believed them to be forever as they said they were  my mom and dad
 conceived that that i had the devil inside of me  
 and what i should say this here because this is how they engineered my leaving  they sat me at a table
  my foster mom and she said to me you don 't love us do you at eleven years old  they 've had three other children i 'm the fourth the third was an accident  and i said yeah of course i do because you do 
 my foster mother asked me to go away to think about love and what it is and to read the scriptures and to come back tomorrow and give my most honest and truthful answer 
 so this was an opportunity
  if they were asking me whether i loved them or not then i mustn 't love them which led me to the miracle of thought that i thought they wanted me to get to i will ask god for forgiveness and
  his light will shine through me to them  how fantastic this was an opportunity  the theology was perfect  the timing unquestionable  and the answer as honest as a sinner could get i mustn 't love you i said to them 
 but i will ask god for forgiveness because you don 't love us norman  clearly you 've chosen your path 
  my social worker this strange man who used to visit me
 every couple of months he 's waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents  i didn 't say goodbye to anybody 
 not my mother my father my sisters my brothers my aunts my uncles my cousins my grandparents 
 nobody 
 on the way to the children 's home i started to ask myself what 's happened to me it
 's not that i 'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away
 when i got to the
 for the next
 four five years i was held in four different children 's homes
  on the third children 's home at fifteen
  i started to rebel  and what i did was i got three tins of paint airfix paint that you use for models
  and i was it was a big children 's home big victorian children 's home and i was in a little turret at the top of it and i poured them  red yellow and green the colors of africa 
 down the tiles  
 you couldn 't see it from the street because the home was surrounded by beech trees for doing this i was incarcerated
 for a year in an assessment
  center which was actually a remand center  it was a virtual prison for young people
 by the way years later my social worker said that i should never have been put in there i wasn 't charged for anything i hadn 't done anything wrong but because i had no family to inquire about me  
 they could do anything to me
  seventeen years old  and
 they had a padded cell they would march me down corridors in  last size order 
 they
 i was put in a dormitory with a confirmed nazi sympathizer
  man who ran it was an ex army officer 
 every time i had a visit by a person who i did not know who would feed me grapes  once every three months  i was 
 that home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder
  and this was the preparation
 that i was being given after seventeen years
 as a child of the state  i have to tell this story
  i have to tell it because there was no one to put two and two together 
 i slowly became aware that i knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year see that 's what family does
  it gives you reference points  
 i 'm not defining a good family from a bad family i 'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is a mother a father a sister a brother an aunt an uncle a cousin a grandparent it matters to someone and therefore it matters to you understand
  i was fourteen years old tucked away in myself  into myself  and i wasn
  i 'm reporting back i 'm reporting back simply to say
 that when i left the children 's home i had two things that i wanted to do one
 was to find my family and the other was to write poetry in creativity i saw light in the imagination i saw
  the place where anger was an expression in the search for love a place where dysfunction
 is a true reaction to untruth i 've just got to say it to you all i found all of my family in my adult life i spent all
  of my adult life finding them and i 've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else
