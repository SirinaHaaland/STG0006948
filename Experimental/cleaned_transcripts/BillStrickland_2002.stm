  it 's
 a great honor to be here with you the good news is i 'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here
 because i 'm the only thing standing between you and
  i 've learned through experience that people remember pictures long after they 've forgotten words and so i hope
 you 'll remember some of the pictures i 'm going to share with you for
 just a few
 whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in
 pittsburgh pennsylvania in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead  
 and on a wednesday afternoon i was walking down the corridor of my
 high school kind of
  vessel and i happened to be looking in the door of the art room and if you 've ever seen clay done it 's magic
 and i 'd never seen anything like that before in my life  
 so i walked in the art room and i said  what is that and he said ceramics and who are you and
 i said i 'm bill strickland i want you to teach me that and he said well 
 get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can
  to you and so for the remaining two years of my high school i cut all my classes 
 but i had the presence of mind to give the teachers ' classes that i cut the pottery that i made 
 and they gave me passing grades and that 's how i got out of high school
  i 'm leaving this school and i 'm taking you with me and he drove me out to the university of pittsburgh where i filled out a college application and got in on probation  
 well i 'm now a trustee of the university  and at my installation ceremony i said i 'm the guy who
 came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation don 't give up on the poor kids because you never know what 's going to happen to those children
 in life what i 'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a
 facility that i built in the toughest neighborhood in pittsburgh with the highest crime rate 
 one is called bidwell training center  it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers
  remember we used to make steel in pittsburgh well we don 't make any steel anymore and the people who used to make the steel
 are having a very tough time of it and i rebuild them and give them new life
 manchester craftsmen 's guild is named after my neighborhood i
 was adopted by the bishop of the episcopal
  house i started manchester craftsmen 's guild and i learned very quickly
 that wherever there are episcopalians there 's money in very close proximity 
 and the bishop
 adopted me as his kid  and last year i spoke at his memorial service and wished him
 i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright the architect and i asked him to build me a world class center in
 the worst neighborhood in pittsburgh and my building was a scale model for the pittsburgh airport and when you come to pittsburgh and you 're all invited
 you 'll be flying into the blown up version of my building that
  the building built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead
  my view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on you
 have to look like the solution and not the problem as you can see it has a fountain in the courtyard
  i got put on the board of the carnegie museum  at a reception in their courtyard i noticed that they had a fountain
 because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain well i think that welfare mothers
  deserve a fountain in their life and so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you water is life and
 water of human possibility and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people
 before you ever give them a speech so from
  and everywhere your eye turns there 's something beautiful
  and i hired a japanese cabinetmaker from kyoto japan  and commissioned him to do sixty pieces of furniture for our building  
 we have since spun him off into his own business
  he 's making a ton of money
 doing custom furniture for rich people and i got sixty pieces out of it for my school
 because i felt that welfare moms and ex steel workers and single parents
 deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day 
 because it sets a tone and an attitude
  feel about people
 long before you give them the speech  we even have flowers in the hallway and they 're not plastic those are real
 and they 're in my building every day 
 and now that i 've given lots of speeches we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me 
 and they said mr strickland what an extraordinary story and what a great school 
 and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got
 car and i went out to the greenhouse and i bought them and i brought them back and i put them there you don 't need a task force or a study group
 to buy flowers for your kids
 what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life the cost is
  we believe in hope and human possibilities that happens to be at christmas time 
 and so the next thing you 'll see is a million dollar kitchen that was
 had heard about my desire to build a new building  because i had a cardboard box and i put it in a garbage bag and i walking all over pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site and
 he called me into his office which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of oz and
 john heinz had six hundred million dollars and at the time i had about sixty cents and he said
 we 've heard about you we 've heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers and we 're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building 
 and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program
 to your program because back then we were building a trades program he said 
 that way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the heinz company i said senator 
 i 'm reluctant
 to go into a field that i don 't know much about but i promise you that if you 'll support my school i 'll get it built and in a couple of years i 'll come back
 and weigh out that program that you desire and senator heinz
 sat very quietly and he said well what would your reaction be if i said i 'd give you a million dollars
  and john heinz did give me a million bucks and most importantly  he loaned me the head of research for the heinz company and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the
 culinary institute of america which in their mind is kind of the harvard of cooking schools  and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers
 in this million dollar kitchen
 in the middle of the inner city and we 've never looked back i would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do
 in this million dollar kitchen that happens to be our cafeteria line  that 's puff pastry day  why because the students made puff pastry and that
  school ate every day  but the concept was that i wanted to take the stigma out of food 
 that good food 's not for rich people good food 's for everybody on the planet  and there 's no excuse why we all can 't be eating it so at my school  
 we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of
 the inner city because we 've discovered that it 's good for their
  i wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place i call my center we
 have students who sit together black kids and white kids and what we 've discovered is
 you can solve the race problem by creating
 a world class environment because people will have a tendency
 to show you world class behavior
  if you treat them in that way these are examples of
 the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months
 in the training program 
 no sophistication  no class no dignity  no history what we 've discovered is the only thing wrong with
  have any money which happens to be a curable condition it 's all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior 
 that was done by a student after seven months in the program 
 done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef i 've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they 're very good
  it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in america but this is my 
  once they have been pushed aside  
 we train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry  we train medical technicians for the medical industry
 and we train chemical
  technicians for companies like bayer and calgon carbon and fisher scientific and exxon  and i will guarantee
 you that if you come to my center in pittsburgh and you 're all invited
 you 'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators
 ten months from enrolling in the program there is absolutely no reason
  poor people can 't learn world class technology what we 've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food
 and expectations and herbie 's music 
 and you can cure a spiritual cancer
 every time we train corporate travel
  and i have children with high school diplomas that they can 't read  and so you must ask yourself the question
 that we graduate children from schools who can 't read the diplomas that they
 reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end 
 not the children who read  
 i can take these children and in twenty weeks demonstrated aptitude  i can get them high school equivalent 
 no big deal
  life saved with ceramics well i went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood the theory being
 if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm you can bring them right back to life i have four hundred
  public school system that come to me every day of the week
 for arts education  and these are children who are flunking out of public school 
 and last year i put eighty eight percent of those kids in college and i 've averaged over eighty percent for
 fifteen years we 've made a fascinating discovery there 's nothing wrong
  and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and
 herbie 's music can 't cure for that i won a big old plaque man of the year in education i beat out all
 the ph d ' s
 because i figured that if you treat children like human beings it increases the likelihood they 're going to behave that way 
 and why we can 't institute that policy
 in every school and in every city and every town
 remains a mystery to me 
 let me show you what these people do we have ceramics and photography and computer imaging  and these are all kids with no artistic ability  
 no talent no imagination  and we bring in the world 's greatest artists gordon parks
  chester higgins has been there and what we 've learned is
 that the children will become like the people who teach them in fact i brought in a mosaic artist from the vatican
 woman who had studied the old vatican mosaic techniques  and let me show you what they did with the work 
 these were children who the whole world had given up on who were flunking out of public school and that
  with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence we
 teach photography 
 and these are examples of some of the kids ' work  
 that boy won a
  class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery 
 so i designed this thing 
 we have smoked salmon at the art openings we have a formal printed invitation  and i even have figured out a way to get their parents to come 
 i couldn 't buy a parent fifteen years ago
 so i hired a guy who got off on the jesus
  was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the lord and i said bill i want to
 hire you man you have to tone down the jesus stuff a little bit but keep the enthusiasm 
 i can 't get these parents to come to the school he said i 'll get them to come to the school 
 so he jumped in the van he went to miss jones ' house and said miss jones
  your kid 's art opening
 but you probably didn 't have a ride so i came to give you a ride and
 he got ten parents and then twenty parents at the last show that we did two hundred parents showed up
 and we didn 't pick up one parent because now it 's become socially not acceptable
 not to show up to support your children at the manchester craftsmen 's guild because people
  the white parents and the black parents mothers will go
 where their children are being celebrated every time every town every city 
 i
 wanted you to see this gallery because it 's as good as it gets and by the time i cut these kids loose from high school they
  've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it 's all up here 
 you have to change the way that people see themselves before
 you can change their behavior and it 's worked out pretty good up to this
 day i even stuck
  another room on the building which i 'd like to show you this is brand new  we just got this slide done in time for the ted conference 
 i gave this little slide show at a place called the silicon valley
 and i did all right and the woman came out of the audience she said that
 was a great story and i was very impressed with your presentation my only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old
  there 's an easy solution to that problem well i 'm very pleased to announce to you that hp
 and a furniture company called steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the united states of america  
 and that 's the room
 we got it just done in time
 to show you so it 's kind of the world debut
 of our digital imaging center i only
 have a couple more slides and this is where the story gets kind of interesting  
 so i just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes
  and you 'll understand
 why he 's there and i 'm here in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six i had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while i was building it 
 and a guy named dizzy gillespie showed up
 to play there because he knew this man over here  marty
  and i stood on that stage with dizzy gillespie on sound check
 on a wednesday afternoon and i said dizzy  why would you come to a black run center
 in the middle of an industrial park with a
 high crime rate that doesn 't even have a reputation in music he said because i heard you built the center and i didn 't believe that you did it and
 i wanted to see for myself and now that i have 
 i want to give you a gift
 and i 'm going to allow you to record the concert and i 'm going to give you the music and
 if you ever choose to sell it you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school and i
 recorded dizzy  and he died a year later  but not before telling a fellow named mccoy tyner
 then a bass player named ray brown and a fellow named stanley turrentine 
 and a piano player named herbie hancock
 and
 a band called the count basie orchestra and
  carter and dakota staton and nancy wilson all have come to this center
 in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city and i 'm very pleased to tell you that with
 their permission i have now accumulated six hundred recordings
 of the greatest artists in the
  joe williams came up to me
 and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said
  and that worked out all right when the basie band came the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the
 rights to the music and i recorded it and we won something called a grammy and
 like a fool i didn 't go
  madison square garden then the u n 
 jazz orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second grammy back to back so 
 we 've become one of the hot young jazz recording studios in the united states of america 
 in the middle of the inner city with a high crime
 that 's the place all filled up with
 republicans
 and there 's dizzy  just like i told you he was there and he was there tito puente and pat metheny and
 jim hall were there and they recorded with us and
 that was our first recording studio which was the broom closet we put the mops in the hallway and re engineered
  thing and that 's where we recorded the first grammy
  and this is our new facility which is all video technology and that is a room that was built for a woman named nancy wilson 
 who
 recorded that album at our school
 last christmas and any of you who happened to have been watching oprah winfrey on christmas day  he was there and nancy
 was there singing excerpts from this album the rights to which she donated to our school and i can now tell you with absolute certainty
 that an appearance on oprah winfrey will sell ten thousand cds 
 laughter we
 are currently number four on the billboard charts right behind tony bennett  and i think we 're going to be fine this was burned out during the riots this is
  and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out in the streets again  
 and that 's the building  and that 's the model and on the right 's a high tech greenhouse and in the middle 's the medical technology building and i 'm very pleased to tell you
 that the building 's done it 's also full of anchor tenants at twenty dollars a foot triple that in the middle of the inner city  and
  every building has a fountain 
 and the university of pittsburgh medical center are anchor tenants and they took half the building  and we now train medical technicians through all their system and mellon bank 's a tenant and
 i love them because they pay the rent on time 
 and as a result of the association i 'm now a director of the mellon financial corporation
  and this is in the process of being built as we speak multiply that picture times four
 and you will see the greenhouse that 's going to open in october this year because we 're going to
 grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city and we 're going to have high school kids
 growing
 phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city and we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids
 in all two hundred and forty stores
 in six states
 and our partners are zuma canyon orchids of malibu california  who are hispanic so the hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership
 to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city
  my united states senator that there was a very high probability
 that if he could find some funding for this we would become a left hand column in the wall street journal to which he readily agreed and we got the funding and we open in the fall
  my big mistake i had a chance to buy this whole industrial park which is less than one thousand feet from the riverfront
 for four million dollars and i didn 't do it
 and i built the first building and guess what happened i appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody 's expectations
 and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars
 last year
  and said mr strickland  
 you ought to get the civic leader of the year award because you 've appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations  
 thank you very much for that 
 the moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams  just in case they do come true 
 and finally there 's this picture
  this is in a place called san francisco
 and the reason this picture 's in here is
 i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit and
 there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me he said man that 's a great story  i want
 one
  and so i kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind and that weekend i was going back home
 and herbie hancock was playing our center that night first time i 'd met him and he walked in and he says
  a matter of fact he did know willie
  and willie brown and herbie and i
 had dinner four years ago and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth and
 willie brown said as sure as i 'm the mayor of san francisco  i 'm going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people
 of this city and he got me five acres of land on san francisco bay
 and we got an architect and we got a general contractor
 and we got herbie on the board  and our friends from hp and our friends from steelcase
  and our friends from cisco and our friends from wells fargo and genentech and along the way i met this real short guy
 at my slide show in the silicon valley he came up to me afterwards he said man that 's a fabulous story
  i want to help you
  thanks very much and give me your card and sometime we 'll talk i didn 't know ebay from that
 jar of water sitting on that piano  but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center i said
 and he left me his card so i called him up on the phone and i said 
  come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are
  and he 's organized a team of people and we 're going to build this center 
 and i went down into the neighborhood
 called bayview hunters point  and i said  the mayor sent me down here to work with you
 and i want to build a center with you but i 'm not going to build you anything if you
  of slides 
 and so i stood up in front of two hundred very angry very disappointed people on a summer night and the air conditioner had broken
 and it was one hundred degrees outside
 and i started showing these pictures and after about ten pictures they all settled down
  and in the back of the room a woman stood up and she said in thirty five years of living in this god forsaken place you
 're the only person that 's come down here and treated us with dignity  
 i 'm going with you man 
 and she turned that audience around on a pin and
 i promised these people that i was going to build this thing and we 're going to build it all right and i think we can get in the ground this year
 as the first replication of the center in pittsburgh
 but i met
 a guy named quincy jones along the way and i showed him the box of slides and
 quincy said i want to help you man  
  and i 've fallen in love with him as i have with herbie and with his music and quincy said where did the idea
 for centers like this come from and i said it came from your music man 
 because mr ross used to bring in your albums when i was sixteen years old in the pottery class 
  when the world was all dark and your music got
  i think we can get
