  the final frontier 
 i first heard these words when i was just six years old  and i was completely inspired  
 i wanted to explore strange new worlds i wanted to seek out new life i wanted to see everything that the universe had
  to offer 
 and those dreams those words they took me on a journey a journey of discovery  
 through school through university to do a phd and finally to become a professional astronomer  
 now i learned
 two amazing things one slightly unfortunate when i was doing my phd  
 i learned that the reality was i wouldn 't be piloting a starship
  anytime soon  
 but i also learned that the universe is strange wonderful and vast actually too vast to be explored by spaceship 
 and so i turned my attention to astronomy to using telescopes  now  i show you before you
 an image of the night sky  you might see it anywhere in the world and all of these stars are part of our local galaxy the milky way
  to go to a darker part of the sky  a nice dark site perhaps in the desert  
 you might see the center of our milky way galaxy spread out before you hundreds of billions of stars 
 and it 's a very beautiful image  it 's colorful and again this is just a local corner of our universe  
 you can see there 's a sort of strange dark dust across it now that is local dust that 's obscuring the light of the stars
 but we can do a pretty good job just with our own eyes we can explore our little corner of the universe  it 's possible to do better you can use
 wonderful telescopes like the hubble space telescope  
 now astronomers have put together this image it 's called the hubble deep field 
 and they 've spent hundreds of hours observing just a tiny patch of the sky no larger than your thumbnail held at arm 's length 
 and in this image you can see thousands of
  galaxies and we know that there must be hundreds of millions billions of galaxies in the entire universe  some like our own and some very different  
 so you think ok  well  i can continue this journey this is easy i can just use a very powerful telescope
 and just look at the sky no problem it 's actually
 really missing out if we if we just do that now
  that 's because everything i 've talked about so far is just using the visible spectrum just the thing that your eyes can see  
 and that 's a tiny slice a tiny tiny slice of what the universe has to offer us  
 now  there 's also two very important problems with using visible light not only are we missing out on all the other processes that are emitting
 other kinds of light  but there 's two issues  now  the first is that dust that i mentioned earlier  the dust stops the visible light from getting
  to us  so as we look deeper into the universe  we see less light the dust stops it getting to us 
 but there 's a really strange problem with using visible light in order to try and explore the universe  
 now
 take a break for a minute  say you 're standing on a corner a busy street corner there 's cars going by
  the siren appeared to change in pitch as it moved towards and away from you the ambulance driver did not change the siren just to mess with you 
 that was a product of your perception  
 the sound waves as the ambulance approached were compressed and they changed higher in pitch as the ambulance receded the sound waves were stretched  and they sounded
  lower in pitch  the same thing happens with light 
 objects moving towards us their light waves are compressed and they appear bluer objects moving away from us 
 their light waves are stretched and they appear redder so we call these effects 
 and redshift  now  our universe is expanding so everything is moving away from everything else
  else  and that means everything appears to be red 
 and oddly enough as you look more deeply into the universe  more distant objects are moving away further and faster  
 so they appear more red 
 so if i come back to the hubble deep field
 and we were to continue to peer deeply into the universe just using the hubble as we get to a certain distance away everything
  becomes red and that presents something of a problem eventually we get so far away everything is shifted into the infrared
 and we can 't see anything at all 
 so there must be a way around this otherwise  i 'm limited in my journey  i wanted to explore the whole universe not just whatever i can see you know 
 before the redshift kicks in 
 there is a technique it 's called radio astronomy
  astronomers have been using this for decades it 's a fantastic technique i show you the parkes radio telescope affectionately known as the dish you may have seen the movie
  and radio is really brilliant it allows us to peer much more deeply  it doesn 't get stopped by dust  so you can see everything in the universe  and redshift is less of a problem because
 we can build receivers that receive across a large band  so what does parkes see when we turn it to the center of the milky way we should see something fantastic right 
 well we do see something interesting all that dust has gone as i mentioned radio goes straight through dust so not a problem 
 but the view is very different  we can see that the center of the milky way is aglow and this isn 't starlight 
 this is a light called synchrotron radiation
  and it 's formed from electrons spiraling around cosmic magnetic fields  
 so the plane is aglow with this light  
 and we can also see strange tufts coming off of it and objects which don 't appear to line up with anything that we can see with our own eyes  
 but it 's hard to really interpret this image because as you can see it 's very low resolution radio waves have a wavelength that 's long  and that
  makes their resolution poorer this image is also black and white  so
 we don 't really know what is the color of everything in here 
 well fast forward to today  we can build telescopes which can get over these problems 
 now i 'm showing you here an image of the murchison radio observatory a fantastic place to build radio telescopes it
 's flat  it 's dry  and most importantly  it 's radio quiet
  quiet  no mobile phones no wi fi nothing just very very radio quiet so a perfect place to build a radio telescope  
 now  the telescope that i 've been working on for a few years is called the murchison widefield array and i 'm going to show you a little time lapse of it being built this is a group of undergraduate 
  and postgraduate students located in perth  we call them the student army  
  their time to build a radio telescope there 's no course credit for this  
 and they 're putting together these radio dipoles they just receive at low frequencies a bit like your fm radio or your tv 
 and here we are deploying them across the desert  the final telescope covers ten square kilometers of the western australian desert  
 and the interesting thing is there 's no moving parts we just deploy these little
  antennas essentially on chicken mesh it 's fairly cheap 
 cables take the signals from the the antennas and bring them to central processing units  
 and it 's the size of this telescope the fact that we 've built it over the entire desert that gives us a better resolution than parkes  
 now eventually all those cables bring them to a unit which sends it off to a supercomputer here
  in perth  and that 's where i come in 
 radio data  
 i have spent the last five years working with very difficult very interesting data that no one had really looked at before i 've spent a long time calibrating it running millions of 
 on supercomputers and really trying to understand that
  very excited this survey is just about to be published but it hasn 't been shown yet so you are literally the first people to see this southern survey of the entire sky  
 so i 'm delighted to share with you some images from this survey
 now imagine you went to the murchison you camped out underneath the stars and you looked towards the south  you saw the south 's celestial pole the galaxy rising if i fade in the radio light this is what we observe with our survey  
 you can see that the galactic plane is no longer dark with dust it 's alight with synchrotron radiation 
 and thousands of dots are in the sky  our large magellanic cloud our nearest
 galactic neighbor is orange instead of its more familiar blue white so there 's a lot going on in this let 's take a closer look 
 if we look back towards the galactic center 
 where we originally saw the the parkes image that i showed you earlier  low resolution black and white and we fade to the gleam view  
 you can see the
  resolution has gone up by a factor of a hundred we now have a color view of the sky  a technicolor view  now it 's not
 a false color view these are real radio colors 
 what i 've done is i 've colored the lowest frequencies red and the highest frequencies blue and the middle ones green  
 and that gives us this rainbow view  and this isn 't just false color the colors in this image tell us about the physical processes going on in the universe  
 so for instance
  if you look along the plane of the galaxy  it 's alight with synchrotron which is mostly reddish orange but if we look very closely we see little blue dots  
 now if we zoom in these blue dots are ionized plasma around very bright stars 
 and what happens is that they block the red light  so they appear blue  
 and these can tell us about these
  and we just see them immediately we look at the galaxy and the color tells us that they 're there 
 you can see little soap bubbles little circular images around the galactic plane and these are supernova remnants 
 when a star explodes its outer shell is cast off and it travels outward into space gathering up material 
 and it produces a little shell 
  astronomers
 where all the supernova remnants are 
 we know that there must be a lot of  high energy electrons in the plane to produce the synchrotron radiation that we see and we think they 're produced by supernova remnants but there don 't seem to be enough 
 fortunately gleam is really really good at detecting supernova remnants so we 're hoping to have a new paper out on that soon 
 now that 's fine
  explored our little local universe but i wanted to go deeper i wanted to go further i wanted to go beyond the milky way  
 well as it happens we can see a very interesting object in the top right  and this is a local radio galaxy  centaurus  a 
 if we zoom in on this we can see that there are two huge plumes going out into space 
 and if you look right in the center between those two plumes you 'll see a galaxy just like our own
  a spiral it has a dust lane
 it 's a normal galaxy  but these these jets are only visible in the radio if we looked in the visible we wouldn 't even know they were there  
 and they 're thousands of times larger than the host galaxy  
 what 's going on what 's producing these jets 
 at the center of every
  galaxy that we know about
 is a supermassive black hole  now black holes are invisible that 's why they 're called that all you can see is the deflection of the light around them 
 and occasionally when a star or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit it is ripped apart by tidal forces  
 forming what we call an accretion disk 
 the accretion disk glows brightly in the x rays and huge magnetic fields can launch the material into space
 at nearly the speed of light
 so these jets are visible in the radio
 and this is what we pick up in our survey well
 very well so we 've seen one radio galaxy 
 that 's nice  but if you just look at the top of that image you 'll see another radio galaxy  it 's a little bit smaller and that 's just because it 's further away  
 ok two
  radio galaxies we can see this this is fine  well what about all the other dots presumably those are just stars 
 they 're not they 're all radio galaxies every single one of the dots in this image
 is a distant galaxy  millions to billions of light years away with a supermassive black hole at its center
 pushing material into space at nearly the speed of light  it is
  and this survey is even larger than what i 've shown here if we zoom out to the full extent of the survey  you can see i found three hundred thousand of these radio galaxies  
 so it 's truly
 epic journey we 've discovered all of these galaxies right back to the very first supermassive black holes i
 'm very proud of this and it will be published next week 
  that 's not all i 've
 explored the furthest reaches of the galaxy with this survey  but there 's something even more in this image 
 now i 'll take you right back to the dawn of time when the universe formed it was a big bang  
 which left the universe as a sea of hydrogen neutral hydrogen  
 and when the very first stars and galaxies switched on they ionized that hydrogen  so the universe went
 from neutral to ionized that imprinted a signal
 all around us everywhere it pervades us like the force  now  because that happened so long ago  
 the signal was redshifted 
 so now that signal is at very low frequencies  it 's at the same frequency as my survey  but it 's so faint  it 's a billionth
  the size of any of the objects in my survey 
 so our telescope may not be quite sensitive enough to pick up this signal 
 however there 's a new radio telescope 
 so i can 't have a starship but i can hopefully have one of the biggest radio telescopes in the world  we 're building the square kilometre array a new radio telescope
  and it 's going to be a thousand times bigger than the mwa a thousand times more sensitive and have an even better resolution so we should find tens of millions of galaxies 
 and perhaps deep in that signal i will get to look upon the very first stars and galaxies switching on the beginning of time itself
