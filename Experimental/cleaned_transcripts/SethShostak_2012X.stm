  i work at the seti institute that 's almost my name seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence in other words i look for aliens  and when i tell people that at a cocktail party 
 they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face i try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate
 now a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic  
 ridiculous maybe even hopeless  but i just want to talk to you a little bit about why i think that the job i have is actually a privilege
 okay and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work if that 's what you call it this thing whoops can we go back
  this is the owens valley radio observatory behind the sierra nevadas and in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight i was working there collecting data for my thesis now it 's kinda lonely it 's kinda tedious 
 just collecting data so i would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescopes or even of myself because you
  the observatory had just acquired a new book written by a russian cosmologist by the name of joseph shklovsky and then expanded and translated and edited by a little known cornell astronomer by the name of carl sagan  
 and i remember reading that book and at three in the morning i was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas i was using to measure the the spins of galaxies
 could also be
  used to communicate to send bits of information from one star system to another now at three o 'clock in the morning when you 're all alone haven 't had much sleep that was a very romantic idea  
  but it was that idea the fact that you could in fact prove that there 's somebody out there just using this same technology
 i took a job at the seti institute now i have to say that my memory is
 notoriously porous  and i 've often wondered whether there was any truth in this story or i was just  you know misremembering something  but i recently just blew up this old negative of mine and sure enough there you can see the shklovsky and sagan book underneath that analog calculating device  
 so it was true all right now the idea for doing this it wasn 't very old at the time that i made that photo the idea
  a young astronomer by the name of frank drake used this antenna in west virginia pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on e t 
 now frank didn 't hear anything  actually he did but it turned out to be the u s air force which doesn 't count as extraterrestrial intelligence
  but
 drake 's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing and i 'll get back to that and
  on the basis of this experiment which didn 't succeed we have been doing seti ever since not continuously but ever since  we still haven 't heard anything  we still haven 't heard anything  
 in fact we don 't know about any life beyond earth  but
 i 'm going to suggest to you that that 's going to change rather soon and part of the reason in fact the majority of the reason why i think that 's going to change is that the equipment 's getting better this is the allen telescope array about three hundred and fifty miles from whatever seat you 're in right now  
 this is something that we 're using today to search for e t and the electronics
  gotten very much better too this is frank drake 's electronics in one thousand nine hundred and sixty this is the allen telescope array electronics today some pundit with
 too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately one hundred trillion times better than they were in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one hundred trillion times better
  that 's a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card  okay  
 but something that 's not appreciated
  by the public is in fact that the experiment continues to get better and consequently  tends to get faster this is a little plot and every time you show a plot you lose ten percent of the audience  i have twelve of these 
 what i plotted here is just some metric that shows how fast we 're searching in other words  we 're looking for a
  in a haystack we know how big the haystack is it 's the galaxy  but
 we 're going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader because of this increase in speed  in fact those of you who are still conscious and mathematically
 competent will note that this is a  semi log plot  
 in other words  the rate of increase is exponential it 's exponentially improving now exponential is an overworked word you hear it on the media all the time they don 't really know what exponential means but this is exponential in fact
  it 's doubling every eighteen months and of course every  card carrying member of the digerati knows that that 's moore 's law so this means that over the course of the next two dozen years we 'll be able 
  to look at a million star systems a million star systems looking for signals that would prove somebody 's out there well a million star systems is that interesting i mean  how many of those star systems have planets 
  ago and in fact we really didn 't know it even as recently as six months ago  
 but now we do recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets and more than one they 're like  you know
  kittens you get a litter you don 't get one kitten you get a bunch   so in fact this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of
 planets
  and i remind the non astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of one hundred billion that we can see with our telescopes  that 's a lot of real estate but of course most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless like  you know  mercury or neptune neptune 's probably not very big in your life
  so the question is  what fraction
 of these planets are actually suitable for life we don 't know the answer to that either but we will learn that answer this year thanks to nasa 's kepler space telescope
 and in fact  the smart money which is to say the people who work on this project  the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe
 one in a thousand 
 one in a hundred something like that well even taking the pessimistic estimate that it
 's one in a thousand that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the earth
 just in our own galaxy
 now i 've given you a lot of numbers here but they 're mostly big numbers  okay  so  you know  keep that in mind there 's plenty of real estate plenty of real estate in the universe 
  and if we 're the only bit of real estate in which there 's some interesting occupants that makes you a miracle  
 right so the bottom line is this because of the increase in speed  and because of the vast amount of
 habitable real estate in the cosmos 
 i figure we 're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years and i feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you either we 're going to find e t in the next two dozen years or i 'll buy you a cup of coffee
  so that 's not so bad i mean even with two dozen years you open up your browser and there 's news of a signal or you get a cup of coffee  now  
 let me tell you about some aspect of this that
 people don 't think about and that is what happens suppose that
 what i say is true  i mean who knows but suppose it happens suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company  
 what is the effect what 's the consequence 
 now i might be at ground zero for this i happen to know what the consequence for me would be because we 've had false alarms 
 this is one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and this is a photo i made at about three o 'clock in the morning in mountain view here when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought this is the real deal all
 right and i kept waiting for the men in black to show up right i kept waiting for
 i kept waiting for my mom to call somebody to call the government to call nobody called  nobody called
 i was so nervous
 that i couldn 't sit down i just wandered wandered around taking photos like this one just for something to do well at nine thirty in the morning with my head down on my desk because i obviously hadn 't slept all night 
 the phone rings and it 's the new york times  and i think there 's a lesson in that and that lesson is that if we pick up a signal the media  the media will be on it faster than a weasel on ball bearings it 's going to be fast you can be sure of that no secrecy
  that 's what happens to me it kind of ruins my whole whole week because whatever i 've got planned that week is kind of out the window  but what about you what 's it going to do to you 
 and the answer is that we don 't know the answer we don 't know what that 's going to do to you not in the long term  and not even very much in the short term i mean that would be a bit like
 asking chris columbus in one thousand four hundred and ninety one hey chris you know what happens if it turns out that there 's a continent between here and japan
  you 're sailing to what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case and
 i think chris would probably offer you some some answer that you might not have understood
  but it probably wouldn 't have been right and i think that to predict what finding e t ' s going to mean  we can 't predict that either but here are a couple things i can say to begin with  it 's going to be a
 society that 's way in advance of our own you 're not going to hear from alien neanderthals they 're not building transmitters they 're going to be ahead of us maybe by a few thousand years maybe by a few millions years but substantially ahead of us  and that means if you can understand anything that they 're going to say 
 then you might be able to  short circuit history by getting information from a society that 's way beyond our own now you might find that a bit hyperbolic and maybe it is  
 but nonetheless  it 's conceivable
  you could consider this like  i don 't know giving julius caesar english lessons and the key to the library of congress it would change his day all right 
 that 's one thing another thing that 's for sure going to happen
 is that it will calibrate us we will know that we 're not that miracle  
 right  that we 're just another duck in a row we 're not the only kids on the block and i think that that 's philosophically a very profound thing to learn 
 we 're not a miracle  okay  
 the third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague but i think interesting and important  and that is if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society because they will be 
 that will tell you something about our own possibilities that we 're not inevitably doomed
  because they survived their technology we could do it too normally when you look out into the universe
  you 're looking back in time all
 right that 's interesting to cosmologists but in this sense you actually can look into the future  hazily but you can look into the future so those are all the sorts of things that would
 come from a detection  now  let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime  and that is  
 seti i think is important because it 's exploration and it 's not only exploration it 's comprehensible exploration
  gotta tell you i 'm
 always reading books about explorers i find exploration very interesting
  arctic exploration you know  people like magellan  amundsen shackleton 
 you see franklin down there scott all these guys it 's really nifty 
 exploration and they 're just doing it because they want to explore  and you might say oh that 's kind of a frivolous opportunity but that 's not frivolous that 's not a frivolous activity 
 because i mean think of ants  you know most ants are
  programmed to follow one another along in a long line but there are a couple of ants maybe one percent of those ants that are what they call pioneer ants  and they 're the ones that wander off they 're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop you
 gotta get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something  but those ants even though most of them get wiped out those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the
  so exploration is important  
 i also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what i think is a critical
 lack
 in our society and that is the lack of science literacy the lack of the ability to even understand science now look a lot has been written about the
 deplorable state of science literacy in this country you 've heard about
  here 's one example in fact  polls taken this poll was taken ten years ago it shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there we 're looking for them out there  but they 're here right  sailing 
  the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn 't approve of well
  homeopathy or that
 evolution is just you know sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs or you know evolution all that sort of thing or global warming these sorts of ideas don 't really have any validity that you can 't trust the scientists 
 now we 've got to solve that problem because that 's a critically important problem
  suggest to you that seti obviously can 't solve the problem but it can address the problem 
 it can address the problem by getting young people interested in science look science is hard it has a reputation of being hard  and the facts are it is hard  
 and that 's the result of four hundred years of science 
 right  i mean in the 18th century in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library
  if you could find the library right  in the  19th century if you had a basement lab 
 you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home right because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up now
 that 's not true anymore today  you 've got to spend years in grad school and post doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are it 's hard there 's no doubt about it
 and in fact here 's an example the higgs boson finding the higgs boson 
 ask the next ten people you see on the streets hey do you think it 's worthwhile to spend billions of swiss francs looking for the higgs boson and
 i bet the answer you 're going to get is well i don 't know what the higgs boson is and i don 't know if it 's important and probably most of the people wouldn 't even know the value of a swiss franc  
  and yet we 're spending billions of swiss francs on this problem  okay so that doesn 't get people interested in science because they can 't comprehend what it 's about 
 seti on the other hand is really simple we 're going to use these big antennas and we 're going to try to eavesdrop on signals everybody can understand that yes technologically it 's very sophisticated but everybody gets the idea  
 so that 's one thing the other thing is it 's exciting science  
 it 's exciting because we 're naturally interested in other intelligent beings and i think that 's part of our hardwiring i mean we 're hardwired to be interested in
  might be if you will competitors or if you 're the romantic sort possibly even mates  okay i mean this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth  
 right we 're interested in things that have big teeth and you can see the evolutionary value of that and you can also see the practical consequences by watching watching animal planet  you notice they make very few programs 
  about gerbils it 's mostly about things that have big teeth  okay  so we 're interested in these sorts of things
  not just us  it 's also kids this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science because seti involves all kinds of science obviously biology obviously astronomy but also geology also chemistry 
 various scientific disciplines all can be
 presented in the guise of we 're looking for e t 
  this is interesting and important  and in fact it 's my policy even though i give a lot of talks to adults you give talks to adults and two days later they 're back where they were 
 but if you give talks to kids you know 
 one in fifty of them some light bulb goes off  and they think gee i 'd never thought of that and then they go  you know read a book or a magazine or whatever they get interested in something 
 now it 's my
  supported only by anecdotal personal anecdotal evidence but nonetheless  that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and eleven you 've
 got to get them there so all right i give talks to adults that 's fine but i try and make ten percent of the talks that i give i try and make those for kids   
 i remember when a guy came to our high school actually it was actually my junior high school i was in sixth grade 
 and he gave some talk all i remember from it was one word electronics it was like dustin hoffman in the graduate
  he said plastics whatever that means plastics all right so the guy said electronics i don 't remember anything else in fact i don 't remember anything that my sixth grade teacher said all year  but i remember electronics 
 and so i got interested in electronics and you know i studied to get my ham license i was wiring up stuff here i am at about fifteen or something doing that sort of stuff okay that had a big effect on me 
 so that 's my point that you can have a big effect on these kids
  fact  this reminds me i don 't know a
 couple years ago i gave a talk at a school in palo alto
 where there were about a dozen 11 year olds that had come to this talk i had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour 
 eleven year olds they 're all sitting in a little semi circle looking up at me with big eyes  and i started there was a white board behind me and i started off by writing a one with twenty two zeroes
  the number of stars in the visible universe and this number is so big there 's not even a name for
 it and one of these kids shot up his hand  and he said well actually there is a name for it it 's a 
 right now that kid was wrong by four orders four orders of magnitude  
 but there was no doubt about it these kids were smart okay  so i stopped giving the lecture all they wanted to do was ask questions
  these kids at the end i said you know  you kids are smarter than the people i work with now laughter
 they didn 't even care about that what they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions 
 let me just say look my job is a privilege because we 're in a special time  previous generations couldn 't do this experiment at all
  generation down the line i think we will have succeeded  so to me  it is a privilege  and when i look in the mirror the facts are that i really don 't see myself what i see is the generation behind 
  me these are some kids from the huff school fourth graders i talked there what two weeks ago something like that
