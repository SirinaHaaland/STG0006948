  you 're walking through a forest  
 i 'm guessing you 're thinking of a collection of trees what we foresters call a stand with their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns  
  trees are the foundation of forests  but a forest is much more than what you see  and today i want to change the way you think about forests  
 you see  underground there is this other world 
 a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate
 and allow the forest to behave as though it 's a single organism it might remind you of a sort of intelligence how do i know this
 here 's my story  i grew up in the forests of british columbia  
 i used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns  they were giants 
 my grandfather was a giant too he was a horse logger  and he used to selectively cut cedar poles from the inland rainforest  
 grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods  and how my family was knit into it
 so i followed in grandpa 's footsteps  he and i had this curiosity about forests  
 and my first big aha moment was at the outhouse by our lake our poor dog jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit
  so grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog  he was down
  swimming in the muck
 but as grandpa dug through that forest floor i became fascinated with the roots and under that what i learned later was the white mycelium and under that the red and yellow mineral horizons 
 eventually grandpa and i rescued the poor dog  
 but it was at that moment that i realized that that palette of roots and soil was really the foundation of the
  and i wanted to know more  so i studied forestry  
 but soon i found myself working alongside the powerful people in charge of the commercial harvest  
 the extent of the clear cutting was alarming  and i soon found myself conflicted by my part in it 
 not only that 
 the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches to make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs
  was astounding  it seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine  so i went back to school  
 and i studied my other world  
 you see scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vitro that one pine seedling root could transmit carbon to another pine seedling root  
 but this was in the laboratory
  and i wondered  could this happen in real forests  i thought yes trees in real forests might also share information below ground  
 but this was really controversial and some people thought i was crazy  
 and i had a really hard time getting research funding  but i persevered  
 and i eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest
  ago  
 i grew eighty replicates of three species paper birch douglas fir and western red cedar  
 i figured the birch and the fir would be connected in a belowground web  
 but not the cedar it was in its own other world  
 and i gathered my apparatus  and i had no money so i had to do it on the cheap
  so i went to canadian tire laughter
 and i bought some plastic bags and duct tape and shade cloth a timer a paper suit a respirator  
 and then i borrowed some high tech stuff from my university a geiger counter a scintillation counter a mass spectrometer microscopes  
 and then i got some really dangerous stuff  syringes full of radioactive carbon 14 carbon dioxide gas and some high pressure bottles of the stable isotope carbon 13 carbon
 carbon 13 carbon dioxide gas  but i was legally permitted 
 oh and i forgot some stuff  important stuff the bug spray  
 the bear spray  the filters for my respirator  oh well
  the first day of the experiment we got out to our plot and a grizzly bear and her cub chased us off  and i had no bear spray
 but you know this is how forest research in canada goes 
 so i came back the next day and mama grizzly and her cub were gone  so this time we really got started  and i pulled on my white paper suit  i put on my respirator  
 and then
 i put the plastic bags over my trees i got my giant syringes
  and i injected the bags with my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases first the birch i injected 
 the radioactive gas into the bag of birch and then for fir i injected the stable isotope carbon 13 carbon dioxide gas  
 i used two isotopes  because i was wondering whether there was
  communication going on between these species 
 i got to the final bag 
 the 80th replicate and all of a sudden mama grizzly showed up again  and she started to chase me and i had my syringes above my head and i was swatting the mosquitos and i jumped into the truck and i thought 
 this is why people do lab studies 
 i waited an
  i figured it would take this long for the trees to suck up the co2 through photosynthesis turn it into sugars send it down into their roots 
 and maybe i hypothesized  shuttle that carbon belowground to their neighbors  
 after the hour was up i rolled down my window  and i checked for mama grizzly 
 oh good she 's over there eating her  huckleberries so i got out of the truck and i got to work  
 i went to my first bag with the birch i pulled the bag off
 i ran my geiger counter over its leaves kkhh 
 perfect the birch had taken up the radioactive gas 
 then the moment of truth  i went over to the fir tree 
 i pulled off its bag  i ran the geiger counter up its needles  and i heard the most beautiful sound kkhh 
 it was the sound of birch talking to
  and birch was saying hey can i help you 
 and fir was saying yeah can you send me some of your carbon because somebody threw a shade cloth over me 
 i went up to cedar  and i ran the geiger counter over its leaves  and as i suspected 
 silence cedar was in its own world it was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir
  fir 
 i was so excited
  i ran from plot to plot and i checked all eighty replicates the evidence was clear the c 13 and c 14 was showing me that paper birch and douglas fir were in a lively two way conversation 
 it turns out at that time of the year in the summer that birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch
  when the fir was shaded  
 and then in later experiments we found the opposite that fir was sending more carbon to birch than birch was sending to fir  and this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless 
 so it turns out the two species were interdependent like yin and yang 
 and at that moment everything came into
 focus for me  i knew i had found something big 
 something that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests  from not just competitors but to cooperators  
 and i had found solid evidence of this massive belowground communications network the other world 
 now i truly hoped and believed that my discovery would change how we
  to more holistic and sustainable methods methods that were less expensive and more practical  what was i thinking i
 'll come back to that  
 so how do we do science in complex systems like forests  
 well as forest scientists we have to do our research in the forests and that 's really tough as i 've shown
  we have to be really good at running from bears
  but mostly we have to persevere in spite of all the stuff stacked against us  
 and we have to follow our intuition and our experiences and ask really good questions  
 and then we 've got to gather our data and then go verify for me i 've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest 
 some of my oldest experimental plantations are now over thirty years old 
 you can check them out
 that 's how forest science works 
 so now i want to talk about the science how were paper birch and douglas fir communicating 
 well it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon
 but also nitrogen and phosphorus and water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones
 information and you know i have to tell you before me
  scientists had thought that this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza was involved
 mycorrhiza literally means fungus root 
 you see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest they 're the mushrooms  
 the mushrooms though are just the tip of the iceberg  because coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium and that mycelium infects
  and colonizes the roots of all the trees and plants and where the fungal cells interact with the root cells there 's a trade of carbon for nutrients 
 and that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil and coating every soil particle 
 the web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium under a single
  and not only that that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest 
 individuals not only of the same species but between species like birch and fir  and it works kind of like the internet  
 you see like all networks mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links  
 we made this map by examining the short sequences of dna of every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of douglas fir
  forest in this picture  the circles represent the douglas fir or the nodes and the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways or the links
  the biggest  darkest nodes
 are the busiest nodes  we call those hub trees  or more fondly mother trees 
 because it turns out that those hub trees nurture their young  
 the ones growing in the understory
  and if you can see those yellow dots those are the young seedlings that have established within the network of the old mother trees 
 in a single forest a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees 
 and using our isotope tracers  we have found that mother trees will send their excess carbon through the mycorrhizal network to the understory seedlings  
 and we 've associated this with increased seedling
  survival by four times 
 now we know we all favor our own children  and i wondered could douglas fir recognize its own kin 
 like mama grizzly and her cub  
 so we set about an experiment and we grew mother trees with kin and stranger 's seedlings  
 and it turns out they do recognize their kin mother trees colonize their kin
  with bigger mycorrhizal networks  they send them more carbon below ground they even reduce their own root competition to make elbow room for their kids  
 when mother trees are injured or dying 
 they also send messages of wisdom on to the next generation of seedlings  
 so we 've used isotope tracing to trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree down her trunk into the mycorrhizal
  network and into her neighboring seedlings 
 not only carbon but also defense signals and these two compounds have increased the resistance of those seedlings to future stresses  
 so trees talk
  increase the resilience of the whole community  
 it probably reminds you of our own social communities and our families  well at least some families 
 laughter so let 's come back to the initial point 
 forests aren 't simply collections of trees they 're complex systems with hubs and networks
 that overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate and they provide
  avenues for feedbacks and adaptation  and this makes the forest resilient that 's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks  
 but they 're also vulnerable vulnerable not only to natural disturbances
 like bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees but high grade logging
  you see you can take out one or two hub trees but there comes a tipping point  
 because hub trees are not unlike rivets in an airplane  you can take out one or two and the plane still flies  
 but you take out one too many or maybe that one holding on the wings  
 and the whole system collapses  
 so now how are you thinking about forests
  remember i said earlier that i hoped that my research my discoveries would change the way we practice forestry  
 well i want to take a check on that thirty years later here in western canada 
 this is about one hundred kilometers to the west of us just on the border of banff national park
 that 's a lot of clear cuts it 's not so pristine 
 in two thousand and fourteen the world resources institute reported that canada in the past decade has had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide  
 and i bet you thought it was brazil 
 in canada it 's three point six percent per year now by my estimation that 's about four times
  rate that is sustainable 
 now massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles degrade wildlife habitat  and emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere  which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks 
 not only that we 're continuing to plant one or two species and weed out the aspens and birches these simplified
  forests lack complexity and they 're really vulnerable to infections and bugs  
 and as climate changes this is creating a perfect storm
 for extreme events like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak that just swept across north america  or that 
  so i want to come back to my final question  
 instead of weakening our forests  how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change well
 you know the great thing about forests as complex systems is they have enormous capacity to self heal 
 in our recent experiments we found with  patch cutting and retention of hub trees and regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes
 that these mycorrhizal networks  they recover really rapidly 
 so with this in mind i want to leave you with four simple solutions  and we can 't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on 
 first we all need to get out in the forest  
 we need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests  you see most of our
  forests now are managed using a 
  approach  but good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions  
 second  we need to save our old growth forests  
 these are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks  
 so this means less cutting  i don 't mean no cutting but
  less cutting  
 and third  when we do cut  we need to save the legacies  
 the mother trees and networks  and the wood  the genes so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road  
 we need to be conservationists 
 and finally  fourthly and finally
  we need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species and genotypes and structures by planting and allowing natural regeneration 
 we have to give mother nature the tools she needs to use her intelligence to self heal 
 and we need to remember that forests aren 't just a bunch of trees competing with each other
 jigs 's fall into the outhouse showed me
 this other world  and it changed my view of forests  i hope today to have changed how you think about forests  thank you
