  at rice university  
 jfk told the country about a dream he had 
 a dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade  the eponymous moonshot 
 no one knew if it was possible to do
 but he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible 
 that 's how great dreams are great dreams aren 't just visions they 're visions coupled to strategies for making them real i
 have the incredible good fortune
 to work at a moonshot factory at x formerly called google x you 'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside
  a fashion designer and former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts 
 these inventors engineers and makers
 are dreaming up technologies that we hope can make the world a wonderful place  
 we use the word moonshots to remind us to keep our visions big to keep dreaming  and we use the word
  factory to remind ourselves that we want to have concrete visions concrete plans to make them real
 here 's our moonshot blueprint  number one  we want to find a huge problem in the world that affects many millions of people number two 
 we want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem 
 and then number three
  has to be some reason to believe
 that the technology for such a radical solution could actually be built  
 but i have a secret for you the moonshot factory is a messy place  
 but rather than avoid the mess  pretend it 's not there  we 've tried to make that our strength 
 we spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove that
  we 're wrong 
 that 's it that 's the secret  
 run at all the hardest parts of the problem first 
 get excited and cheer hey how are we going to kill our project today 
 we 've got this interesting balance going
 where we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions
  but then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism
 to breathe life  breathe reality into those visions 
 i want to show you a few of the projects that we 've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor and also a few of the gems that at least so far have not only survived that process but have been
  accelerated by it 
 last year we killed a project in automated vertical farming 
 this is some of the lettuce that we grew one in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment  so this is a moonshot that needs to happen  
 vertical farming uses ten times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming and because you can grow the food close to where it 's consumed 
 you don 't have to transport it large distances
 we made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting  
 but unfortunately we couldn 't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way  
 so we killed the project 
 here 's another huge problem  we pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage
 to ship goods worldwide
 economic development of landlocked countries is limited by lack of shipping infrastructure  the radical solution a 
 cargo ship this has the potential to lower at least overall the cost
  and carbon footprint of shipping without needing runways  
 we came up with this clever set of technical breakthroughs that together might make it possible for us to lower the cost enough that we could actually make these ships inexpensively enough in volume  
 but however cheap they would have been to make in volume
 it turned out that it was going to cost close to two hundred million dollars to design and build the first one
  two hundred million dollars is just way too expensive 
 because x is structured with these tight feedback loops of making mistakes and learning and new designs  we can 't spend two hundred million dollars to get the first data point about whether we 're on the right track or not 
 if there 's an achilles ' heel in one our projects we want to know it now up front
 so we killed this project too 
 discovering a major flaw in a project doesn 't always mean that it ends the project sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path 
 this is our fully 
 vehicle prototype  which we built without a steering wheel or break pedal  
 but that wasn 't actually our goal when we started with one point two million people
 dying
 on the roads globally every year  building a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take three and a half years ago  
 when we had these lexus  retrofitted self driving cars in testing they were doing so well we gave them out to other googlers to find out what they thought of the experience  
 and what we discovered was that our plan
  to have the cars do almost all the driving
 and just hand over to the users in case of emergency was a really bad plan 
 it wasn 't safe
 because the users didn 't do their job they didn 't stay alert in case the car needed
  to hand control back to them this was a major crisis for the team it sent them back to the drawing board  
 and they came up with a beautiful new perspective  aim for a car
 where you 're truly a passenger 
 you tell the car where you want to go you push a button and it takes you from point a to point b by itself we 're
  really grateful that we had this insight as early on in the project as we did and it 's shaped
 everything we 've done since then and now our cars have 
 more than one point four million miles  and they 're out everyday on the streets of mountain view california and austin texas 
 the cars team
 shifted their perspective this is one of x 's mantras  sometimes shifting your perspective
 is more powerful than being smart 
 take wind energy it 's one of my favorite examples of perspective shifting there 's no way
 that we 're going to build a better standard wind turbine than the experts in that industry  but
 we found a way to get up higher
  into the sky and so get access to faster more consistent winds and so more energy
 without needing hundreds of tons of steel to get there 
 our makani energy kite rises up from its perch by spinning up those propellers along its wing  and it pulls out a tether as it rises  
 pulling energy up through the tether  once the tether 's all the way out it goes into crosswind circles in the sky 
 and now those propellers
  that lifted it up have become flying turbines  and that sends energy back down the tether  
 we haven 't yet found a way to kill this project  and the longer it survives that pressure  the more excited we get that this could become
 a cheaper and more deployable form of wind energy for the world 
 probably the craziest sounding project
  we have is project loon we 're trying to make
 internet a network of balloons in the stratosphere
 that beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world 
 this could bring online as many as four billion more people who today have little or
  but you can 't just take
 a cell tower strap it to a balloon and stick it in the sky  the winds are too strong it would be blown away  and the balloons are too high up
 to tie it to the ground  here comes the crazy moment what if instead we let the balloons drift
 and we taught them how to sail the winds to go where the needed to go 
 it turns out the
 has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata  so we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world 
 we could maneuver the balloons a bit getting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere to grab those winds going in those different directions
  the idea is to have enough balloons so as one balloon floats out of your area there 's another balloon ready to float into place  handing off the internet connection 
 just like your phone hands off between cell towers as you drive down the freeway 
 we get
 how crazy that vision sounds there 's the name of the project to remind
  so since two thousand and twelve the loon team has prioritized
 the work that seems the most difficult and so the most likely
 to kill their project 
 the first thing that they did was try to get a wi fi connection from a balloon in the stratosphere down to an antenna on the ground  
 it worked  and i promise you there were bets that it wasn 't going to so we kept going 
 could we get the
  to talk directly to handsets  so that we didn 't need the antenna as an intermediary receiver  yeah  
 could we get the balloon bandwidth high enough so it was a real internet connection  so that
 people could have
 something more than just sms  the early tests weren 't even a megabit per second  but now we can do up to
  megabits per second  enough to watch a ted talk 
 could we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky so that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas  
 check 
 could we get balloons the size of a house to stay up for more than one
  while costing less than five percent of what traditional long life balloons have cost to make 
 yes in the end  but
 i promise you you name it we had to try it to get there  we made round silvery balloons  
 we made giant pillow shaped balloons  
 we made balloons the size of a blue whale we
  busted a lot of balloons 
 since one of the things that was most likely to kill the loon project was whether we could guide the balloons through the sky 
 one of our most important experiments was putting
 a balloon inside a balloon  so there are two compartments here one with air and then one
 with helium 
 the balloon pumps air in to make itself heavier or lets air out to make it lighter  
 and these weight changes allow it to rise or fall 
 and that simple movement of the balloon is its steering mechanism  
 it floats up or down hoping to grab winds going in the speed and direction that it wants  
 but is that good enough for it to navigate through the world  barely at first
 but better all the time this particular balloon our latest balloon can navigate a 
  two mile vertical stretch of sky
 and can sail itself to within five hundred meters of where it wants to go from twenty thousand kilometers away  
 we have lots more to do in terms of
 fine tuning the system and reducing costs  
 but last year a balloon built inexpensively went around the world nineteen times over one hundred and eighty seven days  so we 're going to 
  keep going 
 our balloons today are doing pretty much everything a complete
  system needs to do 
 we 're in discussions with telcos around the world  and we 're going to fly over places like indonesia for real service testing this year  
 this probably all sounds too good to be true  
 and you 're right 
 being audacious and working on big risky things makes people inherently uncomfortable you cannot
 yell at people and force them to fail fast 
 people resist  they worry what will happen to me if i fail  will people laugh at me 
 will i be fired 
 i started with
 our secret i 'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen the only way to get people to
  work on big  risky things audacious ideas and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first is if you make that the path of least resistance for them 
 we work hard at x to make it safe to fail 
 teams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table because they 're rewarded
  for it they get applause from their peers  hugs and high fives from their manager me in particular 
 they get promoted for it we have bonused every single person
 on teams that ended their projects from teams as small as two to teams of more than thirty  we believe in dreams at the moonshot factory
  enthusiastic skepticism is not the enemy of boundless optimism it 's optimism 's perfect partner  
 it unlocks the potential
 in every idea we can create the future that 's in our dreams thank you very much
