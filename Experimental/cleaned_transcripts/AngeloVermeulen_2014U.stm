  i am multidisciplinary as a scientist  i 've been a crew commander for a nasa mars simulation last year  
 and as an artist  i create multicultural
 community art all over the planet  and recently i 've actually been combining both  but let me first
  first talk a little more about that nasa mission  
 this is the  hi seas program hi seas is a  nasa funded planetary surface analogue on the mauna loa volcano in hawaii  
 and it 's a research program that is specifically designed to study the effects of long term isolation of small crews  
 i lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six a very interesting experience
 of course  we did all kinds of research 
 our main research was actually a food study but apart from that food study developing a new food system for astronauts living in deep space we also did all kinds of other research  we did  extra vehicular activities as you can see here  
 wearing mock up space suits  but we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do like questionnaires at the end of every day
  busy work 
 now  as you can imagine it 's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people in a small space for a long time 
 there 's all kinds of psychological challenges how to keep a team together in these circumstances 
 how to deal with the warping of time you start to sense when you 're living in these circumstances  sleep
  but also we learned a lot  
 i learned a lot about how individual crew members actually cope with a situation like this how you can keep a crew productive and happy 
 for example  giving them a good deal of autonomy is a good trick to do that and honestly  i learned a lot about leadership  because i was a crew commander  
 so
 doing this mission i really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space we will venture into
  outer space and we will start inhabiting outer space i have no doubt about it it might take fifty years or it might take five hundred years  but
 it 's going to happen nevertheless  so i came up with a new art project called seeker  
 and the seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world to come up with starship
  human habitation and survival that 's the core of the project  now  
 one important thing this is not a dystopian project this is not about oh my god the world is going wrong and we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else no no 
 the project is basically inviting people to take a step away from earthbound constraints and
  's really helpful and it works really well  so that 's that 's really the important part
 of what we 're doing  
 now  in this project  i 'm using a cocreation approach  which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many
 many artists i 'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group into a community people start gravitating to the idea
  little bit like termites really we just work together and even for example when architects visit what we 're doing  sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding how we build without a master plan we always come up with these fantastic 
 that actually we can also inhabit the first version was done in
 in belgium and holland it was built with a team of almost fifty people this is the second iteration of that
  same project  but in slovenia in a different country and the new group was like we 're going to do the architecture differently  so they took away the architecture they kept the base of the artwork  
  and they built an entirely new much more biomorphic architecture on top of that and that 's another crucial part of the project  it 's an evolving artwork  evolving architecture 
  which was using caravans as modules to build a starship  we bought some second hand caravans  cut them open  and reassembled them into a starship  
 now  
 when we 're thinking about starships we 're not just approaching it as a technological challenge we 're really looking at it as a combination of three systems  ecology
  and technology so there 's always a strong ecological component in the project here you can see
 aquaponic systems that are actually surrounding the astronauts so they 're constantly in in contact with part of the food that they 're eating  
 now a very typical thing for this project project is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects
  we actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end  and test what we build and this is for example on the right hand side you can see an isolation mission in the museum of modern art in ljubljana in slovenia  
 where six artists and designers locked themselves up i was part of that for four days inside the museum and 
 of course obviously this is a very performative and very strong experience for all of us
  the next version of the project is currently
 being developed together with camilo  rodriguez beltran who is also a ted fellow in the atacama desert in chile 
 a magical place 
 first of all it 's really considered a mars analogue it really does look like mars in certain locations and has been used by nasa to test equipment  
 and it has a long history
  of being connected to space through observations of the stars it 's now home to alma the large telescope that 's that 's being developed there 
 but also it 's the driest location on the planet  
 and that makes it extremely interesting to build our project  because suddenly sustainability is something we have to explore fully 
 we have no other option so i 'm very curious to see what 's going to happen
  a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that i 'm very interested to see how we can connect with the local population the
 native population  these people have been living there for a very long time and can be considered experts in sustainability 
 and so i 'm very interested to see what we can learn from them and have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration  
 so we 're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space by exploring
  integration biology technology and people by using a cocreation approach  
 and by using and exploring local traditions and to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future thank you
