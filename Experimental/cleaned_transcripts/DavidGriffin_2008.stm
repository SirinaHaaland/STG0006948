  start by looking at some great photographs 
 this is an icon of national geographic  an afghan refugee taken by steve mccurry  but the harvard lampoon
  lampoon is about to come out with a parody of national geographic and i shudder to think
 what they 're going to do to this photograph  oh  the wrath of photoshop  
 this is a jet landing at san francisco by bruce dale  he mounted a camera on the tail a
 poetic image for a story on tolstoy by sam abell 
 pygmies in the drc  by randy olson i love this
  photograph because it reminds me of degas ' bronze sculptures of the little dancer 
 a polar bear swimming in the arctic by
 paul nicklen polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth they 're not very good swimmers and we know what 's happening to the ice  
 these are camels moving across the rift valley in
  africa  photographed by chris johns shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels  
 this is a rancher in texas by william albert allard a great portraitist  
 and jane goodall  making her own special connection photographed
  this is a soap disco in spain photographed by david alan harvey and david said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor but 
 these are sea lions
 in australia doing their own dance by david doubilet  
 and this is a comet captured by dr euan mason
 and finally  the bow of the titanic without movie stars
  photographed by emory kristof 
 photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today 's saturated media world 
 because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment here 's an example
  four years ago  i was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches
 but i turned away for a moment  and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty i can stand here right now and
 see as i go tearing into the water after
  the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement 
 i can see the rocks are over here there 's a wave about to crash onto him  i can see his hands
 reaching out and i can see his face in terror looking at me  saying help me dad 
 i got him  the wave broke over broke over us we got back on shore he was fine we were a little bit rattled  
 but this flashbulb memory as it 's called is when all
  elements came together to define not just the event  but my emotional connection to it 
 and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection
 to a viewer  now i have to tell you i was talking to kyle last week
 about this that i was going to tell this story and he said oh yeah  i remember that too  i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me
  i thought i was a hero 
 laughter so this represents this is a cross sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world 's greatest photojournalists working at the very top of their
 craft except one 
 this photograph was taken by dr euan mason in new zealand last year  and it was submitted and published in national geographic
  year we added a section to our website called your shot where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community  
 the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing  and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them 
 but to be a
  great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you you 've got to be able to make them all the time  
 but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story 
 so i 'm going to share with you some coverages that i feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography 
 photographer nick
  nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in chad called zakouma  
 the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what nick did up to a point  
 this is a serval cat he 's actually taking his own picture shot with what 's called a camera trap there 's an infrared beam that 's going across and he has stepped into the beam and taken his
  photograph  
 these are baboons at a watering hole 
 nick the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons 
 a lion having a late night snack notice he 's got a broken tooth  
 and a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward
  its den i love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail  
 but the centerpiece species of zakouma are the elephants it 's one of the largest intact herds in this part of africa  here 's a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for 
 it was with the elephants that this story
  along with researcher
 dr michael fay collared the matriarch of the herd they named her annie 
 and they began tracking her movements  the herd was safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of park rangers  
 but once the annual rains began the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park  and that 's when they ran into trouble 
 for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks
 the matriarch that they were radio tracking after weeks of moving back and forth in and out of the park came to a halt outside the park  
 annie had been killed  along with twenty members of her herd  
 and they only came for the ivory 
  this is actually one of the rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory
 because they couldn 't leave it there because it 's still valuable but what nick did
 was he brought back
 a story that went beyond the old school method of just straight isn 't this an amazing world and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply  instead of just knowledge of this park
  he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflicts 
 now let 's go over to india  sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way 
 we were looking at the same issue that richard wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history more people live
 in urban rather than rural environments and most of that growth is not in the cities  but in the slums that surround them
  jonas bendiksen a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here 's my proposal  let 's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and
 i said well you know that might be a bit ambitious for our budget so instead what we did was we decided to instead of going out and doing what would result in what we 'd consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything
 jonas into dharavi  which is part of mumbai india and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this
 really
 major part of the city what jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places 
 he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned  
 by staying tightly
  focused in one place jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community
  and he did it in a beautiful way  
 sometimes though the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture 
 we teamed up underwater photographer brian skerry and photojournalist randy olson
 to document the depletion of the world 's fisheries
  weren 't the only ones to tackle this subject  
 but the photographs that brian and randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by brian 
 a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of baja  
 i 've seen sort of ok pictures of bycatch the
  animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species but here brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw
 the waste overboard 
 and brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom 
 back on land randy olson photographed a makeshift fish market in africa  where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the
  locals  the main parts having already been sent to europe  
 and here in china randy shot a jellyfish market 
 as prime food sources are depleted  the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein this is called fishing down the food chain  
 but there are also glimmers of hope  and i think anytime we 're doing a
  we don 't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions
 brian photographed a marine sanctuary in new zealand where commercial fishing had been banned
 the result being that the overfished species have been restored and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries  
 photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial  
  at last year 's ted 
 took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the american wounded coming out of iraq 
 it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other  
 jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician
 tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here is in the field hospital
 the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed
  across his chest as a reminder of home  
 from here  the more severely wounded are transported back to germany where they meet up with their families for the first time
 and then back to the states to recuperate
 at veterans ' hospitals such as here in walter reed  and finally  often fitted with high tech prosthesis they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their
  jim took what could have been a straight up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply  
 now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics  
 but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to
  just plain fun  
 photographer paul nicklin traveled to antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals 
 they have been rarely photographed partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean 
 in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you can imagine paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water
 now what leopard seals do mostly
 is they eat penguins  you know of the march of the penguins this is sort of the munch of the penguins
 here a penguin
 goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out  
 but then paul got in the water 
 and he said he was never really afraid of this  well this one female came up to him  she 's probably it 's a shame you can 't see it in the photograph but she 's twelve feet long
  pretty significant in size  
 and paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how big i am or you know my what big teeth you have 
 then paul thinks that she simply took pity on him to her here was this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn 't seem to be interested in chasing penguins
 so what she did was she started to bring penguins to him  alive  
 and put them in front of him  
 she dropped them off  and then they would swim away she 'd kind of look at him like what are you doing go back and get them  and then bring them back and drop them in front of him  and she did this over the course of a couple of days  
 until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head
 which just resulted in a fantastic photograph 
 eventually though paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive this is her
 just puffing out you know snorting out 
  lost interest with him and went back to what she does best
