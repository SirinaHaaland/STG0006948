  how do you feel about accidents when we think about accidents we usually consider them to be harmful unfortunate or even dangerous and they certainly can
 can be but are they always that bad
 the discovery that had led to penicillin for example is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time
 without biologist alexander fleming 's moldy accident caused by a neglected workstation we wouldn 't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections jeanny yao
 miranda and i are here today because we 'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries
  we visited the vancouver waste transfer station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste
 we realized that when plastics get to the dump it 's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities
 and when they 're mixed with organic matter and construction debris it 's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them mw
 however plastics are useful because they 're durable flexible and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes
 the downside of this
  convenience is that there 's a high cost to this
 plastics cause serious problems such as the destruction of ecosystems the pollution of natural resources and the reduction of available land space
 this picture you see here is the great pacific gyre when
 you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment we think about the great pacific gyre which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste
 but that 's no longer an accurate
  depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment
 right now the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris and there 's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn 't be able to find plastic particles jy
 in a plastic dependent society cutting down production is a good goal but it 's not enough and what about the waste that 's already been produced
 plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade
 so we thought you know what instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up let 's find a way to break them down
 with bacteria sounds cool right audience yeah jy thank you but
 we had a problem you see plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade
  we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go mw with this idea in mind jeanny and i read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the internet
 and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade twelve year
 we aimed to find bacteria from our local fraser river that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates
 phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility durability and transparency although they 're part of the plastic they 're not
  bonded to the plastic backbone as a result they easily escape into our environment not only do phthalates pollute our environment but they also pollute our bodies
 to make the matter worse phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure such as babies toys
 beverage containers cosmetics and even food wraps phthalates are horrible because they 're so easily taken into our bodies they
  can be absorbed by skin contact ingested and inhaled jy
 every year at least four hundred and seventy million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air water and soil the environmental protection agency even classified 
  this group as a top priority pollutant because it 's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor
  concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety
 so we figured if there are places along our fraser river that are contaminated with phthalates and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas then perhaps
 perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates mw
 so we presented this good idea to dr lindsay eltis at the university of british columbia and
 surprisingly he actually
 took us into his lab and asked his graduate students adam and james to help us
 little did we know at that time that
 a trip to the dump and some research on the internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life changing journey of accidents and discoveries jy
 the first step in our project
  was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the fraser river
 out of thousands of bacteria we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates
 so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source this implied that if anything grew in our cultures then they must be able to live off of phthalates
 everything went well from there and we became amazing scientists laughter mw um uh jeanny
 jy i 'm just joking mw okay well it was partially my fault
 you see i
  cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture and as a result we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice and this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation
 but this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous we noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite
 contamination levels so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels jy
 now that we grew the bacteria we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates because we thought that would be
 less accident prone but we were wrong again
 we poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi as a result we had to streak and
  restreak several times
 then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth and found that they shared an inverse correlation so as bacterial populations increased phthalate concentrations decreased
 this means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates mw
 so now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates we wondered what these bacteria were so jeanny and i took three of our most efficient
  strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database
 we were happy to see that although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation so this was actually a novel discovery jy
 to better understand how this biodegradation works we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways
  of our three strains to do this we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid mw
 we monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph
 this graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates
 our bacteria can transform phthalates which is a harmful toxin into end products such as carbon dioxide water and alcohol
 i know some of you in the crowd are thinking well carbon dioxide is horrible it 's a greenhouse gas
 but if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates they would have used some other kind of carbon source and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway
 we were also interested to see that although we 've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site we obtained the
  most efficient degraders from the landfill site so this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection jy
 so miranda and i shared this research at the sanofi biogeneius challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential
 although we 're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local
  problem
 we have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries
 throughout this journey we have also discovered our passion for science and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university
 we hope that in the near future we 'll be able to create
  model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants we can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and
 other natural resources
 and perhaps one day we 'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste mw
 i think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms and jeanny and i have shown
  that even mistakes can lead to discoveries einstein once said you can 't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them
 if we 're making plastic synthetically then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically thank you
