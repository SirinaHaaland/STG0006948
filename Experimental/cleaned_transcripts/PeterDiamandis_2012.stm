  in the wake of bin laden 's death have spiked
  so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months
 could have easily been the last six days or the last six years  the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that
  what our minds pay attention to  
 and there 's a very good reason for that every second of every day our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains 
 and because nothing is more important to us than survival the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala 
 now the amygdala is our early warning detector
  our danger detector  it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us 
 so given a dozen news stories we will preferentially look at the negative news 
 and that old newspaper saying if it bleeds it leads is very true 
 so given all of our digital devices
 that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week twenty four hours a day  it 's no wonder that we 're pessimistic
  's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse  
 but perhaps that 's not the case  perhaps instead  
 it 's the distortions brought to us of what 's really going on 
 perhaps the tremendous progress we 've made over the last century by a series of forces are in fact accelerating
 to a point that we have
  potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance now i 'm not saying we don 't have our set of problems
 climate crisis  species extinction water and energy shortage we surely do and as humans we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance  
 but ultimately
  we knock them down 
 so let 's look at what this last century has been
 to see where we 're going 
 over the last hundred years  the average human lifespan has more than doubled 
 average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled  childhood mortality has come down a factor of ten  
 add to that the
  steve pinker has showed us that in fact we 're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history  
 and charles kenny that global literacy has gone from twenty five percent to over eighty percent in the last one hundred and thirty years  
 we truly are living in an extraordinary time 
 and many people forget this  and we keep setting our expectations higher and
  higher  in fact we redefine what poverty means think of this in america today  the majority of people under the poverty line
 still have electricity water toilets refrigerators television mobile phones  air conditioning and cars  
 the wealthiest robber barons of the last century the emperors on this planet could have never dreamed of such luxuries
  underpinning much of this
 is technology and of late  exponentially growing technologies 
 my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve on moore 's law  
 and experiences price performance doubling
  that 's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the ' 70s now look at this curve 
 this is moore 's law over the last hundred years i want you to notice two things from this curve  number one how smooth it is
 through good time and bad time war time and peace time recession depression and boom time 
 this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers
  it doesn 't slow for any of our grand challenges  
 and also even though it 's plotted on a on a log curve on the left  it 's curving upwards  
 the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster 
 and on this curve riding on moore 's law are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies
 available to all of us cloud computing what my friends at autodesk
  call infinite computing sensors and networks robotics 3d printing which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet  
 synthetic biology  fuels vaccines and foods  digital medicine nanomaterials and a i i
 mean how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm 's watson i mean that was epic
  in fact i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could and i love this watson vanquishes human opponents 
 jeopardy 's not an easy game  it 's about the nuance of human language  
 and imagine if you would a i ' s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone  
  four years ago here at ted ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university  
 and we teach our students all of these technologies and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity 's grand challenges  
 and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade  
 think about that the fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives
  of a billion people today  thirty years ago that would have sounded ludicrous today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that
  when i think about creating abundance  
 it 's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet  it 's about creating a life of possibility  
  taking that which was scarce and making it abundant you see  scarcity is contextual and technology is a 
 force let me give you an example  so this is a story of napoleon iii in the 
 he 's the dude on the left  he invited over to
 dinner the king of siam 
 all of napoleon 's troops were fed with silver utensils  
 napoleon himself with gold utensils but the king of siam  he was fed with aluminum utensils 
 you see aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet  
 worth more than gold and platinum  
 it 's the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made
  even though aluminum is eight point three percent of the earth by mass 
 it doesn 't come as a pure metal  it 's all bound by oxygen and silicates but then the technology of electrolysis came along
 and literally made aluminum so cheap
 that we use it with throw away mentality  so let 's project this analogy going forward we think
  about energy scarcity  
 ladies and gentlemen we are on a planet that is bathed with five thousand times more energy than we use in a year  
 sixteen terawatts of energy hits the earth 's surface every eighty eight minutes it
 's not about being scarce it 's about accessibility  and there 's good news here for the first time this
  electricity in india eight point eight rupees versus seventeen rupees the cost of solar dropped fifty percent last year last month mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade 
 in the sunny parts of the united states  solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to fifteen cents as a national average 
 and if we have abundant energy we also have abundant water
 now
 we talk about water wars do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft
 back towards the earth in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety after it just passed saturn  he took a famous photo what was it called 
 a pale blue dot because we live on a water planet  we live on a planet seventy percent covered by water
  yes ninety seven point five percent is saltwater two percent is ice and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet  
 but here too there is hope  and there is technology coming online not ten twenty years from now  right now 
 there 's nanotechnology coming on nanomaterials  and the conversation i had
  the great diy innovators i 'd like to share with you he gave me permission to do so
 his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator  it 's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source saltwater polluted water latrine
 at less than two cents a liter  
 the chairman
  has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world and if that pans out which i have every confidence it will
 coca cola will deploy this globally to two hundred and six countries around the planet 
 this is the kind of innovation empowered by this technology that exists today  
 and we 've seen this in cellphones
  my goodness we 're going to hit seventy percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of two thousand and thirteen  think about it that a masai warrior on a cellphone 
  in the middle of kenya has better mobile comm than president reagan did twenty five years ago  
 and if they 're on a smartphone on google they 've got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did fifteen years ago they 're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted 
  that the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for
 gps  hd video and still images  libraries of books and music  medical diagnostic technology are now literally dematerializing 
  and demonetizing into your cellphone  
 probably the best part of it is what 's coming down the pike in health
  health 
 last month  i had the pleasure of announcing with qualcomm foundation something called the $ ten million qualcomm tricorder x prize  
 we 're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to because it 's got a i you can cough on it you can do a finger blood prick and to win it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of
 so literally imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors twenty five percent of the disease burden and one point three percent of the health care workers 
 when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn 't recognize  it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the
  but here here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance i call it the rising billion 
 so the white lines here are population  we just passed the seven billion mark on earth  and by the way the biggest protection against a population explosion 
 is making the world educated and healthy  
  online  connected 
 by two thousand and twenty that 's going from two billion to five billion internet users 
 three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation what
 will these people want what will they consume what will they desire
  and rather than having economic shutdown we 're about to have the biggest economic injection ever these people represent tens of trillions of dollars
 injected into the global economy  
 and they will get healthier by using the tricorder and they 'll become better educated by using the khan academy  and by literally being able to use
 3d printing and and infinite computing [ become ] more productive than ever before  
 so what could three billion rising
 healthy educated productive members of humanity bring to us 
 how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before 
 what about giving the oppressed  wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever what
 will these three billion people bring 
 what about contributions we can 't even predict  the one thing i 've learned
  at the x prize is that small teams
 driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past 
 let me share and close with a story that really got me excited 
 there is a program that some of you might have heard of it 's a game called foldit it came out of the university of washington in seattle
 and this is a game where individuals can actually
 take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold  
 and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality and it 's very important for research in medicine  and up until now it 's been a supercomputer problem  
 and this game has been played by university professors and so forth and
  people came online and started playing it and it showed that in fact today  the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers  
 and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world 
 it wasn 't an mit professor  it wasn 't a caltech student it was a person from england from manchester a woman
 who during the day
 was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and at night was the world 's best protein folder  
 ladies and gentlemen what gives me tremendous confidence in the future
 is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet  
 we have the tools with this
  exponential technology  we have the passion of the diy innovator we have the capital of the techno philanthropist and we have three billion new minds coming 
  online to work with us to solve the grand challenges to do that which we must do
