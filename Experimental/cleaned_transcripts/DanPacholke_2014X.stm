  the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy  
 i can 't define who comes to us or how long they stay  we get the people for whom nothing else has worked people who have fallen through all of the other social safety nets
  they can 't contain them so we must that 's our job contain them control them  
 over the years as a prison system as a nation  and as a society we 've become very good at that  but that shouldn 't make you happy  
 today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world  
 we have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in one thousand eight hundred and fifty 
 we house the parents of almost three million of our community 's children  and we 've become the new asylum the largest mental health provider
  in this nation  
 when we lock someone up that is no small thing 
 and yet we are called the department of corrections  
 today i want to talk about changing the way we think about corrections  i believe and my experience tells me that when we change the way we think we create new possibilities or futures  
 and prisons need a different future
  i 've spent my entire career in corrections over thirty years  i followed my dad into this field he was a vietnam veteran corrections suited him  
 he was strong steady disciplined
  i was not so much any of those things and i 'm sure that worried him about me  
 eventually i decided  if i was going to end up in prison i 'd better end up on the right side of the bars so i i thought i 'd check it out take a tour of the place my dad worked the mcneil island
  now this was the early ' 80s and prisons weren 't quite what you see on tv or in the movies in many ways it was worse  
 i walked into a cell house that was five tiers high there were eight men to a cell there were five hundred and fifty men in that living unit  and just in case you wondered  
 they shared one toilet in those small confines 
 an officer put a key in a lockbox and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells hundreds of men
 streamed out of their cells  i walked away as fast as i could 
 eventually i went back and i started as an officer there my job was to run one of those cell blocks and to control those hundreds of men 
 when i went to work at our receptions center  i could actually hear the inmates roiling from the parking lot shaking cell doors yelling  tearing up their cells  
 take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up and what you get is chaos contain and control that was our job 
 one way we learned to do this more effectively was a new type
  of housing unit called the intensive management unit imu a modern version of a hole 
 we put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors with cuff ports so we could restrain them and feed them  
 guess what 
 it got quieter  
 disturbances died down in the general population  places became safer because those inmates who were most violent or disruptive could now be isolated  
 but isolation isn 't good
  people of social contact and they deteriorate  it was hard getting them out of imu for them and for us even in prison  it 's no small thing
 to lock someone up 
 my next assignment was to one of the state 's deep end prisons where some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed  by then the industry had advanced a lot and we had different tools and techniques to manage disruptive behavior  
 we had beanbag guns and pepper
  spray and plexiglass shields  flash bangs emergency response teams we met violence with force and chaos with chaos  we were pretty good at putting out fires while i
 was there i met two experienced correctional
 workers who were also researchers an anthropologist and a sociologist  one day one of them commented to me and said you know you 're pretty good at putting out fires have
 you ever thought about how to prevent them
  i was patient with them  
 explaining our brute force approach to making prisons safer  they were patient with me out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments 
 first we started training our officers in teams rather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy  instead of four weeks of training we gave them ten 
 then we experimented with an apprenticeship model where we paired new staff with veteran staff
 they both got better at the work  
 second  we added verbal de escalation skills into the training continuum and made it part of the use of force continuum  
 it was the non force use of force 
 and then we did something even more radical we trained the inmates on those same skills we changed the skill set  reducing violence not
  just responding to it 
 third when we expanded our facility we tried a new type of design  
 now the biggest and most controversial component of this design of course was the toilet 
 there were no toilets  now that might not sound significant to you here today but at the time it was huge no one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet  we all thought it was dangerous and crazy even eight men to a cell had a toilet 
 that small detail changed the way we worked  inmates and staff started interacting more often and
  openly and developing a rapport  it was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated the unit was cleaner quieter safer and more humane 
 this was more effective at keeping the peace than any intimidation technique i 'd seen to that point  
 interacting changes the way you behave both for the officer and the inmate we changed the environment and we changed the behavior 
 now just in case i hadn 't learned this lesson they assigned me to headquarters next
 and that 's where i ran straight up against system change now many things work against system change  
 politics and politicians bills and laws  courts and lawsuits  internal politics 
 system change is difficult and slow  and oftentimes it doesn 't take you where you want to go  it 's no small thing
 to change a prison system so what i did do is i reflected on my earlier experiences and i remembered that when we interacted with offenders
  the heat went down when we changed the environment the behavior changed  and these were not huge system changes these were small changes and these changes created new possibilities  
 so next i got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison and at the same time i was working on my degree at the evergreen state college  
 i interacted with a lot of people who were not like me people who had different ideas and came from different
  one of them was a rainforest ecologist she looked at my small prison and what she saw was a laboratory  
 we talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they couldn 't complete on their own 
 like repopulating endangered species  frogs  butterflies endangered prairie plants 
 at the same time we found ways to make our operation more efficient through the addition of of solar power rainwater catchment  organic gardening
  this initiative has led to many projects that have had huge system wide impact not just in our system but in other state systems as well 
 small experiments making a big difference to science to the community 
 the way we think about our work changes our work 
 the project just made my job more interesting and exciting  i was excited  staff were excited officers were excited  inmates were excited  they were inspired
  wanted to be part of this they were making a contribution a difference one they thought was meaningful and important  
 let me be clear on what 's going on here though  inmates are highly adaptive  they have to be 
 oftentimes they know more about our own systems than the people who run them 
 and they 're here for a reason  i don 't see my job as to punish them or forgive them
  but i do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison 
 so that was the question could inmates live decent and meaningful lives  and if so what difference would that make 
 so i took that question back to the deep end 
 where some of our most violent offenders are housed  remember imus are for punishment you don 't get perks there like programming  
 that was how we thought 
 but then we started to
  that if any inmates needed programming it was these particular inmates in fact they needed intensive programming  
 so we changed our thinking one hundred and eighty degrees and we started looking for new possibilities  
 what we found was a new kind of chair  instead of using the chair for punishment we put it in classrooms okay we
 didn 't forget our responsibility to control but now inmates could interact safely face to face with other inmates and staff and because control was no longer an issue everybody could focus on other things 
 like learning behavior changed 
  changed our thinking and we changed what was possible and this gives me hope now
 i can 't tell you that any of this stuff will work what i can tell you though it is working our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates 
 and when our prisons are safe we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling  reducing recidivism may be our ultimate
  but it 's not our only goal 
 to be honest with you preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions 
 if we rely on just prisons to reduce crime i 'm afraid we 'll never get there  
 but prisons can do some things we never thought they could do 
 prisons can be the source of innovation and sustainability  repopulating endangered species and environmental restoration inmates can be scientists and beekeepers
  dog rescuers prisons can be the source of meaningful work and opportunity for staff
 and the inmates who live there  we can contain and control and provide humane environments these are not opposing qualities  
 we can 't wait ten to twenty years to find out if this is worth doing our strategy is not massive system change 
 our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months not years  we need more small pilots
  where we learn as we go  pilots that change the range of possibility  we need new and better ways to measure impacts on engagement on interaction on safe environments  
 we need more opportunities to participate in and contribute to our communities  your communities  
 prisons need to be secure  yes  safe  yes  we can do that prisons need to provide humane environments where people can participate
  contribute and learn meaningful lives we 're learning how to do that 
 that 's why i 'm hopeful  we don 't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison  we can define that  we can create that  
 and when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity prisons can be more than the bucket for failed social policy  maybe finally  we will earn our title 
 a department of corrections
