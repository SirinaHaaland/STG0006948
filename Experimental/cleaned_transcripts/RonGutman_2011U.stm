  i always wanted to be a superhero i wanted to save the world and make everyone happy  but i knew that i 'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true so i
 used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet krypton  which was a lot of fun but
  didn 't yield much result 
 when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers 
 i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth  
 i started my journey in california with a
 uc berkeley  30 year longitudinal study
 that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook  and tried to measure their success and
 well being throughout their life  
 by measuring the students ' smiles researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long lasting a subject 's marriage would be 
 how well she would score on standardized tests of well being and how inspiring she would be to others  
 in another yearbook i stumbled upon barry obama 's picture when i first saw his picture i thought that his superpowers came from his
 super collar but now i know it was all in his smile another aha moment came from a two thousand and ten wayne state university
 research project that looked into 
  baseball cards of major league players the researchers found that the span of a player 's smile could actually predict the span of his life 
 players who didn 't smile in their pictures
 lived an average of only seventy two point nine years  where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost eighty years 
 the good news is that we 're actually born smiling 
 using 3d ultrasound technology we can now see that developing babies appear to smile even in the
  when they 're born babies continue to smile initially mostly in their sleep and even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice 
 smiling is one of the most basic biologically uniform expressions of all humans in studies conducted in papua new guinea paul ekman the world 's most renowned researcher on facial expressions found that even members of the fore
  who were completely disconnected from western culture  and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals 
 attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and i would so from papua new guinea
 to hollywood
 all the way to modern art in beijing 
 we smile often  and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction how many people here in this room smile more than
  twenty times per day  raise your hand if you do  oh wow  
 outside of this room more than a third of us smile more than twenty times per day  whereas less than fourteen percent of us smile less than five 
  in fact  those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children  
 smile as many as four hundred times per day  
 have you ever wondered why being around children  who smile so frequently makes you smile very often 
 a recent study at uppsala university in sweden found that it 's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles you ask why 
  because smiling is evolutionarily contagious  and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles 
  it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real  so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler 
 in a recent mimicking study at the university of clermont ferrand in france  subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles  
 without the pencil subjects were excellent
  judges but with the pencil in their mouth when they could not mimic the smile they saw their judgment was impaired 
 in addition to theorizing on evolution in the origin of species charles darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory 
 his theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better rather than smiling being merely a result
  of feeling good 
 in his study darwin actually cited a french neurologist  guillaume duchenne  who sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles  please  don 't try this at home 
 in a related german study researchers used
 fmri imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting botox to suppress
 smiling muscles 
 the finding supported darwin 's theory  by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile 
 smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate a 
 pleasure inducer cannot match  british researchers found that
  one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to two thousand bars of chocolate 
 wait the same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to sixteen thousand pounds sterling in cash 
 that 's like twenty five grand a smile it 's not bad
 and think about it this way
 twenty five thousand times four hundred
 quite a few kids out there feel like mark zuckerberg every day 
 and unlike lots of chocolate  lots of smiling can actually make you healthier  smiling can help reduce the level of 
  hormones like cortisol  adrenaline and dopamine  increase the level
  and reduce overall blood pressure  and if that 's not enough smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others 
 a recent study at penn state university found that when you smile you don 't only appear to be more likable and courteous but you actually appear to be more competent  
 so whenever you want to look great and competent
  reduce your stress
 or improve your marriage or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost or
 as if you found twenty five grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn 't worn for ages 
 or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer
