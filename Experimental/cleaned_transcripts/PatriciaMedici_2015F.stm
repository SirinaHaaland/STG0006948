  this is
 one of the most amazing animals on the face of the earth  this is a tapir 
 now this this is a baby tapir the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom
  far there is no competition here 
 i have dedicated the past twenty years of my life to the research and conservation of tapirs in brazil  and it has been absolutely amazing  
 but at the moment  i 've been thinking really really hard about the impact of
  i 've been questioning myself about the real contributions i have made for the conservation of these animals i love so much am i being effective
 in safeguarding their survival 
 am i doing enough  
 i guess the big question here is am i studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation 
 or am i just documenting
  the world is facing so many different conservation crises  we all know that it 's all over the news every day tropical forests and other ecosystems are
 being destroyed  climate change so many species on the brink of extinction
  mammal of south america  they 're massive they 're powerful  adults can weigh up to three hundred kilos that 's half the size of a horse they 're gorgeous 
 tapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the amazon  
 and they absolutely need large patches of habitat in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and
  survive  but their habitat is being destroyed  
 and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution 
 and you see this is very very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found they 're herbivores fifty percent
  of their diet consists of fruit  
 and when they eat the fruit they swallow the seeds  which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces they play this major major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest 
 and for that reason tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest 
 isn 't that amazing if you think about it the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect
  biodiversity as a whole 
 i started my tapir work in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six still very young  fresh out of college  and it was a pioneer research and conservation program at that 
  point we had nearly zero information about tapirs mostly because they 're so difficult to study they 're nocturnal
  we got started getting very basic data about these animals but what is it that a conservationist does  
 well first we need data  we need field research we need those  long term datasets to support conservation action 
  and i told you tapirs are very hard to study so we have to
  on indirect methods to study them we have to capture and anesthetize them so that we can install gps collars around their necks and follow their movements 
 which is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world  and then we can gather information about how they use space how they move through the landscape what are their priority habitats and so much more
  we must disseminate what we learn we have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are 
 and it 's amazing how many people around the world
 do not know what a tapir is in fact many people think this is a tapir 
 let me tell you this is not a tapir this is a giant anteater tapirs do not eat ants
 and then next we have to provide training capacity building it is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future 
  we are losing several conservation battles  and we need more people doing what we do and they need the skills  and they need the passion
  to do that 
 ultimately we conservationists we must be able to apply our data to apply our accumulated knowledge to support actual conservation action 
 our first tapir program took place in the atlantic forest in the eastern part of brazil  one of the most threatened biomes in the world 
 the destruction of the atlantic forest began in the early 
  the portuguese first arrived in brazil
  beginning european colonization in the eastern part of south america  
 this forest was almost completely cleared for timber  agriculture cattle ranching and the construction of cities and today only 
  seven percent of the atlantic forest is still left standing and tapirs are found in very very small 
  in the atlantic forest we found out that tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forest
 to patch of forest 
 so our main approach in this region was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places for the establishment establishment of wildlife corridors in between those patches of forest 
 reconnecting
  the habitat so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely 
 after twelve years in the atlantic forest in two thousand and eight  we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the pantanal in the western part of brazil near the border with bolivia and paraguay  
  the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world an incredible place and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in south america  
 and working in the pantanal has been extremely refreshing
 because we found large healthy tapir populations in the area  and we have been able to study tapirs in the most natural conditions we 'll ever find very much free of threats 
 in the pantanal besides
 the gps collars we are using another technique camera traps this camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it 
  so thanks to these amazing devices  we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you 're trying to develop those conservation strategies
 and right now two thousand and fifteen we are expanding our work once again to the brazilian cerrado the open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of brazil  
 today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country 
 where natural habitat and wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats
  including once again cattle ranching large sugarcane and soybean plantations  poaching roadkill just to name a few  
 and somehow tapirs are still there 
 which gives me a lot of hope  but i have to say that starting this new program in the
 cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face when you drive around and you find dead
  tapirs along the highways
 and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations where they shouldn 't be 
 and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes because their families
 poach and eat them it really breaks your heart
  the situation in the cerrado made me realize it gave me the sense of urgency  
 i am swimming against the tide it made me realize that despite
 two decades of hard work trying to save these animals we still have so much work to do if we are to prevent them from disappearing  
 we have to find ways to solve all these problems  we really do  and you know what we really came to a point in the conservation world
 where we have
  to think out of the box we 'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now 
 and i told you roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the cerrado so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers on the gps collars we put on the tapirs these are the same stickers used on big trucks to avoid collision
 tapirs cross the highways after dark 
 so the stickers will hopefully
  help drivers see this shining thing crossing the highway  and maybe they will slow down a little bit 
 for now this is just a crazy idea  
 we don 't know we 'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill  
 but the point is maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done  
 and
 although i 'm struggling with all these questions in my
  mind right now  
 i have a pact with tapirs 
 i know in my heart that tapir conservation is my cause this is my passion 
 i am not alone  i have this huge network of supporters behind me 
 and there is no way i 'm ever going to stop i will continue doing this most probably for the rest of my life 
  doing this for patrcia my namesake one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the atlantic forest many many years ago 
 for rita and her baby vincent
 in the pantanal and i 'll keep doing this for ted a baby tapir we captured in december last year also
  in the pantanal  
 and i will keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that i 've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others i know i will encounter in the future 
 these animals deserve to be cared for 
 they need me they need us  
 and you know  we human beings deserve to live in a world where we can get out there and see and benefit from not only tapirs
  the other beautiful species now and in the future  thank you so much
