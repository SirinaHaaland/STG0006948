  i 'd like you to imagine the world anew 
 i 'd like to show you some maps which have been drawn by ben hennig 
 of the planet in a way that most of you will never have seen the planet
 depicted before
 here 's
 an image that you 're very familiar with 
 i 'm old enough that i was actually born before we saw this image apparently some of my first words were moona moona but i think that 's my mom
 having a particular fantasy about
 what her baby boy could see on the flickering black and white tv screen it 's only been a few centuries since we 've actually most of us
  of our planet as spherical when we first saw these images in the 
  world was changing at an incredible rate in my own little discipline
 of human geography a cartographer called waldo tobler was drawing new
  maps of the planet  and these maps have now spread and i 'm going to show you one of them now this map
 is a map of the world  but it 's a map which looks to you a little bit strange it 's a map
 in which we stretched places so that those areas which contain many people
 are drawn larger  and those areas like the sahara and the himalayas in which there are few people have been shrunk away 
 everybody on the planet is given an
  equal amount of space the cities are shown
 shining bright  
 the lines are showing you submarine cables and trade routes 
 and there 's one particular line that goes from the chinese port of dalian through past singapore through the suez canal 
 through the mediterranean and round to rotterdam and it 's showing you the route
 of what was the world 's largest ship just a year ago
  was taking so many containers of goods
 that when they were unloaded if the lorries had all gone in convoy they would have been one hundred kilometers long  
 this is how our world is now connected  this
 is the quantity of stuff we are now moving around the world  just on one ship on one voyage in five weeks
  weeks 
 we 've lived in cities for a very long time  
 but most of us didn 't live in cities  this is atalhyk one of the world 's first cities at its peak
 nine thousand years ago people had to walk over the roofs of others
  houses to get to their home  if you look carefully at the map of the city you 'll see it has no streets 
 because streets are something we invented the world changes it changes by trial and error  
 we work out slowly and gradually
 how to live in better ways  and the world has changed incredibly quickly most recently
 it 's only within the last six seven or eight generations
 that we have actually realized that we are a species it 's only within the last few decades
 that a map like this could be drawn 
 again  the underlying map is the map of world population but over it you 're seeing arrows
 showing how we spread out of africa
 with dates showing you where we think we arrived at particular times i have to redraw
 this map every few months  because somebody makes a discovery that a particular date
 was wrong  we are learning about ourselves
 at an incredible speed
  and we 're changing a lot of change is gradual it 's accretion we don 't notice
 the change because we only have short lives seventy eighty  if you 're lucky ninety years this graph is showing you
 the annual rate of population growth in the
  and then the rate of population growth began to rise
 so that around the time i was born when we first saw those images from the moon of our planet 
 our global population was growing at two percent a year  
 if it had carried on growing at two percent a year
 for just another couple of centuries
  centuries the entire planet would be covered with a seething mass of human bodies
 all touching each other 
 and people were scared 
 they were scared of population growth and what they called the population bomb in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight but then if you look at the end of the graph  
  the noughties and in this decade even faster
 our population growth is slowing our planet is stabilizing we are heading towards nine ten or eleven billion people by the end of the century
 within that change you can see
 tumult  you can see the second world war  you can
  and eighteen from influenza you can see the great chinese famine these are the events we tend to concentrate on we tend to concentrate on
 the terrible events in the news we don 't tend to concentrate on
 the gradual change and the good news stories  
 we worry about people  we worry about how many people there are  we worry about how you can get away
 from people but this is the map of the world changed again to make area
  large the further away
 people are from each area so if you want to know where to go to get away from everybody
  here 's the best places to go 
 and every year these areas get bigger because every year we are coming off the land globally we are moving into the
  we are packing in more densely there are wolves again in europe and the wolves are moving west
 across the continent our world is changing  
 you have worries  this is a map
 showing where the water falls on our planet we now know that and you can look at where
  where three continents meet africa asia and europe and you can see there are a large number of people living there in areas with very little water  and you can see areas in which there is a great deal of rainfall as well  and we can get a bit more sophisticated  
 instead of making the map
 be shaped by people we can shape the map by water  
 and then we can change it every month to show the amount of water falling on every small part of the globe  
 and you see the
  monsoons moving around the planet and the planet almost appears to have a heartbeat  and all of this
 only became possible
 within my lifetime to see this is where we are living we have enough water  
 this is a map of where we grow our food in the world
  this is the areas that we will rely on most for rice and maize and corn 
 people worry that there won 't be enough food but we know  if we just ate less meat and fed less of the crops to animals 
 there is enough food for everybody
 as long as we think of ourselves as one group of people  and we also know
  know
 about what we do
 so terribly badly nowadays you will have seen
 this map of the world before  this is the map produced
 by taking satellite images if you remember those satellites around the planet in the very first slide i showed
 and producing an image of what the earth looks like at night 
 when you normally see that map on a normal map the kind of map that most of you will be used to 
 you think you are seeing a map of where people live where the lights are shining up is where people live but here
  on this image of the world
 remember we 've stretched the map again 
 everywhere has the same density of people on this map 
 if an area doesn 't have people  we 've shrunk it away
 to make it disappear so we 're showing everybody with equal prominence 
 now the lights no longer show you where people are because people are everywhere now the lights
  on the map  the lights in london the lights in cairo the lights in tokyo the lights on the eastern seaboard of the united states the lights show you where people live
 who are so profligate with energy
 that they can afford to spend money powering lights to shine up into the sky
  satellites can draw an image like this 
 and the areas that are dark on the map are either areas where people do not have access to that much energy  
 or areas where people do  but they have learned to stop shining the light up into the sky  
 and if i could show you this map animated over time  
 you would see that tokyo has actually become darker  because ever since the tsunami in japan
 japan has had to rely on a quarter less electricity because it turned
 the nuclear power stations off and the world didn 't end  you just shone less light
 up into the sky  there are a huge number of good news stories
  infant mortality
 is falling and has been falling
 at an incredible rate a few years ago  
 the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world fell by five percent in just one year 
 more children are going to school and learning to read and write and getting connected to the internet and
  going on to go to university than ever before at an incredible rate  and the highest
 number of young people going to university in the world
 are women not men 
 i can give you good news story after good news story about what is getting better in the planet  but we tend
 to concentrate
 on the bad news that is immediate rebecca solnit  i think put it brilliantly  
 when she explained the accretion of incremental imperceptible changes
 which can constitute progress and which render our era dramatically different from the past the past was much more stable
  the undramatic nature of gradual transformation punctuated by occasional tumult occasionally terrible things happen 
 you are shown those terrible things
 on the news every night of the week  you are not told
 about the population slowing down  you are not told about the world becoming more connected  you are not told about the incredible
  improvements in understanding you are not told about how we are learning to begin to waste less and consume less this is my last map 
 on this map we have taken the seas and the oceans out now you are just looking
 at about seven point four billion people
 with the map drawn in proportion to those people you 're looking at over
  a billion in china and you can see the largest city in the world in china  but you do not know its name  you can see that india
 is in the center of this world  you can see that europe is on the edge  and we
 in exeter today are on the far edge of the
  we are on a tiny scrap of rock
 off europe
 which contains less
 than one percent of the world 's adults and less than half a percent
 of the world 's children 
 we are living in a stabilizing world an urbanizing world  an aging world a connecting world  there are many
  many things to be frightened about 
 but there is no need for us to fear each other as much as we do  and we need to see that we are now living
 in a new world  thank you very much
