 is about righting writing wrongs no the sound 's not faulty righting writing wrongs the middle east is huge 
 and with all our problems one thing 's for sure  we love to laugh  i think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences  we need to take our responsibilities
  seriously but not ourselves  
 don 't get me wrong it 's not like we don 't have comedy in the middle east i grew up at a time when iconic actors from kuwait syria  egypt used laughter to unite the region 
 just as football can 
 now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves before others can laugh with us this is the story of the rise and rise of
 a stand up uprising if you will 
 working in london as tv maker and writer i quickly realized that comedy connects
 audiences 
 now the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand up comedy circuit  where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly  
 an unfortunate connection for us maybe but it reminds me that
  we 'd like to thank one man for over the past decade working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world  specifically
 comedians with a middle eastern background 
 like my good friends dean and maysoon at the bottom of the screen who two years after nine eleven started a festival
 to change the way middle easterners are perceived in the world it 's still going strong
 with positive press to die for 
 also three guys working for years in los angeles an iranian a palestinian and an egyptian 
 created the aptly named axis of evil comedy act 
 and wherever they went  they killed  
 now i didn 't start this fire but i did pour petrol
  i moved to dubai as the head of original content for a western tv network my job was to connect the brand with a middle eastern audience 
 now the american head of programming
 wanted new local arabic comedy in a thick arabic accent my brain went berfect now  
 i had friends in the u s who
  had started a successful new tribe and i had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the middle east
 and pushing them over the tipping point towards success 
 now as with any new idea it wasn 't easy 
 i had four phases to this plan first we 'd need to buy content from the west and air it  then i 'd bring my friends and we 'd show local amateurs how it 's done  we would film that and air it  and then i could work 
  with the local amateurs and write new comedy i excitedly presented this to the big boss  and his reaction
  was um i don 't get it 
 so i retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub  
 now fast forward two years to early two thousand and seven 
 the earth rotated as did our management and as if
 by divine intervention
  came together to help this revolution
 take shape  here 's how the dots connected first the axis guys recorded a comedy central special that aired in the states  and it was getting great hits on youtube 
 our new french ceo believed in the power of positive pr and
 ideas du bon marche
  let 's just say value for money 
 i produced in dubai a show for ahmed ahmed to showcase his new axis special to a packed room i invited our new ceo and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels his reaction was very simple 
 let 's make this happen  
 and one more thing no don 't f it up so
 i quickly went to work with a great team around me
  i happened to find a funny guy to present it in arabic who is originally korean 
 a perfect fit for the axis of evil 
 this is all true  now while preparing for the tour  i had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive i used the three bs of stand up don 'ts as i call them in the middle east 
 blue content keep it clean beliefs not religion and the third b bolitics
  stay away from bolitics in the middle east oh course you might think what 's left without bolitics sex and religion how can you make people laugh  i 'd say watch any successful
  family friendly sitcom in the west for your answers  now  
 were the axis successful 
 in five countries in just under a month we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live we had millions see them on tv and on tv news 
 in jordan we had his majesty the king come and see them
 in fact they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their dvd even before it was released in the middle east  anywhere you go so
 everywhere we went  we auditioned amateurs we filmed that process and aired a documentary  i called it three guys and wonho 
 it really is his name 
 and all this tv and internet exposure
 has led to a great many recruits to our cause 
 in dubai this year we 've just had the first all women 's homegrown stand up show and notice two of them are wearing headscarves and yes even they can laugh 
 dubai to me is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen 
 twenty years ago no one had heard of it  look at it now with an inspirational
  leader i think this year  the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like
 adding a finger to that hand that points
 at all those who spread fallacious stories about us 
 now in three short years we 've come a long way with stand up comedy shows happening even
  comics are now going to the new york festival and the lebanese brilliant lebanese nemr abou nassar  we featured in our first tour has just been performing in l a ' s legendary comedy clubs so clearly from the inside we are doing our best to change our image and it 's exploding 
 so as for the outsiders looking in watch the cnn report on the second amman comedy festival the reporter
  did a great job and i thank her but somebody forgot to send the positive pr email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom for example when dean
 talks the ticker says u s suspect gave  ' actionable intel well if you 're used to listening to comedians then
 i 'm not surprised sadly this leads me to another three bs that represents how the media in the west talks
  angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel  we have a positive story to tell
 and image to sell in fact one thing 's for sure in my experience  we love to laugh
 like hell 
 here are three questions that i like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story
 one is the middle east being shown in a current time and correct context 
 two do the middle eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes
  is the middle eastern character being played by one 
 clearly  there are wrongs that need to be righted  we 've started in our region 
 my challenge to the rest of the world is
 please start using positive middle eastern images in your stories for inspiration go to one of our festivals go online  
 drop us a line let 's change the narrative together
 and let 's start righting
  writing wrongs i 'd like to end before going back to the middle east with a quote from one of the greatest sheikhs
 to put quill to parchment as my father likes to call him asheikh azubare as my mother would say
