  tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life schools hospitals
 workplaces
 factories offices etc and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of democratization of of intimacy
 and what do i mean by that i mean that what people are doing
 is in fact they are sort of with their communication channels they are breaking an imposed isolation
 that these institutions are imposing on them
  how are they doing this they 're doing it in a very simple way by calling their mom from work
 by iming from their office to their friends by texting under under the desk
 the pictures that you 're seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months
 and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most and somebody brought a boyfriend somebody a father one young woman brought her grandfather
 for twenty years i 've been looking at how people use channels such as email the mobile phone texting etc what we 're actually going to see is that fundamentally people are communicating 
 on a regular basis with five six seven of their most intimate sphere now lets take some data
  the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels and
 an average user
 said
 cameron marlow from from facebook has about one hundred and twenty friends but he actually talks to has two way exchanges with about four to six people on a regular base depending on his gender
 academic research on instant messaging also shows one hundred people on on buddy lists
 but fundamentally people chat with two three four anyway less than five
 my
  research on cellphones and
 and voice calls show that eighty percent of the calls are actually made to four people eighty percent and when you go to skype it 's down to two people
 a lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed i mean i 've been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment just for five people
 and some sociologists actually feel that
 's a closure it 's a cocooning that we 're disengaging from the public and i would actually i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it and from where they 're doing it actually there is an incredible social transformation
 there are three stories that i think are quite good examples the first gentleman he 's a baker and so he starts working every morning at four o 'clock in the morning
 and around eight o 'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven cleans his hands
  from the flour and calls his wife he just wants to wish her a good day because that 's the start of her day
 and i 've heard this story a number of times
 a young factory worker who works night shifts who manages to sneak away from the factory floor where there is cctv by the way and find a corner where at eleven 
  o 'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight or a mother who at four o 'clock
  a corner in the toilet to check that
 her children are safely home
 then there is another couple there is a brazilian couple they 've lived in italy for a number of years they skype with their families a few times a week
 but once a fortnight they actually put the computer on their dining table pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in sao paulo and they have a big event of it
 and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from
  very modest family of of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland they had set up a big screen in their living room and every morning they had breakfast with with their grandmother
 but danny miller who is a very good anthropologist who is working on on filipina migrant
 women who leave their children back in the philippines was telling me about how much parenting is going on through
 through skype and how much
 these mothers are engaged with their children
 through skype
 and then there is the third couple they are two friends they chat to each other every day a few times a day actually and finally finally they 've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work
 and now obviously they have it open whenever they have a moment they chat to each other
 and this is exactly what we 've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school
  under the table and texting under the table to their friends
 so none of these cases are unique i mean i could tell you hundreds of them but what is really exceptional is the setting
 so think of the three settings i 've talked to you about factory
 migration office but it could be in a school it could be an administration it could be a hospital
  three settings that if we just step back fifteen years if you just think back fifteen years
 when you when you clocked in when you clocked in to an office when you clocked in to to a factory there was no contact for the whole duration of the time there was no contact with your private 
  sphere if you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere
  you had a direct line if you were not maybe you had to go through an operator but basically when you walked into those buildings
 the private sphere was left behind you
 and and this has become such a norm of of our professional lives such a norm and such an expectation and it had nothing to do with technical
 capability the phones were there but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand fully to the people around
 that was where the focus had to be
 and this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to to be capable to do this cleavage if you think nursery kindergarten first years of school are 
  just dedicated to take away the children to make them used to staying long hours away from their family and then the school enacts perfectly well mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will start in offices
 rituals of exit the schedules the
 the uniforms in this country things that identify you team building activities team building that will allow you to to basically
 be with a random group of kids or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time and and of course the major thing
 learn to pay attention to concentrate and focus your attention this only started
  about one hundred and fifty years ago it only started with the the birth of modern bureaucracy and of industrial revolution when people basically had to
 go somewhere else to work and carry out the work and when with with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere
 so until then basically people were living on top of their trades they were living on top of the land they were
  laboring they were living on top of the workshops where they were working
 and and if you think it 's permeated our whole culture even our cities if you think of medieval cities medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of of the guilds and professions that 
  lived there now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas
  and commercial areas
 and actually over these one hundred and fifty years there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged so the lower
 the status of the job and of the person carrying out the more removed he would be from his personal sphere
 people have taken this amazing possibility
 of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations and they are doing it massively
  the pew institute which produces
 good data on a regular basis on for instance in the states says that and i think that this number is conservative fifty percent of of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email
 from his office i really think that the number is conservative
 in my own research we saw that the peak for private email is actually eleven o 'clock in the morning
 whatever the country seventy five percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on
  on their mobile phones one hundred percent
 are using text the point is that this reappropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions i 'm always surprised the u s army 
 sociologist are discussing of the impact for instance of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families
 and every day every single day i read news that makes me cringe like a fifteen dollar fine to kids in texas for using
 every time they take out their mobile phone in school
 immediate dismissal to bus drivers in new york if seen with a mobile phone in a hand
 companies blocking access to
  security and safety which have always been the arguments for social control in fact what is going on is that
 these institutions are trying to decide who in fact has a right to self determine their attention to decide whether they should or not be isolated and
  they are actually trying to to block in a certain sense this movement of
