  i 'm really scared  i don 't think we 're going to make it 
 probably by now most of you have seen al gore 's amazing talk shortly after i saw that we had some
 friends over for dinner with the family  the conversation turned
  to global warming  and everybody agreed 
 there 's a real problem we 've got a climate crisis  so we went around the table to talk about what we should do 
 the conversation came to my  15 year old daughter  mary she said i agree with everything that 's been said 
 i 'm scared and i 'm angry
  and then she turned to me and said dad  your generation created this problem you 'd better fix it wow 
 all the conversation stopped all the eyes turned to me 
 i didn 't know what to say 
 kleiner 's second law
  time when panic is the appropriate response and
 we 've reached that time 
 we cannot afford to underestimate this problem if we face irreversible
 and catastrophic consequences we must act and we must act decisively i 've got to tell you for me everything changed that evening
 and so my partners and i we set off on this mission
 to learn more  to try to do much more so 
 we mobilized we got on airplanes we went to brazil we went to china and to india to
 bentonville arkansas to washington d c and to sacramento and so  what i 'd like to do now is to
 tell you about what we 've learned in those journeys  because the more we learned the more concerned we grew
  you know my partners at kleiner and i were compulsive networkers and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity
 like avian flu or personalized medicine we just get together the smartest people we know for this climate crisis  we assembled a
 network really of superstars from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs
  business leaders fifty or so of them and so  i want to tell you about what we 've learned in doing that
 and four lessons i 've learned in the last year  the first lesson is that companies are really powerful and that matters a lot 
 this is a story about how wal mart went green and what that means two years ago  the ceo lee scott 
 believed that green is the next big
  going green a top priority  
 they committed that they 're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by twenty percent and their new stores by thirty percent and do all that in seven years  
 the three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning  then lighting  and then refrigeration 
 so look what they did they painted the roofs of all their stores white  
 they put smart skylights through
  their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands and third they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with  led lighting 
 i mean why would you try to refrigerate a whole store 
 these are really simple smart solutions based on existing technology why does wal mart matter  well  it 's massive
  the largest private employer in america they 're the largest private user of electricity they have the 
  vehicle fleet on the road and they have one of the world 's most amazing supply chains sixty thousand suppliers 
 if wal mart were a country it would be the sixth largest trading partner with china 
 and maybe most important  they have a big effect on other companies when
  it 's going to go green and be profitable it has a powerful impact on other great institutions so 
 let me tell you this when wal mart achieves twenty percent energy reductions that 's going to be a very big deal  
 but i 'm afraid it 's not enough we need wal mart and every other company
 to do the same the second thing that we learned is that individuals matter  and they matter enormously i 've got another wal mart story for you ok
 wal mart has over one hundred and twenty five million u s customers that 's a third of the u s population
  million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year
 and wal mart has committed they 're going to sell another one hundred million light bulbs in the coming year  but it 's not easy 
  consumers don 't really like these light bulbs the light 's kind of funny they won 't dim takes a while for them to start up
 but the pay off is really enormous one hundred million compact fluorescent light bulbs
 means that
 we 'll save six hundred million dollars in energy bills and twenty million tons of co2 every year 
 year in and year out 
 it does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing it is stupid that we use two
  tons of steel glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall  it 's stupid
 that we put water in plastic bottles in fiji and ship it here it
 's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don 't know how much this stuff
  do you know do you know how much co2 you generated to
 drive here or fly here  i don 't know and i should those of us who care about all this would act better if if we knew what
 the real costs were but as long as we pretend that co2 is free as long as these uses are nearly invisible how can we expect change 
 i 'm really afraid because i think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals
  are going to be clearly not enough  
 the third lesson we learned is that policy matters  it really matters in fact policy is paramount i
 've got a behind the scenes story for you about that green tech network i described  at the end of our first meeting we got together to talk about what the action items would be how we 'd follow up  
 and bob epstein
 raised a hand he stood up
  bob 's that berkeley techie type who started sybase well bob said the most important thing we could do right now
 is to make it clear in sacramento california
 that we need a market based system of mandates that 's going to cap and reduce
 greenhouse gases in california it 's necessary and just as important  it 's good for the california economy so
  eight of us went to sacramento in august and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for 
 you know what six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill so it passed and it passed by a vote of 
  thank you 
 i think it 's the most important legislation of two thousand and six why 
 because california was the first state in this country to mandate twenty five percent reduction of greenhouse gases by two thousand and twenty 
 and the result of that is we 're going to generate  eighty three thousand new jobs four billion dollars a year in annual income 
 and reduce the co2 emissions by one hundred and seventy four million tons a year 
 california emits only seven percent of
 co2 emissions it 's only a percent and a half of the country 's co2 emissions it 's a great start but i 've got to tell you
 where i started i 'm really afraid in fact i 'm certain california 's not enough 
 here 's a story about national policy that we could all learn from you know tom friedman says if you don 't go you don 't know 
  we went to brazil to meet dr jose goldemberg  he 's the father of the ethanol revolution he told us that brazil 's government mandated
 that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol and they mandated that
 their new vehicles would be flex fuel compatible right they 'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline  and so here 's what 's happened in brazil they now have
  ethanol pumps this versus seven hundred in the u s and a paltry two in california
 and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to eighty five percent flex fuel 
 compare that to the u s five percent are flex fuel and you know what most consumers who have them don 't even know it 
 so  what 's happened in brazil is they 've replaced forty percent of the gasoline
  that they didn 't ship to the middle east it 's created a million jobs inside that country and it 's saved thirty two million tons of co2 it 's really substantial that 's ten percent of the co2 emissions across their entire country 
 but brazil 's only one point three percent of the world 's co2 emission 
 so brazil 's ethanol miracle i 'm really afraid is not enough
 in fact  i 'm afraid all of the best policies we have
 are not going to be
 enough  
 the fourth and final lesson we 've learned is about the potential of radical innovation so i want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology 
 every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease
  that 's malaria six thousand people a day 
 all for want of two dollars ' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore well two dollars two dollars
 is too much for africa so a team of berkeley researchers with fifteen million dollars from the gates foundation is
 engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called artemisinin
 and they 're going to make that drug ten times cheaper and in doing so
  a million lives at least a million lives a year a million lives 
 their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology this leverages millions of years of evolution
 by redesigning bugs to make really useful products now what you do is you get inside the microbe you change its metabolic pathways and
 you end up with a living chemical factory now you may ask john what has this got to go with green and
  with climate crisis well i 'll tell you a lot  we 've now formed a company called amyris and this technology that they 're using can be used to make
 better biofuels don
 't let me skip over that better biofuels are a really big deal that means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way 
 so  if all goes well  they 're going to have designer
  bugs in warm vats that are
 eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels  i guess that 's
 better living through bugs  alan kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it and of course at
 kleiner we kind of apologize and say the second best way is to finance it and that 's why we 're investing
 two
  hundred million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies 
 and we 're encouraging others to do it as well we 're talking a lot about this 
 in two thousand and five there were six hundred million dollars invested in
 new technologies of the sort you see here it doubled in two thousand and six to one point two billion dollars but i 'm really afraid
 we need much much more
 for reference fact one exxon 's revenues in two thousand and five were a billion dollars a day do you
 know they only invested zero point two percent of revenues in r & d second fact  the president 's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total 
 less than one day of exxon 's revenues 
 third fact
  i bet you didn 't know that there 's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america 's energy needs for the next thousand years 
 and the federal budget calls for a measly twenty million dollars of r & d in geothermal energy it is almost criminal
 that we are not investing more in energy research in this country and i am really afraid that it 's
 's absolutely not enough 
 so in a year 's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green who would have thought that a database entrepreneur
 could transform california with legislation who would have thought that the
 ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in south america  and who would have thought that
 scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs
  and who would have thought that all that is not enough 
 not enough to stabilize the climate not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean 
 the scientists tell us and they 're only guessing that we 've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half 
 and do it as fast as possible now we may have the political will to do this in the u s 
 but i 've got to tell you we 've got
  only one atmosphere  and so somehow we 're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world  
 the wild card in this deck is china to size the problem china 's co2 emissions today
 are three point three gigatons the u s is five point eight 
 business as usual means we 'll have twenty three gigatons from china by two thousand and fifty 
 that 's about as much co2 as there is in the whole world and if it 's business as usual we 're going out of business
 when i was in davos china 's mayor of dalian was pressed about their co2 strategy and he said the following you know  
 americans use seven times the co2 per capita as chinese 
 then he asked why should china sacrifice our growth so that the west can continue to be profligate and stupid 
 does anybody here have
  we 've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations
 make the right outcome the profitable outcome and therefore the likely outcome energy 's a six trillion dollar business worldwide it is the mother of all markets  
 you remember that internet well i
 'll tell you what green technologies going green is bigger than the internet it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the
  moreover  if we succeed it 's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since as bill joy says we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere  
 now  
 here 's the hard question if the trajectory
 of all the world 's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not
  going to be enough what are we going to do 
 i don 't know  everyone here cares about changing the world
 and has made a difference in that one way or another  so  our call to action
 my call to you is for you to make going green your next big thing  your gig what can you
  and buy carbon credits  you could join other leaders in
 mandating lobbying for mandated cap and trade in u s greenhouse gas reductions  there 's six bills right now in congress let 's get one of them passed
