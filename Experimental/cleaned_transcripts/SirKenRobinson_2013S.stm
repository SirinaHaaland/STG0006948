  i moved to america twelve years ago with my wife terry and our two kids actually truthfully we moved to los angeles
  it 's a short plane ride from los angeles to america 
 i got here twelve years ago and when i got here i was told various things like 
 americans don 't get irony 
 have you come across this idea it 's not true i 've traveled the whole
  length and breadth of this country  i have found no evidence that americans don 't get irony  it 's one of those cultural myths 
 like the british are reserved 
 i don 't know why people think this  we 've invaded every country we 've encountered 
 laughter but it 's not true americans don 't get irony but i i just want you to know that that 's what people are saying
  about you behind your back you know so when you leave living rooms in europe people say  thankfully nobody was ironic in your presence 
 but i knew that americans get irony when i came across that legislation no child left behind 
 because whoever thought of that title
 gets
  because it 's leaving millions of children behind  now i can see that 's not a very attractive name for legislation millions of children left behind i can see that 
 what 's the plan we propose to leave millions of children behind  and here 's how it 's
  in some parts of the country sixty percent of kids drop out of high school in the native american communities it 's eighty percent
 of kids if we halved that number one estimate is it would
 create a net gain to the u s economy over ten years of nearly a trillion dollars
  that we should do this  it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from
 the dropout crisis but the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg what it doesn 't count are all the kids who are in school
 but being disengaged from it  who don 't enjoy it who don 't get any real benefit from it 
  have to labor and most students have to endure  the first is this that human beings are naturally
 different and diverse can i ask you how many of you have got children of your own
 okay or grandchildren  how about two children or more right  and the rest of you have seen such children
 small people wandering about 
 i will make you a bet and i am confident that i will win the bet if you 've got two children or more i bet you
 they are completely different from each other
  system so we don 't get confused 
 education under no child left behind is based on not diversity but conformity 
 what schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement 
 one of the effects of no child left behind has been
  to narrow the focus onto the so called stem disciplines they 're very important  i 'm not here to argue against science and math on the contrary  
 they 're necessary but they 're not sufficient 
 a real education has to give equal weight to the arts  the humanities to physical education an awful lot of kids
 in america currently is that something like ten percent of kids getting on that way are being diagnosed with various conditions
 under the broad
 title of attention deficit disorder 
  not saying there 's no such thing i just don 't believe it 's an epidemic like this  if you sit kids down hour after hour
 don 't be surprised if they start to fidget you know 
 children are not for the most part suffering from a psychological condition they 're suffering from childhood 
  and i know this because i spent my early life as a child i went through the whole thing 
 kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents not just a small range of them and by the way 
  the arts aren 't just important because they improve math scores they 're important because they speak to parts of children 's being which are otherwise untouched  
  the second
 principle that drives human life flourishing
 is curiosity  
 if you can light the spark of curiosity in a child  
 they will learn without any further assistance very often 
 children are natural learners  it 's a real achievement to put that particular ability out or to stifle it
 of achievement now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here if i can say so has been to 
 teachers  there is no system in the world or
 any school in the country that is better than its teachers teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools but
  teaching is a creative profession teaching properly conceived is not a delivery system you know
 you 're not there just to pass on received information great teachers do that 
 but what great teachers also do is mentor  stimulate provoke engage you see in the end education is about learning
  if there 's no learning going on there 's no education going on and people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning the whole point of education is to get people to learn an old
 friend of mine actually very old he 's dead 
 that 's as old as it gets i 'm afraid 
 but a wonderful guy
  wonderful philosopher he used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs
 you can be engaged in the activity of something but not really be achieving it like dieting it
 's a very good example  there he is he 's dieting is he losing any weight not really 
 teaching is a word like that
  she 's in room thirty four she 's teaching but if nobody 's learning anything  she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it 
 the role of a teacher is to facilitate
 learning that 's it 
 and part of the problem is i think that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning  but testing now
 testing is important
  standardized tests have a place 
 but they should not be the dominant culture of education they should be diagnostic they should help 
 if i go for a medical examination  
 i want some standardized tests i do
  i want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else 's
  but all that should support learning it shouldn 't obstruct it which of course it often does 
 so in place of curiosity what we have is a culture of compliance
 our children and teachers are encouraged to follow
 routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity  and the third principle is this that human life is inherently creative  
 it 's why we all have different rsums 
 we create our lives and we can recreate them as we go through them it 's the common currency of being a human being 
 it 's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic  i mean  other animals may
  well have imaginations and creativity but it 's not so much in evidence is it  as ours i mean you may have a dog
   and your dog may get depressed you know
 but it doesn 't listen to radiohead does it and
 sit staring out the window with a bottle of jack daniels
  we all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities and one one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of
  what we have is a culture of standardization now it doesn 't have to be that way  it really doesn 't finland
 regularly comes out on top in math science and reading  now  
 we only know that 's what they do well at because that 's all that 's being tested that 's one of the problems of the test they don 't look for other things that matter just as much  
 the thing about
 work in finland is this  they don 't obsess about those disciplines  they have a very broad approach to
  education which includes humanities physical education  the arts 
 second
  there is no standardized testing in finland  
 i mean there 's a bit  but it 's not what gets people up in the morning what keeps them at their desks 
 the third thing and i was at a meeting recently with some people from finland actual finnish
  and somebody from the american system was saying to the people in finland what do you do about the drop out rate
 in finland and they all looked a bit bemused and said well we don 't have one 
 why would you drop out if people are in trouble  we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them now people always say
  it to a state in america 
 many states in america have fewer people in them than that 
 i mean  i 've been to some states in america and i was the only person there really 
 really i was asked to lock up when i left 
  but what all the high performing systems in the world do
 is currently what is not evident  sadly across the systems in america
 i mean  as a whole one is this  they individualize teaching and learning  
 they recognize that it 's students who are learning
 and the system has to engage them their curiosity their
  and their creativity  that 's how you get them to learn  the second is that they
 attribute a very high status to the teaching profession  they recognize that you can 't improve education if you don 't pick great people to teach and
 keep giving them constant support and professional development 
 investing in professional development is not a cost it 's an investment and every other country that 's succeeding well knows that whether it 's australia
  korea  singapore hong kong or shanghai  they know that to be the case  and the third is they devolve responsibility
 to the school level for getting the job done  you see there 's a big difference here
 between going into a mode of command and control in education that 's what happens in some systems
  or state governments decide they know best and they 're going to tell you what to do the trouble is that
 education doesn 't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings  
 it happens in classrooms and schools  and the people who do it are the teachers and the students  and if you remove their discretion it stops working 
 you have to
  there is wonderful work happening in this country 
 but i have to say it 's happening in spite of the dominant culture of education not because of it it 's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time  
 and
 the the reason i think is this  that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions
 of education it 's like education is an industrial process that can
  be improved just by having better data  
 and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine tune it well enough if we just get it right it will all hum along perfectly into the future 
 it won 't and it never did 
 the point is that education
 is not a mechanical system it
  it 's about people people who either do want to learn or don 't want to learn every student who drops out of school has a reason for it
 which is rooted in their own biography  they may find it boring  they may find it irrelevant
  they may find that it 's at odds with the life they 're living outside of school there are trends  but the stories are always
  i was at a meeting recently in los angeles of they 're called alternative education programs these are programs designed to get kids back into education  
 they have certain common features they 're very personalized  
 they have strong support for the teachers  
 close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside
  and all the evidence from around the world is if we all did that there 'd be no need for the alternative 
 so i think we have to embrace a different metaphor 
 we have to recognize that it 's a human system  and there are
  under which people thrive and conditions under which they don 't  we are after all organic creatures  and
 the culture of the school is absolutely essential culture is an organic term isn 't it not far from where i live is a place called death valley 
  driest place in america and nothing grows there nothing grows there because it doesn 't rain hence death valley 
 in the
 winter of two thousand and four it rained
 in death valley  seven inches of rain fell over a very short period and in the spring
  of two thousand and five there was a phenomenon the whole floor of death valley was carpeted in flowers
 for a while what it proved is this  that death valley isn 't dead  it 's dormant 
 right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility
 waiting for the right conditions to come about
  and with organic systems  if the conditions are right life
 is inevitable  
 it happens all the time  you take an area a school a district you change the conditions give people a different sense of possibility a different set of expectations a broader range 
  of opportunities  you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners  you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do 
  real role of leadership in education and i think it 's true at the national level the state level at the school level
 is not and should not be command and control  
 the real role of leadership is climate control  
 creating a climate of possibility  
 and if you do that people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn 't have expected 
  wonderful quote from benjamin franklin there are three sorts of people in the world 
 those who are immovable 
 people who don 't get it or don 't want to  do anything about it  there are people who are movable people who see the need for change and are
 prepared to listen to it and there are people who move people who make things happen and
  if we can encourage more people that will be a movement  and if the movement is strong enough that 's in the best sense of the word a revolution 
 and that 's what we need thank you very much
