  so as a fashion designer i 've always tended to think of materials something like this or this 
 or maybe this 
 but then i met a biologist  and now i think of materials like this
 green tea sugar a few microbes and a little time  
 i 'm essentially using a kombucha recipe  
 which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria  yeasts and other micro organisms which spin cellulose
 in a fermentation process over time  these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface
  so we start by brewing the tea i brew up to about thirty liters of tea at a time  and then while it 's still hot add a couple of kilos of sugar 
 we stir this in until it 's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath 
 we need to check that the temperature has cooled to below thirty degrees c and then we 're ready to add the
  and along with that some acetic acid  and once you get this process going you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid  
 we need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth 
 and i use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it 
 and actually in hot weather i can just grow it outside so this is my mini fabric farm 
 after about three days the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid so this is telling us that the fermentation is in
  full swing  
 and the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid  so they 're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose and they 're sticking together  forming layers 
 and giving us a sheet on the surface after about two to three weeks we 're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness  
  left is after five days  and on the right after ten 
 and this is a static culture you don 't
 have to do anything to it you just literally watch it grow it doesn 't need light and when it 's ready to harvest you take it out of the bath
 and you wash it in cold soapy water 
 at this point it 's really heavy  it 's over ninety percent water so we need to let that evaporate so i spread it out onto a wooden sheet  
  you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air  
 and as it 's drying it 's compressing  so what you 're left with depending on the recipe is something that 's either like a really light weight transparent paper 
 or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather  
 and then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally or you can use the wet material to form it around a three dimensional shape  and as it
  it will knit itself together forming seams 
 so the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea  i guess it also looks a little bit like human skin which intrigues me 
 since it 's organic 
 i 'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals i can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation using fruit and vegetable staining  create organic
  and in fact cotton would take up to eighteen dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark  and because of the 
  of this kind of cellulose it just takes one and a really short one at that 
 what i can 't yet do is make it  water resistant so if i was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today 
 i would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water
  the dress would get really heavy  and eventually the seams would probably fall apart leaving me feeling rather naked  
 possibly a good performance piece but definitely not ideal for everyday wear 
 what i 'm looking for
 is
 a way to give the material the qualities that i need  so what i want to do is say
  to a future bug spin me a thread  
 align it in this direction make it hydrophobic  and while you 're at it just form it around this 3d shape 
 bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing  and possibly in the future for
 biocompatible blood vessels possibly even replacement bone tissue  but with synthetic
  we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium
 to produce something that gives us the quality quantity and shape of material that we desire  
 obviously as a designer that 's really exciting because then i start to think wow  we could actually imagine growing consumable products 
 what excites me about using microbes is their efficiency  so we only grow
  what we need there 's no waste 
 and in fact we could make it from a waste stream so for example a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant  
 finally at the end of use we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings 
 what i 'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton leather or other textile materials
 but
 i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources  
 ultimately maybe it won 't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact we could for example imagine growing a lamp 
 a chair a car
 or maybe even a house  so i
  part of the project 's still in process because this one is is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes
