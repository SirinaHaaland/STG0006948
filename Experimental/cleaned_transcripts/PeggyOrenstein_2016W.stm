  for several years now we 've been engaged in a national debate about sexual assault on campus 
 no question it 's crucial that young people understand the ground rules for consent  
 but that 's where the conversation about sex is ending and in that vacuum of
  information the media and the internet that new digital street corner are educating our kids for us 
 if we truly want young people to engage safely  ethically  and yes  enjoyably 
 it 's time to have open honest discussion
  and that includes breaking the biggest taboo of all and talking to young people about women 's capacity for and entitlement to sexual pleasure 
 yeah come on
 ladies 
 i spent three years talking to girls ages fifteen to twenty about their attitudes and experience of sex
  and what i found was that while young women may feel entitled to engage in sexual behavior they don 't necessarily feel entitled to enjoy it  
 take this sophomore at the ivy league college who told me i come from a long line of smart strong women my grandmother was a firecracker my mom 
  is a professional my sister and i are loud and that 's our form of feminine power 
 starting when she was thirteen that were not especially responsible not especially reciprocal
 and not especially enjoyable 
 she shrugged i guess we girls are just socialized to be these docile creatures who don 't express our wants or needs 
 wait a minute i replied didn 't you just tell me what a smart strong woman you are she hemmed and hawed
  hawed i guess she finally said no one told me that that smart strong image applies to sex 
 i should probably say right up top that despite the hype  teenagers are not engaging in intercourse more often or at a younger age than they were twenty five years ago 
 they are however engaging in other behavior 
 and when we ignore that when we label that as
  sex that opens the door to risky behavior and disrespect 
 that 's particularly true of oral sex which teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse 
 girls would tell me it 's no big deal like they 'd all read the same instruction manual
 at least if boys were on the receiving end young women have lots of reasons for participating
  it made them feel desired  it was a way to boost social status sometimes it was a way to get out of an uncomfortable situation 
 as a freshman at a west coast college said to me 
 a girl will give a guy a blow job at the end of the night because she doesn 't want to have sex with him and he expects to be satisfied 
 so if i want him to leave and i don 't want anything to happen
  heard so many stories of girls performing one sided oral sex that i started asking 
 what if every time you were alone with a guy he told you to get him a glass of water from the kitchen  and he never got you a glass of water
 or if he did it was like '
 you want me to uh ' you know  totally begrudging you wouldn 't stand for it
 but it wasn 't always that boys didn 't want to it was that girls didn 't want them to 
 girls expressed a sense of shame around their genitals a sense that they were simultaneously icky
 and sacred women 's feelings about their genitals have been directly linked to their enjoyment of sex yet
  a researcher at indiana university  believes that girls 
 is under siege with more pressure than ever to see them as unacceptable
 in their natural state  according to research about  three quarters of college women remove their pubic hair
 all of it at least on occasion and more than half do so regularly 
  girls would tell me that
 hair removal made them feel cleaner that it was a personal choice
  though i kind of wondered if left alone on a desert island if this was how they would choose to spend their time 
 and when i pushed further a darker motivation emerged  avoiding humiliation guys act like they would be disgusted
  young woman told me no one wants to be talked about like that 
 the rising pubic hair removal reminded me of the 1920s when women first started regularly shaving their armpits and their legs 
 that 's when flapper dresses came into style  and women 's limbs were suddenly visible open to public scrutiny  
 there 's a way that i think that this too is a sign that a girl
  most intimate part
 is open to public scrutiny  
 open to critique to becoming more about how it looks to someone else than how it feels to her 
 the shaving trend has sparked another rise in 
  which is the trimming of the inner and outer labia
  cosmetic surgery among teenage girls it rose eighty percent
  between two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and fifteen 
 and whereas girls under eighteen comprise two percent of all cosmetic surgeries they are five percent of labiaplasty 
 the most sought after look incidentally in which the outer labia appear fused like a clam shell is called  wait for it 
  i trust i don 't have to tell you that barbie is a made of plastic and b has no genitalia 
 the labiaplasty trend has become so worrisome that the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists has issued a statement on the procedure  which is rarely medically indicated 
 has not been proven safe and whose side effects
 include
  scarring  numbness pain
 and diminished sexual sensation 
 now admittedly  and blessedly  the number of girls involved is still quite small  
 but you could see them as canaries in a coal mine telling us something important about the way girls see their bodies  
 sara mcclelland a psychologist at the university of michigan
  coined what is my favorite phrase ever in talking about all of this intimate justice 
 that 's the idea that sex has political as well as personal implications just like  
 who does the dishes in your house or who vacuums the rug  and it raises similar issues about
  physical and mental health intimate justice asks us to consider
 who is entitled to engage in an experience who is entitled to enjoy it  
 who is the primary beneficiary  and how does each partner define good enough 
 honestly i think those questions are tricky and sometimes traumatic for adult women to confront
 but when we 're talking about girls i just kept coming back to the idea that their early sexual experience shouldn 't have to be something that they get over 
 in her work mcclelland found that young women were more likely than young men to use their partner 's pleasure as a measure of their satisfaction 
 so they 'd say things like if he 's
  sexually satisfied  then i 'm sexually satisfied young men were more likely to measure their satisfaction
 by their own orgasm young women also defined bad sex differently 
 in the largest ever survey ever conducted on american sexual behavior they
  the young men
 never used that language 
 so when young women report sexual satisfaction levels that are equal to or greater than young men 's
 and they do in research
 that can be deceptive if a girl goes into an encounter
  encounter hoping that it won 't hurt wanting to feel close to her partner and expecting him to have an orgasm she
 'll be satisfied if those criteria are met  
 and there 's nothing wrong with wanting to feel close to your partner or wanting him to be happy and orgasm isn 't the only measure of an experience  
 but absence of pain
 that 's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment
 listening to all of this and thinking about it i began to realize that we performed a kind of psychological 
 on american girls  starting in infancy parents of baby boys are more likely to name all their body parts at least they 'll say here 's your pee pee 
 parents of baby girls go right from navel to knees and they leave this whole situation in here
 unnamed
 there 's no better way to make something unspeakable
 than not to name it  
 then kids go into their puberty education classes and they learn that boys have erections and ejaculations 
 and girls have periods
 and unwanted pregnancy  and they see that internal diagram of a woman 's reproductive system you know the one that looks kind of like a steer head
 and it always grays out between the legs  
 so we never say vulva 
 we certainly never say clitoris no surprise fewer than half of teenage girls age fourteen to seventeen have ever masturbated  
 and then they go into their partnered experience and we expect that somehow they 'll think sex
  about them that they 'll be able to articulate their needs their desires their limits it 's unrealistic  
 here 's something though 
 girls ' investment in their partner 's pleasure remains regardless of the gender of the partner so in same sex encounters 
  and young women climax at the same rate as men 
 lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me that they felt liberated to get off the script free to create an encounter that worked for them 
 gay girls also challenged the idea of first intercourse as the definition of virginity  not because intercourse isn 't a big deal  
 but it 's worth questioning why we consider this one act which most girls
  with discomfort or pain to be the line in the sand of sexual adulthood
 so much more meaningful so much more transformative than anything else  
 and it 's worth considering how this is serving girls  whether it 's keeping them safer from disease  coercion betrayal assault
  whether it 's encouraging mutuality and caring 
 what it means about the way they see other sex acts  whether it 's giving them more control over and joy in their experience 
 and what it means about gay teens who can have multiple sex partners without heterosexual intercourse 
 so i asked a gay girl that i met how 'd you know you weren 't a virgin anymore 
 she said she had to google it
  and google wasn 't sure 
 she finally decided that she wasn 't a virgin anymore after she 'd had her first orgasm with a partner 
 and i thought
 whoa what if just for a second we imagined that was the definition 
  not because intercourse isn 't a big deal of course it is but it isn 't the only big deal  
 and rather than thinking about sex as a race to a goal this helps us reconceptualize it
 as a pool of experiences
 that include warmth affection  arousal desire  touch  intimacy  
 and it 's worth asking young people who 's really the more sexually experienced person
 the one who makes out with a partner for three hours and experiments with sensual tension and communication 
 or the one who gets wasted at a party and hooks up with a random in order to dump their virginity before they get to college 
 the only way that shift in thinking can happen though
 is if we talk to young people more about sex if we normalize
  those discussions  integrating them into everyday life talking about those intimate acts in a different way the way we
 mostly have changed in the way that we talk about women in the public realm 
 consider a survey of three hundred randomly chosen girls from a dutch and an american
  two similar universities talking about their early experience of sex  
 the dutch girls embodied everything we say we want from our girls 
 they had fewer negative consequences like disease pregnancy  regret
 more positive outcomes like being able to communicate with their partner who they said they knew very well  preparing for the experience responsibly  enjoying themselves 
 what was their secret 
  dutch girls said that their doctors  teachers and parents talked to them candidly from an early age about sex pleasure
 and the importance of mutual trust 
 what 's more while american parents weren 't necessarily less comfortable talking about sex 
 we tend to frame those conversations entirely in terms
  danger  whereas dutch parents talk about balancing responsibility and joy  
 i have to tell you as a parent myself that hit me hard because i know 
 had i not delved into that research i would have talked to my own child about
  about disease protection about consent because i 'm a modern parent and i would have thought 
 job well done now i know
 that 's not enough  i also know what i hope for for our girls  i want them to see sexuality as a source of 
 creativity and communication
  despite its potential risks  i want them to be able to revel in their bodies ' sensuality without being reduced to it  
 i want them to be able to ask for what they want in bed and to get it  
 i want them to be safe from unwanted pregnancy  disease  cruelty  dehumanization  
 violence  
 if they are
  i want them to have recourse from their schools their employers the courts 
 it 's a lot to ask  but it 's not too much 
 as parents teachers advocates and activists we have raised a generation of girls to have a voice 
 to expect egalitarian treatment
 in the home in the classroom in the workplace  now it 's time
  to demand that intimate justice in their personal lives as well  thank you
