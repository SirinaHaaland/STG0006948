  robert spent the last few years think about how weird human behavior is and how inadequate most of our language trying to explain it is and it 's
 very exciting to hear him explain some of the thinking behind it in public for the first time
 thank you the
 fantasy always runs something like this 
 i 've overpowered his elite guard  burst into his secret bunker with my machine gun ready 
 he lunges for his luger i knock it out of his hand he lunges for his cyanide pill i knock that out of his hand  he snarls
 comes at me with otherworldly strength we grapple we fight i manage to pin him down and put on handcuffs 
 adolf hitler i say i arrest you for crimes against humanity 
 here 's where the medal of honor version of the fantasy ends and the imagery darkens  what would i do if i had hitler it
 's not hard to imagine once i allow myself
 sever his spine at the neck 
 take out his eyes with a blunt instrument puncture his eardrums  cut out his tongue leave him alive on a respirator tube fed not able to speak or move or see or hear just to feel  
 and then inject him with something cancerous that 's going to fester
  every cell in his body is screaming in agony  until every second feels like an eternity in hell 
 that 's what i would do to hitler  
 i 've had this fantasy since i was a kid still do sometimes  and when i do my heart speeds up
 all these plans for the most evil wicked soul in history  but there 's a problem which is i don 't actually believe in souls or evil
  and i think wicked belongs in a musical  
 but there 's some people i would like to see killed but
 i 'm against the death penalty  but i like schlocky violent movies  but i 'm for strict gun control but then there was a time i was at a laser tag place and i had such a good time hiding in a corner shooting at people 
 in other words i 'm your basic confused human when it comes to violence 
 now as a species we
  obviously have problems with violence 
 we use shower heads to deliver poison gas letters with anthrax airplanes as weapons mass rape as a military strategy we 're a miserably violent species but
 there 's a complication  which is we don 't hate violence  we hate the wrong kind  
 and when it 's the right kind
  we cheer it on we hand out medals  we vote for we mate with our champions of it when it 's the right kind of violence we love it 
 and there 's another complication  which is in addition to us being this miserably violent species we 're also this extraordinarily altruistic compassionate one  
 so how do you make sense of the biology of our best behaviors our worst ones and all of those ambiguously in between 
 now for starters  what 's totally
  boring is understanding the motoric aspects of the behavior your brain tells your spine tells your muscles to do something or other and hooray you 've behaved  
 what 's hard is understanding the meaning of the behavior  because in some settings  pulling a trigger is an appalling act in others it 's heroically 
 in some settings putting your hand one someone else 's is deeply compassionate
 others it 's a deep betrayal  the challenge is to understand the biology of the context of our behaviors  and that 's real tough 
 one thing that 's clear though is you 're not going to get anywhere if you think there 's going to be the brain region or the hormone or the gene or the childhood experience or the evolutionary mechanism that explains everything 
 instead every bit
  of behavior has multiple levels of causality  let 's look at an example you have a gun 
 there 's a crisis going on rioting violence people running around a stranger is running at you in an agitated state you can 't quite tell if the expression is frightened threatening angry
 holding something that kind of looks like a handgun you 're not sure the
  comes running at you and you pull the trigger  and it turns out that thing in this person 's hand was a cell phone 
 so we asked this biological question  what was going on that caused this behavior what caused this behavior  
 and this is a multitude of questions we start  what was going on in your brain one second before you pulled that trigger  
 and this brings us into the realm
  of a brain region called the amygdala the amygdala which is central to violence  central to fear  initiates volleys of cascades that produce pulling 
  of a trigger  what was the level of activity in your amygdala one second before 
  obviously the sights the sounds of the rioting that was pertinent but in addition you 're more likely to mistake a cell phone for a handgun
 if that stranger was male
 and large and of a different race  
 furthermore if you 're in pain if you 're hungry if you 're exhausted your frontal cortex is not going to work as well  part of the brain whose job it is to get to the amygdala in time
  saying are you really sure that 's a gun there 
 but we need to step further back 
 now we have to look at hours to days before  and with this we have entered the realm of hormones for example testosterone where regardless of your sex 
 if you have elevated testosterone levels in your blood you 're more likely to think a face with a neutral expression is instead looking threatening
  testosterone levels elevated levels of stress hormones and your amygdala is going to be more active and your frontal cortex will be more sluggish 
 pushing back further weeks to months before where 's the relevance there this is the realm of neural plasticity  the fact that your brain can change in response to experience 
 and if your previous months have been filled with stress and trauma your amygdala
  will have enlarged the neurons will have become more excitable your frontal cortex would have atrophied all relevant to what happens in that one second  
 but we push back even more back years back for example to your adolescence now the central fact of the adolescent brain is all of it is going full blast except
  the frontal cortex which is still half baked it doesn 't fully mature until you 're around  twenty five 
 and thus adolescence and early adulthood are the years where environment and experience sculpt your frontal cortex into the version you 're going to have as an adult in that critical moment  
 but pushing back even further even further back to childhood and fetal life and all the different versions that that could come in now 
 obviously that 's the time that your brain
  is being constructed and that 's important  but in addition experience during those times produce what are called epigenetic changes  
 permanent in some cases  permanently activating certain genes turning off others  and as an example of this if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot of stress hormones through
  epigenetics is going to produce your amygdala in adulthood as a more excitable form and you 're going to have elevated stress hormone levels  
 but pushing even further back back to when you were just a fetus back to when all you were was a collection of genes  
 now genes are really important to all of this but critically genes don 't determine anything  because genes work differently in different environments 
 key example here there 's a variant of a gene called
  and if you have that variant you are far more likely to commit antisocial violence
 if and only if you were abused as a child 
 genes and environment interact  and what 's happening in that one second before you pull that trigger reflects your lifetime of those
  remarkably enough we 've got to push even further back now  back centuries what were your ancestors up to 
 and if for example  they were nomadic pastoralists they were pastoralists people living in deserts or grasslands with their herds of camels cows goats 
  odds are they would have invented what 's called a culture of honor filled with warrior classes retributive violence clan vendettas  and amazingly centuries later
 that would still be influencing the values with which you were raised  
 but we 've got to push even further back back millions of years because if we 're talking about genes implicitly we 're now talking about the evolution of genes 
 and what you see is for example  patterns across different primate species some of them have evolved for extremely low levels of aggression others have evolved in the
  opposite direction and floating there in between by every measure are humans  once again this confused barely defined species that has all these potentials to go one way or the other  
 so what has this gotten us to 
 basically what we 're seeing here is if you want to understand a behavior whether it 's an appalling one a wondrous one or confusedly in between if you want to understand
  that you 've got take into account what happened a second before to a million years before everything in between 
 so what can we conclude at this point  officially it 's complicated  wow that 's really helpful it 's complicated  and you 'd better be real careful real cautious before you conclude you know what
 causes a behavior
 especially if it 's a behavior you 're judging harshly 
 now to me the single most important point about all of this is one having to do with change every bit of biology i have mentioned here can change in different circumstances 
 for example  ecosystems change  thousands of years ago  the sahara was a lush grassland
  the most terrifying people in europe were the swedes rampaging all over the place this is what the swedish military does now they haven 't had a war in two hundred years 
 most importantly  brains change neurons grow new processes circuits disconnect  everything in the brain changes and
 out of this come extraordinary examples of human change  first one this is a man named
  john newton a british theologian who played a central role in the abolition of slavery from the british empire in the early 1800s 
 and amazingly this man spent decades as a younger man as the captain of a slave ship  and then as an investor in slavery growing rich
  and then
 something changed something changed in him something that newton himself celebrated in the thing that he 's most famous for a hymn that he wrote 
 amazing grace 
 this is a man named zenji abe on the morning of december six one thousand nine hundred and forty one about to lead a squadron of japanese bombers to attack pearl harbor  
 and this is the same man fifty years later to the day hugging a man
  survived the attack on the ground  and as an old man
 came to a collection of pearl harbor survivors at a ceremony there and in halting english apologized for what he had done as a young man 
 now it doesn 't always require decades sometimes  extraordinary change could happen in just hours
  powers that be had negotiated a brief truce so that soldiers could go out collect bodies from no man 's land in between the trench lines and soon british and german soldiers were doing that  
 and then helping each other carry bodies  and then helping each other dig graves in the frozen ground  and then praying
  and then having christmas together and exchanging gifts and by the next day they were playing soccer together and exchanging addresses so they could meet after the war that truce 
 kept going until the officers had to arrive and said we will shoot you unless you go back to trying to kill each other and all it took here was hours for these men 
  to develop a completely new category of us all of us in the trenches here on both sides dying for no damn reason  and who is a
  them those faceless powers behind the lines who were using them as pawns 
 and sometimes change can occur in seconds 
 probably the most horrifying event in the vietnam war was the my lai massacre 
 a brigade of american soldiers went into an undefended village full of civilians and killed between three hundred and fifty and five hundred of them
  and children  
 mutilated bodies  it was appalling it was appalling because it occurred 
 because the government denied it because the us government eventually did nothing more than a slap on the wrist 
 and appalling because it almost certainly was not a singular event 
 this man  hugh thompson this is the man who stopped the my lai massacre  he was piloting a helicopter gunship
  landed there got out and saw american soldiers shooting babies shooting old women figured out what was going on and he then took his helicopter 
 and did something that undid his lifetime of conditioning as to who is an us and who is a them he landed his helicopter in between some surviving villagers and american soldiers and he trained his machine guns on his fellow
  americans and said if you don 't stop the killing i will mow you down 
 now these people are no more special than any of us same neurons same 
  same biology what we 're left with here is this inevitable cliche those who don 't study history are destined to
  what we have here is the opposite of it 
 those who don 't study the history of extraordinary human change those who don 't study the biology of what can transform us from our worst to our best behaviors 
  those who don 't do this are destined not to be able to repeat these incandescent magnificent moments 
  give you a new mental model about something those are some of my favorite ted talks and we just got one  
 robert thank you so much for that good luck with the with the book that was amazing and we 're going to try and get you to come here in person one year  thank you so much
