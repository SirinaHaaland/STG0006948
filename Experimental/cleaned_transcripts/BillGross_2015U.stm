  i 'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me
 about what makes companies succeed the most what factors actually matter the most for startup success  i
 i believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place 
 if you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible you get them to achieve unbelievable things  
 but if the startup organization is so great why do so many fail 
 that 's what i wanted to find out i wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success and i wanted to try to be systematic about it
  avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions i have from so many companies i 've seen over the years 
 i wanted to know this because i 've been starting businesses since i was twelve years old when i sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school 
 to high school  when i made solar energy devices to college when i made loudspeakers and when i graduated from college i started software companies  and twenty years ago  i started
  last twenty years we started more than one hundred companies many successes  and many big failures  we learned a lot from those failures  
 so i tried to look across what factors
 accounted the most for company success and failure so i looked at these five first the idea  i used to think that the idea was everything
 i named my company idealab for how much i worship the aha moment when you first come up with the idea  but then over time
  i came to think that maybe the team the execution adaptability that mattered even more than the idea  i never thought i 'd be quoting boxer mike tyson on the ted stage
  but he once said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face 
 laughter and i think that 's so true about business as well  so much about a team 's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the
  the customer is the true reality  and that 's why i came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing 
 then i started looking at the business model  does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues that started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success 
 then i looked at the funding sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding  maybe that 's the most important thing  and then of course the timing 
 is the idea way too early and the world 's not ready for it is it early as in you 're in advance and you have to educate the world is it just right
 or is it too late and there 's already too many competitors  so i tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies  and i looked across all one hundred idealab companies  and one hundred non idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it 
 so first on these idealab companies the top five companies
 citysearch
  bottom z com insider pages mylife desktop factory peoplelink we all had high hopes for  but didn 't succeed 
 so i tried to rank across all of those attributes how i felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions  and then for non idealab companies i looked at wild successes  like airbnb and instagram and uber and youtube and linkedin 
 and some failures
  bottom companies had intense funding they even had business models in some cases but they didn 't succeed i tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies  and the results really surprised me 
 the number one thing was timing timing accounted for forty two percent
 of the difference between success and failure team
  execution came in second  and the idea the differentiability of the idea the uniqueness of the idea that actually came in third 
 now this isn 't absolutely definitive it 's not to say that the idea isn 't important  
 but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn 't the most important thing sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed  
 the last two business model and funding made sense to me actually i think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are
 what you 're creating 
 and funding  i think as well  if you 're underfunded at first but you 're gaining traction especially in today 's age it 's very very easy to get intense funding  
 so now let me give you some specific examples about each of these 
 so take a wild success like airbnb that everybody knows about well that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought no one 's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger of course people proved
  but one of the reasons it succeeded aside from a good business model a good idea 
 great execution is the timing that company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money  and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger  
 same thing with uber uber came out incredible company incredible business model great execution too but the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system drivers were looking for extra money it was very very important 
 some of our early
  citysearch came out when people needed web pages  goto com 
 which we announced actually at ted in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight was when companies were looking for cost effective ways to get traffic we thought the idea was so great but actually the timing was probably maybe more important  
 and then some of our failures  we started a company called z com it was an online entertainment company we were so excited about it we raised enough money we had a great business model
  even signed incredibly great hollywood talent to join the company  but broadband penetration was too low in
 it was too hard to watch video content online you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff  and the company eventually went out of business in two thousand and three just two years later when the codec problem was solved by adobe flash
 and when broadband penetration crossed fifty percent in america  youtube was perfectly timed  great idea  but unbelievable timing in fact youtube didn 't even have a business model when it first started it wasn 't even
 that that would work out but that was beautifully beautifully timed  
 so what i would say in summary is execution definitely matters a lot the idea matters a lot but timing might matter even more and the best way to really assess timing 
  is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them and to be really really honest about it not be in denial
  about any results that you see because if you have something you love you want to push it forward but you have to be very very honest about that factor on timing 
 as i said earlier  i think startups can change the world and make the world a better place  
 i hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio  and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn 't have happened otherwise thank you very much
