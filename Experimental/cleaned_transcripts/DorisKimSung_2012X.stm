  basically had to roll down the window it was usually too hot too stuffy or just too smelly  
 and my father would not let us use the air conditioner he said that it would overheat the engine  and you might remember some of
  you how the cars were back then and it was a common problem of overheating  but it was also the signal that capped the use or overuse of
 devices 
 things have changed now we have cars that we take across country we blast the air conditioning the entire way  and we never experience overheating  so there 's no more signal for us to tell us to stop great right
 well we have similar problems in buildings 
 in the past before air conditioning we had thick walls 
 the thick walls are great for insulation it keeps the interior very cool during the summertime  and warm during the wintertime  and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of of temperature transfer between the interior and
  with the advent of plate glass rolled steel and mass production  we were able to make floor to ceiling windows and unobstructed views  and with that came the 
 irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar heated spaces  
  they require a huge amount of energy they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere and for some of you may
 understand the heat island effect in cities where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas  
 but we also have problems that when we lose power we can 't open a window here  
 and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system
  can start up again
  even worse with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net zero energy state
 we can 't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient we need to look for something else and we 've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut so what do we do here how do 
  we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we 've dug  
  at biology and many of you probably don 't know i was a biology major before i went into architecture 
 the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body  
 and it 's a fantastic thing that 's the first line of defense for the body  
 it has pores it has sweat glands it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently and so what i propose is that our building skins
 should be more similar to
 to human skin  
 and by doing so can be much more dynamic responsive and and differentiated depending on where it is  
 and this gets me back to my research what i proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that i presently or currently
  work with smart materials and a smart 
 first of all i guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy  and that 's a very big deal for architecture what it
 is it 's a lamination of two different metals together you can see that here by the different reflection on this side  and because it has two different coefficients of expansion when heated  one side will expand faster than the other and
  result in a curling action 
 so in early prototypes i built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system  
 and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen
 when also heated  and currently
  have this installation at the materials & applications gallery in silver lake close by and it 's there until august if you want to see it it 's called bloom and the surface is made completely out of 
 and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things one 
 device so that when the sun hits the surface it constricts the amount of sun passing through and in other areas  it 's a ventilating system so that hot trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary
 you can see here in this time lapse video that the sun as it moves across the surface as well as the shade each of the tiles moves individually 
  keep in mind with the digital technology that we have today this thing was made out of about fourteen thousand pieces and there 's no two pieces alike at all  every single one is different 
  very specific to its location to the angle of the sun and also how the thing actually curls so this kind of
 proof of concept project has a lot of implications
 to actual future application in architecture  and in this case here you see a house that 's for a developer in china
  and it 's actually a four story glass box it 's still with that glass box because we still want that that visual access  but now it 's sheathed with this 
 layer it 's a screen that goes around it and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface 
 in addition to that 
 it can also screen areas for privacy so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day  and what it basically implies is that in houses now
 need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building 
 i 'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market and so here you see a pretty typical
  double glazed window panel  and in that panel between those two pieces of glass that
 i 'm trying to work on making a thermo bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and
 heats that interior cavity that thermo bimetal will begin to curl  and what actually will happen then is it 'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building  and totally if necessary
  and so you can imagine even in this application that in a high rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to thirty forty floors the entire surface could 
  be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface
  it 's actually smaller pieces of thermometal and it 's actually going to we 're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes 
 this last project is also of components 
 the influence and if you have noticed one of my spheres of influence is biology is from a grasshopper and grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system they breathe through
 holes in their sides called spiracles and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down and so in this project
 trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building  
 and so you see here some early studies of blocks where those holes are actually
 coming through and this is before the thermo bimetal is applied  
 and this is after the bimetal is applied  sorry it 's a little hard to see but on the surfaces you can see these red arrows on the left
 it 's when it 's cold and the
  is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks  and on the right the thermo bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through so
 those are two different components that i 'm working on and again  it 's a completely different thing because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows
