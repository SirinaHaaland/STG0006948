  ever experienced a moment in your life
 that was so painful and confusing
 that all you wanted to do was learn as much as you could to make sense of it all
 when i was thirteen a close family friend who was like an uncle to me
 passed away from pancreatic cancer
 when the disease hit so close to home i knew i needed to learn more so i went online to find answers
 using the internet i found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer and what i had found shocked me
 over eighty five percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late when someone has less than a two
  percent chance of survival
 why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer
 the reason today 's current modern medicine is a sixty year old technique
 that 's older than my dad laughter
 but also it 's extremely expensive costing eight hundred dollars per test and
 it 's grossly inaccurate missing thirty percent of all pancreatic cancers
 your doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer in order to give you this test
 learning this i knew there had to be a better way
 so i set up a scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer the sensor would have to be
  inexpensive rapid simple sensitive selective and minimally invasive
 now there 's a reason why this test hasn 't been updated in over six decades
 and that 's because when we 're looking for pancreatic cancer we 're looking at your bloodstream which is already
  all these tons and tons of protein and you 're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein just this one protein
 that 's next to impossible
 however undeterred due to my teenage optimism applause
 i went online to a teenager 's two best friends google and wikipedia
 i got everything for my homework from those two sources
  and what i had found was an article that listed a database of over eight thousand different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer
 so i decided to go and make it my new mission to go through all these proteins and see which ones could serve as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer
 and to make it a bit simpler for myself i decided to map out a scientific criteria and here
  first the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages but also only in cancer
 and so i 'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task and finally on the four thousand th try when i 'm close to losing my sanity i find the protein
 and the name of the protein i 'd located was called mesothelin and it 's just your ordinary run of the mill
  type protein unless of course you have pancreatic ovarian or lung cancer
 in which case it 's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream
 but also the key is that it 's found in the earliest stages of the disease when someone has close to one hundred percent chance of survival
 so now that i 'd found a reliable protein i could detect i then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein and thus pancreatic cancer
  now my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place possibly the most unlikely place for innovation
 my high school biology class the absolute stifler of innovation laughter applause
 and i had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes and that 's just a long thin pipe of carbon that 's an atom thick and one fifty thousandth the diameter
  of your hair and despite their extremely small sizes they have these incredible properties they 're kind of like the superheroes of material science
 and while i was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class we were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules called antibodies
 and these are pretty cool because they only react with one specific protein but they 're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes
 and
  so then i was sitting in class and suddenly it hit me
 i could combine what i was reading about carbon nanotubes with what i was supposed to be thinking about antibodies
 essentially i could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein
 but also due to the properties of these nanotubes
 it would change its electrical
  properties based on the amount of protein present
 however there 's a catch these networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy
 and since they 're so delicate they need to be supported so that 's why i chose to use paper
 making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies which i love
 you start with some water pour in some
  nanotubes add antibodies
 mix it up take some paper dip it dry it and you can detect cancer applause
 then suddenly a thought occurred
 that kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here
 i can 't really do cancer research
  on my kitchen countertop my mom wouldn 't really like that
 so instead i decided to go for a lab
 so i typed up a budget a materials list a timeline and a procedure and i emailed it to two hundred different professors at johns hopkins university and the national institutes of health essentially anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer
 and i sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in saying you 're a genius you
  going to save us all and laughter
 then reality took hold and over the course of a month i got one hundred and ninety nine rejections out of those two hundred emails
 one professor even went through my entire procedure painstakingly i 'm not really sure where he got all this time
 and he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake i could ever
  make clearly the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as i did
 however there was a silver lining one professor said maybe i might be able to help you kid
 so i went in that direction laughter
 as you can never say no to a kid and so then three months later i finally nailed down
  harsh deadline with this guy and i get into his lab i get all excited and then i sit down i start opening my mouth and talking and five seconds later he calls in another ph d
 ph d s just flock into this little room
 and they 're just firing these questions at me and by the end i kind of felt like i was in a clown car there were twenty ph d s plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space with them firing these rapid fire questions at
  me trying to sink my procedure how unlikely is that i mean pshhh laughter
 however subjecting myself to that interrogation i answered all of their questions and i guessed on quite a few but i got them right
 and i finally landed the lab space i needed but it was shortly afterwards that i discovered my once brilliant procedure had something like
  a million holes in it
 and over the course of seven months i painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes the result one small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run
 this makes it one hundred and sixty eight times faster
 over twenty six thousand times less expensive and over four hundred times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection
  one of the best parts of the sensor though is that it has close to one hundred percent accuracy and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages when someone has close to one hundred percent chance of survival
  and so in the next two to five years this sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal five point five percent to close to one hundred percent and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer
 but it wouldn 't stop there
 by switching out that antibody you can look at a different protein thus a different disease potentially any disease in the entire world
 so that ranges from heart disease to malaria hiv aids as well as other forms of cancer
 anything
 and so hopefully one day
 we can all have that one extra uncle that one mother that one brother sister we can have that one more family member to love
 and that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden that comes from pancreatic ovarian and lung cancer and potentially any disease
 that through the internet anything is possible theories
  can be shared and you don 't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued
 it 's a neutral space where what you look like age or gender it doesn 't matter it 's just your ideas that count
 for me it 's all about looking at the internet in an entirely new way to realize that there 's so much more to it than just posting duck face pictures of yourself online
  you could be changing the world so if a fifteen year old who didn 't even know what a pancreas was
 could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer
 just imagine what you could do thank you
