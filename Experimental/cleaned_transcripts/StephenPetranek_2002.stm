  in the last ten years are really extraordinary to the point where we know more about
  universe and how it works than
 many of you might imagine
 but there was something else that i 've noticed
 as those changes were taking place as people were starting to find out that hmm yeah there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy
 the science writers and editors i shouldn
 say science writers i should say people who write about science
 and editors would sit down over a couple of beers
 after a hard day of work and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works and
 they would inevitably end up in what i thought was a very bizarre place which is ways the world could end very suddenly
  at first it all seemed a little fantastical to me but after challenging a lot of these ideas
 i began to take a lot of them seriously and then september eleventh happened
 and i thought ah god i can 't go to the ted conference and talk about how the world is gonna end nobody wants to hear that not after this
 and that got me into a discussion with some other people other scientists about
 maybe some other subjects and one of the guys i talked to who was a neuroscientist said
 you know
  a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up and reminds me of
 michael 's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can 't have a solution if you don 't have a problem
 so we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow and lo and behold we found them
 which leads me to a videotape of a president bush
 press conference from a couple of weeks ago can we run that
  to defend our security
 and whatever it costs to defend our freedom
 we must pay it i agree with the president he wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year
 a two trillion dollar federal budget which will land us back into deficit spending real
  terrorists aren 't the only threat we face there are
 really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we 're in the same kind of denial about that we were about
 terrorism and what could 've happened on september eleventh
 i would propose therefore
 that if we took ten billion dollars from that
  that budget
 and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems i 'm going to talk to you about the vast majority could be solved
 and the rest we could deal with so i hope you find this both fascinating
 i 'm fascinated by this kind of stuff i gotta admit
 to me these are richard 's cockroaches
  but i also hope because i think the people in this room can literally change the world
 i hope you take some of this stuff away with you and when you have an opportunity to be influential
 that you try to get some heavy duty money spent on some of these ideas so let 's start
  number ten we lose the will to survive
 we live in an incredible age of modern medicine we are all much healthier than we were twenty years ago
 people around the world are getting better medicine
 but mentally we 're falling apart
 the world health organization now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed
  and the world health organization also says that depression is the biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced
 soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to
 allow us to think of one hundred as a normal life
  a female child born tomorrow on average median will live to age eighty three our life
 longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes
 now the problem with all of this getting older is that people over sixty five are the most likely people to commit suicide
 so what are the solutions we don 't really have mental health insurance in this
  like ninety eight percent of all people with depression and i mean really severe depression i have a friend with stunningly severe depression
 this is a curable disease with present medicine and present technology but it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills pills alone don 't do it
 especially in clinically depressed people
 you ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist
 or a psychologist and put down your ten dollar co pay and get treated just like you do when you got a cut on your arm it 's ridiculous secondly
 drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs we know that most
 mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with and we know just an amazing amount more about
  the brain now than we did ten years ago
 we need a pump push from the federal government through nih and national science nsf
 and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs
 moving on number nine don 't laugh aliens invade earth ten years ago you couldn 't have found an astronomer well very few
  astronomers in the world who would 've told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we found three
 the count now 's up to eighty we 're finding about two or three a month
 all of the ones we 've found by the way are in this little teeny tiny corner where we live in the milky way
 there must be millions of planets in the milky way and as carl sagan
  insisted for many years and was laughed at for it there must be billions and billions in the universe
 in a few years nasa is gonna launch four or five telescopes out to jupiter where there 's less dust and start looking for earth like planets
 which we cannot see with present technology nor detect
 it 's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in
 the universe and probably fairly close to us is a fairly remote idea
 and the chance that some of it isn 't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea
 remember we 've only been an advanced civilization an industrial civilization if you would for two hundred years although every time i go to pompeii i 'm amazed that
 they had the equivalent of a mcdonald 's on every street corner too so i don 't know how much civilization really has progressed
  since ad seventy nine but there 's a great likelihood
 i really believe this and i don 't believe in aliens but and i don 't believe there are any aliens on the earth or anything like that but
 there 's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own
 now what will happen
 what if they come to you know suck up our oceans for the hydrogen and swat us away like flies
  the way we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it we can look at our own history the late physicist gerard o 'neill said
 advanced western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with
 even in those cases where every attempt was made
 to protect and guard the primitive civilization
 if the aliens come visiting
 we 're the primitive civilization so what are the solutions to this
 thank god you can all read it
 may seem ridiculous but we have a really lousy history
  of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them how much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan
 to negotiate with an advanced species
 secondly
 and you 're gonna hear more from me about this we have to become an outward looking space faring nation we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn 't last forever our sun doesn 't last forever if we want humanity to last forever
 we have to colonize the milky way
  way and that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point it 'll
 also help us a lot if we meet an advanced civilization along the way if we 're trying to be an advanced civilization number eight
 number eight the ecosystem collapses last july in science the journal science
 nineteen oceanographers published a very very unusual article it wasn 't really a research report it was a screed they said we 've been looking at the oceans for a long time now and we wanna tell you they 're not in trouble they 're near collapse
  many other ecosystems
 on earth are in real real danger we 're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of ten thousand
 we have lost twenty five percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last twenty years california is expected to lose twenty five percent of its species in the next forty years
 somewhere in the amazon forest
  the marginal tree you cut down that tree the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem there 's really a tree like that out there that 's really what it comes to
 and when that ecosystem collapses it could take a major ecosystem with it
 like our atmosphere so what do we do about this what are the solutions
 there is some modeling of ecosystems going on now the problem
 with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly that we don 't know they 're really in trouble until it 's almost too late
 we need to know earlier that they 're getting in trouble and we need to
 be able to pump possible solutions into models and with the kind of computing power we have now there is as i say some of this going on but it needs money national science foundation needs to say you know
 almost all the money that 's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government one way
 and they get to prioritize you know there are people at the national science foundation who get to say this is the most important thing this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about secondly we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around
 there 's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank
 or the grand banks off of newfoundland
 it 's a no take fishing zone they can 't fish there for a radius of two hundred miles
 and an amazing thing has happened almost all the fish have come back and they 're reproducing like crazy
 we 're going to have to start doing this around the globe we 're gonna have to have no take zones we 're gonna have to say no more logging in the amazon for twenty years let it recover
 before we start logging again
 number seven particle accelerator mishap
 you all remember ted kaczynski the unabomber one of the things he raved about
 was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world
 a lot of very sober minded physicists believe it or not have had exactly the same thought
 this spring there 's a collider at brookhaven on long island this spring it 's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes they
  expecting to create little tiny black holes they expect them to evaporate
 i hope they 're right
 other collider experiments there 's one that 's gonna take place next summer at cern have the possibility of creating something called strangelets which are kind of like antimatter whenever they hit other matter they destroy it
 and obliterate it
 most physicists say that the accelerators we have now are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets that we need to worry about and they 're probably right but all around the world in japan in canada
 there 's talk about this of reviving this in the united states we shut one down that was gonna be big but there 's talk of building very big accelerators
 what can we do about this what
  we 've got the fox watching the hen house here we need to
 we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics and what should be done in particle physics but
 we need some outside thinking and watchdogging of what 's going on with these experiments
 secondly we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth we have
 an electromagnetic field around the earth and it 's constantly
  bombarded by high energy particles like protons and we don 't in my opinion we don 't spend enough time
 looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what 's safe to do on earth
 number six biotech disaster it 's one of my favorite ones because we 've done several stories on bt corn
  corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer you may of heard of it heard it called starling
 especially when all those taco shells were taken 
  out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago this stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the united states and it got into the human food supply and
 somebody should 've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily but the thing that 's alarming is a couple of months ago in mexico
 where bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal
 they found bt corn genes in wild corn plants now corn originated we think in mexico 
 this is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn
 this brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently that superweeds and superpests
 could spread around the world from biotechnology that literally could destroy the world 's food supply in very short order
 so what do we do about that
 we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants
 it 's that simple this is an amazingly unregulated field when the starling disaster happened there was a battle between the epa and the
  over who really had authority and over what parts of this and they didn 't get it straightened out for months that 's kind of crazy
 number five one of my favorites reversal of the earth 's magnetic field
 believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years and has happened many times in our history north pole goes to the south south pole goes to the north and vice versa
 but what happens as
  occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth over the period of about one hundred years and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that
  what can we do about this
  what can we do about this
  in the united states
  what can we do about this
  fairly close to us
