  from was to still  and i am illustrating still
  still doing this or that i don 't answer because i 'm not doing things still i 'm doing it like i always did 
 i still have
 or did i use the word
  which is
 called
 to do i have my plans  i have my clients i am doing my work like i always did
 so this takes care
  i want to show you my work so you know what i am doing and why i am here  this was 
 all of these things were made during the last
  doing more or less what you see here this is castleton china this was an exhibition
 at the museum of modern art 
 this is now for sale at the metropolitan museum this is still at the metropolitan museum now for sale
  this is a portrait of my daughter and myself these
 were just some of the things
 i call myself a maker of things i don 't call myself an industrial designer
 because i 'm other things industrial designers
 want to make novel things  novelty is a concept
  industrial design magazine i believe is called 
 innovation innovation is not part of the aim of my work 
 well  
  make things more beautiful more elegant more comfortable
 than just the craftsmen do i have so much to say i have to think what i am going to say  
 well to describe our profession otherwise we are actually
 concerned with the playful search for beauty that means the playful search for
  beauty was called the first activity of man sarah
 smith  who was a mathematics professor at mit wrote the playful search for beauty
 was man 's first
 activity
 that all useful qualities and all material
  qualities were developed from the
 playful search
 for beauty these are tiles the word playful is a necessary aspect of our work
 because actually one of our problems is that
  lovely things
 throughout all of life  
 and this for me is now seventy five years  so how can you without drying up 
 make things with the same pleasure as a gift to others
  for so long the playful is therefore an important part of our
 quality as designer 
 let me tell you some
 about my life as i said  i started to do these things
  exhibition in the united states was at the sesquicentennial exhibition in
  took me
 through many countries and showed me a great part of the world  
 this is not that they took me the work didn 't take me
 i
 made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world
  i was incredibly curious to see the world  and i made all these things  
 which then finally did take me to see many countries
 and many cultures  i started
 as an apprentice
  and this taught me what the
 guild system was
 in middle ages the guild system that means when i was an apprentice i had to
 apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master
  there was a
 traditional
 hierarchy of master journeyman and learned worker
  as an apprentice was very primitive that means i had to actually learn
 every aspect of making
 pottery pottery by hand we mashed the clay with our feet
 when it came from the
  hillside  after that it had to be kneaded it had to then go in kind of a mangle  and then finally
 it was prepared for the
 for the
 throwing  and there i really worked as an apprentice 
  the time and finally i had received a document that i had
 accomplished my apprenticeship successfully that i had behaved morally
  i also got at the time a workbook which explained my
  and i still have that workbook first i set up a shop in my own garden  and made pottery which i sold
 on the marketplace in budapest  and there i was sitting  and
 my 
 i didn 't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today but my boyfriend and
  i sat at the market and sold the pots my mother thought that this was not very proper  so she sat with us
 to
 add propriety to this activity 
 however after a while there was a new factory being built in budapest a pottery
  factory a large one  and i visited it with several ladies and asked all sorts of questions of the director then
 the director asked me why do you ask all these questions i said i also have a pottery 
 so he asked me  could he please visit me and then
 finally he did and explained to me that what i did
  now in my shop was an anachronism that the industrial revolution had broken out and that i rather should join
 the factory there he made an art department for me
 where i worked for several months  however  everybody in the factory spent his time
  at the art department the director there said there were several women
 casting and producing my designs now in molds  and this was sold also to
 everybody concerned himself much more with the art department that means with my work than making toilets  so finally 
 they got a letter from the center from the bank who owned the factory saying make
  and that was my end  so this gave me the possibility because now i was a journeyman and journeymen also take their satchel
 and go
 to see the world  so as a journeyman i put an ad into the paper
 that i had studied that i was a down to earth potter 's journeyman and i was looking for a job as
  got several answers and
 i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically i thought halfway to america  
 and that was in hamburg 
 then i first took this job in hamburg  at an
 art pottery where everything was done
  and so i worked in a shop
 where there were several
 potters  and the first day i was coming to take
 my place at the
 turntable there were three or four turntables and one of
  who smelled very bad so i doused him in
 cologne every day  which he thought was very nice  and therefore
 he brought bread and butter
 every day which i had to eat out of courtesy the first day i came to work in this shop there was on my
  my wheel a surprise for me my colleagues had thoughtfully put
 on the
 wheel where i was supposed to work a very nicely modeled
  they were very i finally
 was now accepted  and worked there for some six months
 this was my first job 
  go on like this you will be here till midnight
  i have to tell you that within five minutes i will talk very fast and
 actually my work took me to many countries because i
 used my work to fill my curiosity  and
  i was finally there although i had nothing to do i was a foreign expert  i became art director of the china and glass industry  
 and eventually
  purges at the beginning of stalin 's purges i didn 't know that
 hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested so i was arrested
 quite early in stalin 's purges  and spent sixteen months
 in
 a russian prison
 that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin 's life  this was a very dangerous
 accusation  and if
 this is the end of my five minutes i want to tell you that i actually
  i survived and i 'm here  and since this is the end of the five minutes i will moderator tell me when your last trip to russia was
 invited me they found out that i had worked in ' thirty three at this factory  and they came to my
 studio in rockland county and brought the fifteen of their
 artists to visit me here  and they invited myself to come to the russian factory last summer
  july to make some dishes  
 design some dishes  and since i don 't like to travel alone  they also invited
 my
 daughter son in law and granddaughter  so we had a lovely trip to see
 russia today which is not a very pleasant and happy view
  i am now  if this is the end
