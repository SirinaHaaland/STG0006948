  we talk about corruption there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind
 there 's the former soviet megalomaniacs saparmurat niyazov he was one of them
 until his death in two thousand and six he was the all powerful leader of turkmenistan a central asian
  country rich in natural gas
 now he really loved to issue presidential decrees and one renamed the months of the year including after himself and his mother
 he spent millions of dollars creating a bizarre personality cult
 and his crowning glory was the building of a forty
 foot high gold plated statue of himself which stood proudly in the capital 's central square and rotated to follow the sun
 he was a slightly unusual guy
 and then there 's that cliche the african dictator or minister or official there 's teodorin obiang
 so his daddy is president for life of equatorial guinea a west african nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the
  ninety s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record
 the vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that 's on a par with that of portugal
 so obiang junior well he buys himself a dollar thirty million mansion in malibu california
 i 've been up to its front gates i can tell you it 's a magnificent spread
 he bought an euro eighteen million art collection that used to belong to fashion designer yves saint laurent
 a stack of fabulous sports cars some costing a million dollars apiece oh and a gulfstream jet too
 now get this until recently he was earning an official monthly salary of less than seven thousand dollars
  there 's dan etete well he was the former oil minister of nigeria under president abacha and it just so happens he 's a convicted money launderer too
 we 've spent a great deal of time investigating a dollar one billion that 's right a dollar one billion oil deal that he was involved with
 and what we found
 was pretty shocking but more about that later
 so
 it 's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries
 that we personally may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected
 by what might be going on
 but does it just happen over there
 well at twenty two i was very lucky my first job
 out of university was investigating the illegal trade in african ivory and that 's how my relationship with corruption really began
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three with two friends who were colleagues simon taylor and patrick alley
 we set up an organization called global witness our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in cambodia
 so a few years later and it 's now one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and i 'm in angola undercover investigating blood diamonds
 perhaps you saw the film the hollywood film blood diamond the one with leonardo dicaprio well some of that sprang from from our work
 luanda it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the
  and a tiny very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to brazil and portugal and it was a slightly crazy place
 so i 'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed but it wasn 't about blood diamonds
 because i 'd been speaking to lots of people there who well they talked about a different problem that of a massive web of corruption on a
  global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing and for what was then a very small organization of just a few people
 trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge
 and in the years that i 've been and we 've all been campaigning and investigating i 've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global massive scale possible well it it isn 't just greed or the misuse
  of power or that nebulous phrase weak governance i mean yes it 's all of those
 but corruption it 's made possible by the actions of global facilitators
 so let 's go back to some of those people i talked about earlier now they 're all people we 've investigated and they 're all people who couldn 't do what they do alone
 take obiang junior well he didn 't end up with high end art and luxury houses without
  help he did business with global banks a bank in paris held accounts of companies controlled by him one of which was used to buy the art
 and american banks well they funneled seventy three million dollars into the states some of which was used to buy that california mansion
 and he didn 't do all
  this in his own name either he used shell companies he used one to buy the property and another which was in somebody else 's name
 to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place
 and then there 's dan etete well
 when he was oil minister he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars
 to a company that guess what
 yeah he was the hidden owner of
 now it was then much later traded on
 with the kind assistance of the nigerian government now i have to be careful what i say here
 to subsidiaries of shell and the italian eni two of the biggest oil companies around
 so the reality is is that the engine of corruption well it exists far beyond the shores of countries like equatorial guinea or nigeria or turkmenistan
 this engine well it 's driven by our international banking system
  problem of anonymous shell companies and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil gas and mining operations
 and most of all by the failure of our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff
 now let 's take the banks first well it 's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept
  dirty money
 but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too
 for example in sarawak malaysia
 now this region it has just five percent of its forests left intact five percent
 so how did that happen well because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars
  from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years
 so we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite
 and the resulting footage well it made some people very angry and you can see that on youtube but it proved what we had long suspected because it showed how
  the state 's chief minister despite his later denials used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family
 and hsbc well we know that hsbc bankrolled the region 's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in sarawak and elsewhere
 the bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process but it earned around one hundred and thirty million dollars
 now shortly after our expose very shortly after our expose earlier this year the bank announced a policy review on this and is this progress
 maybe but we 're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case
 and then there 's the problem of anonymous shell companies well we 've all
  heard about what they are i think and we all know they 're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society
 also known as taxes
 but what doesn 't usually come to light is how
 shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money transformational sums of money from poor countries
 in virtually every case of corruption that we 've investigated shell companies have appeared
 and sometimes it 's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal
 a recent study by the world bank looked at two hundred cases of corruption
 it found that over seventy percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies totaling almost fifty six billion dollars
 now many of these companies were in america or the united kingdom its
  territories and crown dependencies and so it 's not just an offshore problem it 's an on shore one too
 you see shell companies they 're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens
 one striking recent case that we 've investigated is how the government in the democratic republic of congo sold off a series of valuable state owned mining
  assets to shell companies in the british virgin islands
 so we spoke to sources in country trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal
 and we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies
 listed in london
  now the africa progress panel led by kofi annan they 've calculated that congo may have lost
 more than one point three billion dollars from these deals
  that 's almost twice the country 's annual health and education budget combined
 and will the people of congo will they ever get their money back well the answer to that question and who was really involved and
  really happened well that 's going to probably remain locked away
 in the secretive company registries of the british virgin islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it
 and how about the oil gas and mining companies okay maybe it 's a bit of a cliche to talk about them corruption in that sector no surprise there 's corruption everywhere so why focus on that sector
 well because there 's a lot at stake
  stake in two thousand and eleven natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost nineteen to one in africa asia and latin america
 nineteen to one
 now that 's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups many of which haven 't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away
  now let 's go back to the oil and mining companies and let 's go back to dan etete and that dollar one billion deal and now forgive me i 'm going to read
 the next bit because it 's a very live issue and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right
 now on the surface the deal appeared straightforward subsidiaries of shell and eni paid the nigerian government for the block
 the nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount to the very dollar to
 an account earmarked for a shell company
 whose hidden owner was etete now that 's not bad going for a convicted money launderer
 and here 's the thing after many months of digging around and and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents we found evidence that in fact shell
  and eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company
 and frankly it 's hard to believe they didn 't know who they were really dealing with there
 now
 it just shouldn 't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went i mean these are state assets they 're supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country
 but in some countries
 citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so
 and finally
 well there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable
 it 's just how some business is done it 's too complex and difficult to change so in effect what we just accept it
 but as a campaigner
  and investigator i have a different view because i 've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum
 in the oil and mining sector for example there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine when global witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent well some people laughed at the
  extreme naivete of that small idea
 but literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency
 and now it 's fast becoming the norm and the law two thirds of the value of the world 's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws two thirds so this is change happening
  progress but
 but we 're not there yet by far because it really isn 't about corruption somewhere over there is it
 in a globalized world corruption is a truly globalized business and one that needs global solutions supported and pushed by us all as global citizens
 right here
