  one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world  and i do that quite regularly  
 and when i meet the mothers in so many of these remote places  i 'm really struck by the things that we have in common  they want what we want
  our children and that is for their children to grow up successful to be healthy and to have a successful life  
 but i also see lots of poverty  
 and it 's quite jarring  both in the scale and the scope of it 
 my first trip in india i was in a person 's home where they had dirt floors  no running water  no electricity and that 's really what i see all over the world
  so in short  i 'm startled by all the things that they don 't have 
 but i am surprised by one thing that they do have
 coca cola coke is everywhere in fact when i travel to the developing world coke feels ubiquitous  and so when i come back from these
  and i 'm thinking about development  and i 'm flying home and i 'm thinking we 're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations 
 you know coke 's success kind of stops and makes you wonder how is it that they can get coke to these far flung places  
 if they can do that why can 't governments and and ngos do the same thing  and i 'm not the first person to ask this question  
 but i think as a community  we still have a lot to learn 
 it 's staggering if you think about
  one point five billion servings every single day that 's like every man woman and child on the planet having a serving of coke every week  
 so why does this matter  
 well if we 're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we 're set as a world 
 we need to learn from the innovators 
 and those innovators come
  from every single sector  
 i feel that if we can understand what makes something like coca cola ubiquitous 
 we can apply those lessons then for the public good 
 coke 's success is relevant because if we can analyze it learn from it then we can save lives 
  so that 's why i took a bit of time to study coke 
 and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca cola 
 they take real time data and immediately feed it back into the product  they tap into local entrepreneurial talent 
 and they do incredible marketing  
 so let 's start with the data  
 now coke has a very clear bottom line they report
 set of shareholders they have to turn a profit so they take the data and they use it to measure progress they have this very continuous feedback loop they learn something they put it back 
 into the product they put it back into the market  they have a whole team called knowledge and insight it 's a lot like other consumer companies  
  start to drop then the person can identify the problem and address the issue 
 let 's contrast that for a minute to development 
 in development the evaluation comes at the very end
 of the project  i 've sat in a lot of those meetings  and by then it is way too late to use the data 
 i had somebody from an ngo once describe
  it to me as bowling in the dark they said you roll the ball you hear some pins go down  it 's dark you can 't see which one goes down until the lights come on and then you an see your impact 
  data turns on the lights  
 so what 's the second thing that coke 's good at they 're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent coke 's been in africa since
 and twenty eight but most of the time they couldn 't reach the distant markets because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world which was a large truck rolling down the street and in africa the remote places it 's hard to find a good road  
 but coke noticed something they noticed that local people were taking the product  buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these
  and so they took a bit of time to learn about that and they decided in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs  giving them small loans they set them up as what they called 
  centers 
 and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product
 there are now some three thousand of these centers employing about fifteen thousand people in africa 
 in tanzania and uganda
  represent ninety percent
 of coke 's sales
 let 's look at the development side what is it that governments and and ngos can learn from coke
 governments and and ngos need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well because the locals know how to reach the very hard to serve places their neighbors and they know what motivates them to make change
  i think a great example of this is ethiopia 's new health extension program 
 the government noticed in ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic they were over a day 's travel away from a health clinic so if you 're in an emergency situation or if you 're a mom about to deliver a baby forget it to get to the health care center 
 they decided
  that wasn 't good enough so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this and they adapted it for ethiopia  
 and in two thousand and three the government of ethiopia started this new system in their own country  they trained thirty five thousand health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people
 in just five years their ratio went from one worker for every thirty thousand people
  five hundred people 
 now think about how this can change people 's lives 
 health extension workers can help with so many things  whether it 's family planning prenatal care immunizations for the children or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on time delivery 
 that is having real impact in a country like ethiopia  and it 's why you see their child mortality
  numbers coming down twenty five percent from two thousand to two thousand and eight 
 in ethiopia there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program  
 so what 's the next step for ethiopia well they 're already starting talk about this they 're starting to talk about how do you have the health community workers generate their own
  how do you incent them based on the impact that they 're getting out in those remote villages 
 that 's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people 's potential 
 the third component of coke 's success is marketing 
 ultimately coke 's success depends on one crucial fact
 and that is that people want a
  now the reason these micro entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow so they rely on coca cola
 in terms of its marketing and what 's the secret to their marketing well 
 it 's aspirational it is associated that product with a kind of life
 that people want to live  so even though it 's a global company  they take a very local approach coke 's global campaign
  slogan is open happiness 
 but they localize it 
 and they don 't just guess what makes people happy they go to places like latin america and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life  
 and in south africa  they associate happiness with seriti or community respect now
  played itself out in the world cup campaign let 's listen to this song that coke created for it wavin ' flag by a somali hip hop artist
  it feels pretty good right
  they didn 't stop there they localized it into eighteen different languages  and it went number one on the pop chart in seventeen countries
 it reminds me of a song that i remember from my childhood i 'd like to teach the world to sing that also went number one on the pop charts  
 both songs have something in common  that same appeal of celebration
 and unity
  so how does health and development market  
 well  it 's based on avoidance not aspirations i 'm sure you 've heard some of these messages use a condom don 't get aids 
 wash you hands you might not get diarrhea 
 it doesn 't sound anything like wavin ' flag to me 
 and i think we make a fundamental mistake
 we make an assumption that we think that if people need something we don 't have to make them want that and i think that 's a mistake  
 and there 's some indications around the world that this is starting to change one example is sanitation  
 we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea
 and a lot of it is because of open defecation but there 's a solution you build a toilet 
 but what we 're finding around the world over and over again is if you build a toilet
 and you leave it there it doesn 't get used people reuse it for a slab for their home they sometimes store grain in it i 've even seen it used for a chicken coop 
 but what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea  well you work with the community you start 
  to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn 't be done in the village and they agree to that 
  take the toilet and you position it as a modern trendy convenience 
 one state in northern india has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship  and it works look at these headlines 
 i 'm not kidding  women are refusing
  it 's not just a funny headline it 's innovative it 's an innovative marketing campaign  
 but more importantly  it saves lives  
 take a look at this
 this is a room full of young men and my husband bill and
 can you guess what the young men
  waiting to be circumcised 
 can you you believe that 
 we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by sixty percent in men 
 and when we first heard this result inside the foundation i have to admit  bill and i were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying but who 's going to volunteer for this procedure but it turns out the men do 
 because they 're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it 
 and the men also believe it improves their sex life
  so if we can start to understand
 what people really want in health and development we can change communities
 and we can change whole nations well
 why is all of this so important so let 's talk about what happens when this all comes together when you tie the three
  and polio i think is one of the most powerful examples 
 we 've seen a ninety nine percent reduction in polio in twenty years  
 so if you look back to one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight there are about three hundred and fifty thousand cases of polio on the planet that year 
 in two thousand and nine we 're down to one thousand six hundred cases well how did that happen 
 let 's look at a country like india  they have over a billion people in this country  but they have
  doctors who report paralysis and clinicians a huge reporting system in chemists  they have two and a half million vaccinators  
 but let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you let me tell you the story of shriram an eighteen month boy in bihar a northern state in india 
 this year on august 8th he felt paralysis
  his parents took him to the doctor on august 14th and 15th they took a stool sample  and by the 25th of august it was confirmed he had type one polio 
 by august 30th a genetic test was done and we knew what strain of polio shriram had 
 now it could have come from one of two places it could have come from nepal just to the north across the border or from jharkhand a state just to the
  the genetic testing proved that in fact this strand came north because had it come from the south it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission so many more people would have been affected  
 so what 's the endgame well on september 4th there was a huge mop up campaign which is what you do in polio they went out and where shriram lives they vaccinated two million people 
 so in less than a month we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program  and i 'm happy to say only one
 other person in that area got polio  
 that 's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading  and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands they can save lives  
 now one of the challenges in polio still is marketing but it might not be what you think  
 it 's not the marketing on the ground it 's not telling the parents if you see paralysis take your child to the
  or get your child vaccinated 
 we have a problem with marketing in the donor community the g8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last twenty years  
 but we 're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren 't willing to fund polio any longer so by next summer we 're sighted to run out of money on polio 
  of the way there
 on this goal and we 're about to run short of money  
 and i think that if the marketing were more aspirational if we could focus as a community on how far we 've come
 and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease we could put polio fatigue
 and polio behind us and if we could do that we could stop vaccinating
  all of our countries for polio and it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet 
 and we are so close  and this victory is so possible  
 so if coke 's marketers came to me
 and asked me
 to define happiness  
 i 'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms to me
 that is deep happiness  
 and so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector then in the future we make together  that happiness can be
 just as ubiquitous as
