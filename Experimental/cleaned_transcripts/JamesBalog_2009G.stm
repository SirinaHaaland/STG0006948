  most of the time art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension  there is great confusion
 when the two look at each other art of course
  looks at the world through
 the psyche  the emotions the unconscious at times and of course the aesthetic science
 tends to look at the world through the rational  the quantitative things that can be measured and described but it gives art a terrific context of understanding 
 in the extreme ice survey we 're dedicated to bringing those two parts of
 human understanding together to merging the art and science
 to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity 's relationship with nature better 
 specifically  i as a person who 's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life 
 am firmly of the belief that photography  video film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape
 the way we think about nature and about ourselves
  in relationship to nature in this project we 're specifically interested of course in ice  
 i 'm fascinated by the beauty of it the mutability of it the malleability of it and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself these first images are from greenland 
 but ice has another meaning ice is the
 canary in the global coal mine
  it 's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action 
 climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less is it getting hotter or is it getting colder
  what do the computer models say about this that and the other thing 
 all of that strip
  in the world of the arctic and alpine environments where the ice is it 's real and it 's present  the changes are happening they 're very visible they 're photographable they 're measurable
 ninety five percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking  
 that 's outside antarctica  ninety five percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking and that 's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing  
 there is no significant scientific dispute about that
 's been observed  it 's measured  it 's bomb proof information and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that science is not arguing about that 
 in these images we see ice from enormous glaciers ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into chunks and chunk by chunk by chunk iceberg by iceberg  turning into global sea
  level rise  so having seen all of this in the course of a 30 year career  
 i was still a skeptic about climate change until about ten years ago because i thought
 the story of climate change was based on computer models i hadn 't realized it was based on concrete measurements
 of what the 
  ancient climates were as recorded in the ice sheets as recorded in deep ocean sediments as recorded in lake sediments  tree rings and a lot of other
 ways of measuring temperature when i realized that climate change was real and it was not based on computer models i decided that one day i would i would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically and that led me to this
  i was working on a national geographic assignment conventional single frame still photography and one crazy day i got the idea that i should
 after that assignment was finished i got the idea that i should shoot
 in time lapse photography that i should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every fifteen minutes or every hour or whatever
 and watch the progression of the landscape over time well within about three
  incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time lapse cameras into
  cameras and the next six months of my life were the hardest
 time in my career  trying to design  build and deploy out in the field these twenty five time lapse cameras 
 they are powered by the sun
  solar panels power them power goes into a battery  there is a custom made computer that tells the
  camera when to fire and these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers and they look in on the glacier from permanent  bedrock positions and they watch the evolution of the landscape 
 we just had a number of
 cameras out on the greenland ice sheet we actually drilled holes into the ice way deep down below the thawing level and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so actually there 's still a camera out there right now in any case
  the cameras shoot roughly every hour  some of them shoot every half hour every fifteen minutes every five minutes  here 's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made 
 i personally obsessed about every nut  bolt and washer in these crazy things i spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally 
  we 're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere 
 our time lapse units are in alaska  the rockies greenland and iceland  and we have repeat photography positions that is places we just visit on an annual basis in british columbia the alps and bolivia  
 it 's a big undertaking i stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team there 's a lot of people working on this right now we 've got thirty three cameras out this moment we
  just had thirty three cameras shoot about half an hour ago
 all across the northern hemisphere watching what 's happened 
 and we 've spent a lot of time in the field it 's been a fantastic amount of work we 've been out for two and a half years and we 've got about another two and a half years yet to go 
 that 's only half our job the other half of our job is to tell the story to the global
  scientists have collected this kind of information
 off and on over the years  but a lot of it stays within the science community  similarly 
 a lot of art projects stay in the art community and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like ted and like our relationship with the obama white house with the senate with john
  to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well  we 've done films we 've done books we have more coming we have a site on google earth
 that google earth was was generous enough to give us  
 and so forth because we feel very much the need to tell this story because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now 
 now one bit of science before we get into the visuals if everybody in the developed world
 understood this graph  and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads there would be no further societal argument about climate change because
 this is the story that counts everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion  
 key issues  this is a four hundred thousand year record  this exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time 
 several things are important number one temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync you can see that from the orange line and the blue line 
 nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to two hundred and eighty parts per million  that 's the natural cycle 
 goes up to two hundred and eighty and then drops for various reasons that aren 't important to discuss right here  but two
  is the peak right now if you look at the top right part of that graph  we 're at three hundred and eighty five parts per million  we are way way outside the normal natural variability 
 earth is having a fever  in the past hundred years the temperature of the earth has gone up
 one point three degrees fahrenheit 75 degrees
  it 's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere
 at the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year  it 's been a remorseless  steady increase we have to turn that around 
 that 's the crux  and someday i hope to emblazon that across times square in new york and a lot of other places but anyway 
 off to the world of ice we 're now at the columbia glacier in alaska this is a view of what 's called the calving face  this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months
 you see the glacier flowing in from the right 
 dropping off into the sea camera shooting every hour  if you look in the in the middle background you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo yo 
 that means that glacier 's floating and it 's unstable and you 're about to see the consequences of that floating to give you
 a little bit of a sense of scale  that calving face in this picture
 is about
  three hundred and twenty five feet tall that 's thirty two stories  this is not a little cliff  this is like a major office building in an urban center  
 the calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off  but in fact it goes down below sea level
 another couple thousand feet so there 's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if
 if the glacier 's grounded on bedrock and floating if it isn 't here
 's what columbia 's done this is in south central alaska  
 this was an aerial picture i did one day in june three years ago  this is an aerial picture we did this year  
 that 's the retreat
  the main stem the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right
 and
 it 's going very rapidly up that stem we 're going to be up there in just a few more weeks  and we expect that it 's probably retreated another half a mile but if i
 if i got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back i wouldn 't be the least bit surprised now it 's really hard to grasp the scale of
  these places because as the glaciers one of the things is that places like alaska and greenland are huge they 're not normal landscapes
 but as the glaciers are are retreating  they 're also deflating like air is being let out of a balloon 
 and so there are features on this landscape there 's a ridge right in the middle of the picture up above where that arrow comes in 
 that shows you that a little bit there 's a marker line called the trim line
 above our little red
  illustration there this is something no self respecting photographer would ever do you put some cheesy illustration on your shot right and
 yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points  but in any case the deflation of this glacier since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four has been
 higher than the eiffel tower higher than the empire state building a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it 's retreated and deflated gone back
  up valley 
 these changes in the alpine world are accelerating  
 it 's not static  particularly in the world of sea ice 
 the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago and the processes
 either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with  but in any case  there are big big changes happening as we speak
  here 's another time lapse shot of columbia  
 and you see where it ended in these various spring days june may  then october now we turn on our time lapse this camera was shooting every hour  
 geologic process in action here  and everybody says well don 't they advance in the winter time no it was retreating through the winter because it 's an unhealthy glacier finally catches up to itself it advances
 you can look at these pictures over and over again because there 's such a strange 
 bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don 't normally get to see come alive we 've been talking about seeing is believing and seeing the unseen at
 ted global that 's what you see with these cameras  the images make the
  huge crevasses open up these great ice islands break off
 and now watch this this has been the springtime this year a
 huge collapse that happened in about a month the loss of all that ice
  so that 's where we started three years ago way out on the left and that 's where we were a few months ago the last time we went into columbia 
 to give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat we did another cheesy illustration
 with british double decker buses if you line up two hundred and ninety five of those nose to tail  that 's about how far back that was
 on up to iceland  one of my favorite glaciers  the slheimajkull 
 and here if you watch you can see the terminus retreating you can see this river being formed  you can see it deflating
  without the photographic process you would never see this this is invisible  you can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this but the camera records it 
 so we wind time backwards now 
 we go back a couple years in time  that 's where it started
  that 's where it ended a few months ago
  and on up to greenland 
 the smaller the ice mass  the faster it responds to climate greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past
 century  but it really started galloping along about twenty years ago  and there 's been a tremendous
 increase in the temperature up there it 's a
 big place  that 's all ice all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick 
 just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle
  the one glacier up in greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the
  we have some cameras on the south
 edge of the ilulissat watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat here 's a two year record of what that looks like helicopter in front of the calving face for scale  
 quickly dwarfed the calving face is four and a half miles across and in this shot as we pull back you 're only seeing about a mile and a half so imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out the interior of greenland is to the right it 's
 flowing out to the atlantic ocean on the left
  many many many many times the size of this building are roaring out to sea  we just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago as you can see june 25th 
 monster calving events happened i 'll show you one of those in a second this glacier has doubled its flow speed
 in the past fifteen years it now goes at one hundred and twenty five feet a day  dumping all this ice into the ocean
  it tends to go in these pulses about every three days but on average one hundred and twenty five feet a day twice the rate it did twenty years ago  
 okay  we had a team
 out watching this glacier and we recorded the biggest calving event that 's ever been put on film  we had nine cameras going  this is what a couple of the cameras saw
  icebergs rolling over
  how big was that it 's hard to get it
 an illustration again gives you a feeling for scale a
 mile of retreat in seventy five minutes across the calving face in that particular event three miles wide  
 the block was three fifths of a mile deep and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the tower bridge in london about twenty bridges wide 
 or if you take an american reference
  to the u s capitol building and you pack three thousand capitol buildings into that block it would be equivalent to how large that block was
 seventy five minutes 
 now i 've
 come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world
 that we don 't have a problem of economics technology and public policy  we have a problem of perception the policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough
  issues  but we actually can deal with them i 'm certain that we can 
 but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet you 're an elite audience you get it 
 fortunately a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now  but we still need to bring a lot of people along with us  and that
  's where i think organizations like ted like the extreme ice survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along because i believe we have an opportunity 
  right now we are nearly on the edge of a crisis  but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and in fact
  of our century
 this is a terrific terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future  i hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done  thank you
