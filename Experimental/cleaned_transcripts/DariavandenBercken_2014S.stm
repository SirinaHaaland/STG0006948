  i flew over a crowd of thousands of people in brazil playing music by george  frideric handel
  i also drove along the streets of amsterdam again playing music by this same composer let 's take a look
  all this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons
 now you may ask why have i done these things  they 're not really typical for a musician 
 well i did it because i fell in love with the music and i wanted to share it with as many people as possible 
 it started a couple of years ago  i was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the internet a little when i
  found out that handel had written works for the keyboard  
 well i was surprised i did not know this so i downloaded the sheet music and started playing 
 and what happened next was that i entered this state of
 pure  unprejudiced amazement it was an experience of being totally in awe of the music
  and i had not felt that in a long time 
 it might be easier to relate to this when you hear it  the first piece that i played through
 started like this
  sounds very melancholic doesn 't it  and i turned the
  and what came next was this
  this sounds very energetic doesn 't it 
 so within a couple of minutes  and the piece isn 't even finished yet i experienced two very contrasting characters 
 beautiful melancholy and sheer energy  
 and i consider these two elements to be vital
  and the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively  
 i 've given a lot of children 's concerts for children of seven
 and eight years old  and whatever i play whether it 's bach  beethoven even stockhausen or some jazzy music  
 they are open to hear it really willing to listen and they are comfortable
 doing so
 and when classes come in with children who are just
 a few years older eleven twelve  
 i felt that i sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that 
 the complexity of the music does become an issue  and
 actually the opinions of others
  they start to count 
 but the young ones they don 't question their own opinion 
 they are in this constant state of wonder  and i do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven year old children 
 even when growing up  
 and that is why i have played not only in the concert hall but also on the street online in the
 air to feel that state of wonder to truly listen 
 and to listen without prejudice  and i would like to invite you
 to do so now
