  i 'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects done in collaboration with danish artist soren pors we call ourselves pors and rao  and we live and work in india 
 i 'd like to begin with my very first object which i call the uncle phone and it was inspired by my uncle
  's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him almost like i were an extension of his body to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water a pack of cigarettes  
 and as i grew up it became worse and worse and i started to think of it as a form of control but of course i could never say anything because
 the uncle is a respected figure in the indian family  and the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone
  the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him 
 and so as a response and as a gift to my uncle i made him the uncle phone 
 it 's so long that it requires two people to use it it 's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that 's designed for one person but
 the problem is that when i left home and went to college i started missing his commands 
 and so i made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as
  an email  
 so what he had to do was take a piece of paper roll it into the carriage  type his email or command and pull the paper out 
 this device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email  
 so here you can see we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital  
 so my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface and of course the object had to be very grand and have a sense
  of ritualism the way my uncle likes it the next work is a sound sensitive installation
 that we affectionately call the pygmies 
 and we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy sensitive and sweet creatures 
 so how it works is we have these panels which we have on the wall and behind them we have these little creatures which hide
  and as soon as it 's silent they sort of creep out and if it 's even more silent they stretch their necks out and at the slightest sound they hide back again  
 so we had these panels on three walls of a room  and we had over five hundred of these little pygmies hiding behind them so this is how it works this is a video prototype  
 so when it 's quiet it 's sort of coming out from behind the panels and they hear like humans do or real creatures do 
 so they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile and they don 't react to background sounds
 moment that they don 't react to 
 but they react to foreground sounds you 'll hear that in a second 
 so we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible  
 so each pygmy has
  mood swings personalities and so on  
 so this is a very early prototype of course it got much better after that 
 and we made them react to people but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them 
 this is a video installation called the missing person and we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility how would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility  
 so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us
  using a camera that could look at people in the room  track them and replace one person with the background rendering them invisible  so i 'm just going to show you a very early prototype 
 on the right side you can see my colleague soren who 's actually in the space and on the left side you 'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible
  he goes invisible  
 and you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing it 's a very early video  
 so we haven 't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that but that got refined pretty soon later  
 so how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space  and we had one monitor one on each wall  and as people walked into the room they would see themselves in the monitor except with one difference one person was constantly invisible
 almost like a sheet of paper like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun  
 and from the front this object appeared to be very strong and robust and from the side it almost seemed very weak 
 so people would walking into the room and they 'd almost ignore it thinking it was some crap laying around but as soon as they passed by it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion  and it would get exhausted and it would collapse every time
 laughter so this work is
 a caricature of an upside down man his head is so heavy full of heavy thoughts that it 's sort of fallen into his hat 
 and his body 's grown out of him almost like a plant  
 well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement and it 's kind of constrained
  by that circle because if that circle weren 't there and the floor was very even it would start to wander about in the space and there 's no
 wires so i 'll just show you an instance so when people enter the room it activates this object 
 and it very slowly over a few minutes sort of painfully goes up  and then it gains momentum and it looks like it 's almost about to fall 
 and this is an important moment because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and
  or save the subject but it doesn 't really need it because it again sort of manages to pull itself up  
 so this work was a real technical challenge for us and we worked very hard like most of our works over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics  
 and it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall  
 because if
 we made it in a way that it would topple over then it would damage itself and if it didn 't fall enough it wouldn 't instill that fatalism or that sense of wanting to go and help
  it  so i 'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario it 's much faster that 's my colleague he 's let it go now he 's getting nervous so he 's going to go catch it but he doesn 't need to  because it manages to lift itself up on its own
 so this is a work that we were very intrigued with working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of
 tiny different sizes of fiber optics which twinkle like the night sky and it 's at the scale of the night
  sky  so we wrapped this around a blob like form which is in the shape of a teddy bear which was hanging from the ceiling  
 and the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe
 into the familiar form of a teddy bear which is very comforting and intimate 
 and the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night
  sky
 so this is the last work and a work in progress  and it 's called space filler well imagine a small cube that 's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room and as you approached it it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that 's
 twice its height and [ eight ] times its volume and so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it
 almost like it were trying to conceal a
  secret within its seams or something  so we work with a lot of technology but
 we don 't really love technology because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years  but we use it because we 're interested in the way that it
 can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create 
 and once a creature pops into our minds 
 it 's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move thank you
