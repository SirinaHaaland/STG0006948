  i started juggling a long time ago but long before that i was a golfer and that 's what i was a golfer and
 as a golfer and as a kid one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that i sort of lived my whole life is process
  process and it 's the process of learning things one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer but he was lefty  
 and he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology
 about ben hogan and
 various things  well  i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know know stuff about
  and that was the mythology of skill so one of the things that i love to do is to explore skill and since richard put me on this whole thing with music
 i 'm supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab it relates a lot to music  
 but tod couldn 't come and the project is sort of somewhere i 'm not sure whether it 's happening the way we thought or not  but i 'm going to explore skill and
  visual music i guess  ok you can start the music
 the
  can be a lot of fun play with skill and play with space play with rhythm and you can turn the mike on now
  do a couple of pieces i do a big piece in a triangle
 and these are three sections from it  part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space
 using not just my hands because a lot of juggling is   hand oriented but using the rhythm of my body and feet  and controlling the balls with my feet
  next section was an attempt to explore space you see i think richard said something about people that are against something  well a lot of people think jugglers
 defy gravity or do stuff well i kind of from my childhood and golf and all that it 's a process of joining with forces
  so what i 'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique  so juggling gravity
 up down if you figure out what up and down really are it
 's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up
  but then you add in sideways
  i look at it somewhat as a way when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands
 because you 're not looking at your hands you 're looking at where the balls are or you 're looking at the audience 
 so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm 
 with the obvious reference to the feet  but it 's also
 where the feet were where the balls were
  and remember you 're transposing you 're getting into a subculture here 
 and juggling the balls cross and all that ok if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines
 of different heights  but then hopefully even rhythm and you can change the rhythm
 good
 you can change the rhythm if you get out of the lights  ok  change the rhythm so it 's even or you can go back
 and change the height  
 now  skill   but you 're boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way so you 've got to go after the space down there
  because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you and
 then you get crazy
  i 'm actually going to ask you to try something so you 've got to pay attention  complexity
 if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions perceptions change 
 it 's learning skills like being in a high speed car crash 
 things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn  you may not be able to affect it
  almost drifts on you it goes  but that 's the closest approximation i can have to it  so  complexity now how many here are jugglers
 ok  so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this
  it looks like a mess it looks like a mess with a guy there who 's got his hands around that mess  ok  well that 's what juggling is about right it 's
 being able to do something that other people can 't do or can 't understand all right so that 's one way of doing it which is five balls down  ok  another way
  but let 's try something  ok  so since you all don 't understand what the five ball pattern is i 'm going
  let 's actually learn something actually  let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure
  what you 're going to learn is this 
 ok  so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it
  lot of different learning processes going on in here 
 one learning process that i see is this 
  shake your hands out  now  i assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer  ok  so what you 're doing is you 're going la
  and you 're getting this  ok  so that 's exactly what i 'm going to ask you to do but in a slightly different way  you 're going to combine it  so what i want you to do is
 fingers i 'll tell you what to do with your fingers same thing but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball
 that i ask you to follow 
  going to start off looking at the white ball and i 'm going to tell you which color and i 'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers
  reason i wanted you to do this is because that 's actually what most people face
 throughout their lives  a moment of learning a moment of challenge it 's a moment that you can 't make sense of why the hell should i
  anything to do with anything in my life you know i can 't decipher is it fun is it challenging am i supposed to cheat you know what are you supposed to
 do you 've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life  
 ok  trying to figure that stuff out but is it going to get you anywhere  it 's just a moment
  that 's all it is a moment  ok  i 'm going to change the script for one second just let me do this i don 't need music for it talking about time in a moment there 's a piece that i recently developed
 which was all about that  
 a moment  
 and what i do as a creative artist is i develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects what i 've done for you here  i developed a lot of those tricks and i put the choreography together  but they 're not original techniques
  i 'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that i 've developed ok  so  a moment  how would you define a moment  well as a juggler 
 what i wanted to do
 was create something that was representational of a moment
  what i did as a juggler was say ok  what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else
  something in here and you can all have a guess as to what it is there 's a mystery there 's a mystery in the moment  and it
 and then it 's dependent on something else
  and then it comes to rest 
 just a little thing about time now this has expanded into a much bigger piece because i use ramps of different parabolas that i roll the balls on while i 'm keeping time with this  but i just thought i 'd talk about a moment
  can we show the video of the triangle are we ready to do that yes 
 this is the piece that i told you about it 's a much bigger piece that i do exploring the space of a geometric triangle
  ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at one hundred and twenty miles an hour 
 the only other thing is it was a real shock i always drove motorcycles  and when i bought my first car 
 it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents ' house
  making up the rules so you can 't cheat  so you learn
 to approach stillness
  with different parts of your body 
 to have a conversation with it 
 to speak 
 to listen hup 
 now it 's dependent on rhythm and
 keeping a center of balance when it falls going
  a rhythm to it 
 the rhythm
 can get much smaller 
 as your skill increases you learn to find
 those tinier spaces 
 those tinier movements thanks now
 i 'm going to show you the beginnings
 piece
 that
 is about balance
 in some ways  and also oh actually  if you 're bored not here here
 's one use for it 
 the
 the
 the
  i apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb square and level  
 and they influenced that and this next piece which i 'll do a little segment of two sticks you can go with it thanks  
 which is again exploring space
  working with space and the lines in space in a different way
  time
  but working with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it this
 is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls
  and then
 creating space
 and the rhythm of space using the surface of the balls the surface of the arms just a little toy  
 which leads me to the next thing  which is
 what have i got here
  i 'm actually leading up to something  the newest thing that i 'm working on this is not it  this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape
  just did was i worked with the mathematics
 the diameter and the circumference  sometimes these pieces are mathematical in that way that i look at a shape and say what about
  i use this and this and this sometimes what happens in life
 affects my choice of objects that i try to work with the next piece that i 'm going to do which is the cylinders piece if you want to get that up
 it has to do with cylinder seals from about five thousand years ago which were
 stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay
 with all sorts of great designs i love ceramics and all of that it 's a combination of that  the beauty of that  the shape 
 and
 the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they
 protected the contents the second influence on this piece came from
 recycling
 and looking into a tin can recycling bin
 and seeing all that beautiful emptiness so if you want to go with the music for cylinders
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
  talking about geometry and everything  if you take
 the circle and you split it in half can you run s curve music i 'm going to do just a short version of it
  circles split in half
 the
  kinetic sculpture in the middle of it and i dance around a small stage so
 two minutes just to end the latest piece that i 'm working on
 what i love is that i never know what i 'm working on why i 'm working on it  they 're not ideas they 're instincts and the latest thing that i 'm working on
 something really
 i don 't know what it is yet  
 and that 's good  i like not to know for as long as possible
  well because then it tells me the truth  instead of me imposing the truth 
  is working with both positive and negative space
 but also with these curves and what it involves and i don 't know if my hands are
 too beaten up to do it or not but i 'll do a little bit of it  it initially started off with me stacking these things bunches of them  and then playing with
 the sense of space of filling in the space and then it started
  and become folding on themselves
 and then changing levels 
 because my attempt
 is to make visual instruments not to just make i 'll try one other thing 
 for work in three dimensions with your
  perceptions of space
 and time  now i don 't know exactly where it 's going but i 've got a bit
 bit of effort involved in this thing  and it 's going to change as i go through it  
 but i really like it it feels right  this may not be the right shape 
 and look at this shape and then i 'll show you the first design i ever put to it  
 just to see just to play
 i love all different kinds of things to play with let 's see here to work with the positive and negative in a different way  
 and to change  and to change so i 'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space we 'll see what i come
