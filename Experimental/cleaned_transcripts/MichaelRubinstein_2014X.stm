  have revolutionized our world they revealed to us a tiny world of objects life and structures that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes
  contribution to science and technology  today i 'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope a microscope for changes  
 it doesn 't use optics like a regular microscope to make small objects bigger  but instead it uses a video camera
 and image processing to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes
 and it lets us look at our world in a completely new way  
 so what do i mean by color changes our skin for example changes its color very slightly when the blood flows under it
 that change is incredibly subtle  
 which is why when you look at other people when you look at the person sitting next to you you don 't see their skin or their face changing color 
 when we look at this video of steve here it appears
  to us like a static picture  
 but once we look at this video through our new special microscope  suddenly we see a completely different image what you see here are small changes in the color of steve 's skin magnified one hundred times so that they become visible  
 we can actually see a human pulse  
 we can see how fast steve 's heart is beating  but we can also see the actual way
 that the blood flows in his face 
 and we can do that not just to visualize the pulse  
 but also to actually recover our heart heart rates  and measure our heart rates  and we can do it with regular cameras
 and without touching the patients  so here you see
 the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby from a video we took with a regular dslr camera and the
  heart rate measurement we get is as accurate as the one you 'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital  
 and it doesn 't even have to be a video we recorded we can do it essentially with other videos as well  so i just took a short clip from batman begins here
 just to show christian bale 's pulse 
 and you know presumably he 's wearing makeup the lighting here is kind of challenging but still just from the video
  extract his pulse and show it quite well  so how do we do all that we basically analyze the changes
 in the light that are recorded at every pixel in the video over time  and then we crank up those changes we make them bigger so that we can see them the tricky part is that those signals those changes that we 're after are extremely
  so we have to be very careful when you try to separate them from noise that always exists in videos  so we use some clever
 image processing techniques
 to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video  and then the way the color changes over time  
 and then we amplify those changes  we make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos or magnified videos  that actually show us those changes
  but it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color  but also tiny motions and that 's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras
 will change not only if the color of the object changes but also if the object moves  so this is my daughter
 when she was about two months old  it 's a video i recorded
 about
 three years ago and as new parents we all want to make sure our babies are healthy that they 're breathing that they 're alive of course  so i too got one of those
  baby monitors so that i could see my daughter when she was asleep  and this is pretty much what you 'll see with a standard
 baby monitor
 you can see the baby 's sleeping  but there 's not too much information there there 's not too much we can see wouldn 't it be better or more informative or more useful if instead we could look at the view like this  
 so here i took the motions
 and i magnified them thirty times  and then i could clearly
  see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing 
  comparison so again in the source video in the original video there 's not too much we can see  but once we magnify the motions the breathing becomes much more visible  and it turns out there 's a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope
  we can see how our our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies  we can see that our eyes are constantly moving in this wobbly motion 
 and that 's actually my eye  and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born so you can see i wasn 't getting too much sleep 
 even when a person is sitting still  
 there 's a lot of information we can extract about their breathing patterns small facial expressions  maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts
 or our emotions  we can also magnify small mechanical movements like vibrations in engines that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems or 
  see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces those are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways  but measuring those motions is one thing and actually seeing those motions as they happen is a whole
  different thing  and ever since we discovered this
 new technology we made our code available online so that others could use and experiment with it it 's very simple to use it
 can work on your own videos 
 our collaborators at quanta research even created this nice website where you can upload your videos and process them online so even if you don 't have any experience in computer science or programming you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope
 'd like to show you just a couple of examples of what others have done with it  so 
  this video was made by
 a youtube user called tamez85 i don 't know who that user is but he or she used our code to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy it
 's kind of creepy
  people have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands  and you know it 's not real science unless you use guinea pigs  
 and apparently this guinea pig is called tiffany  and this youtube user claims it is the first rodent on earth that was motion magnified 
 you can also do some art with it 
 so this video was sent to me by a design student at yale  she wanted to see if there 's any difference in the way her classmates move  she made them all stand still
  and then magnified their motions  it 's like seeing still pictures come to life 
 and the nice thing with all those examples is that we had nothing to do with them  we just provided this new tool a new way to look at the world  
 and then people find other interesting new and creative ways of using it  
 but we didn 't stop
  this tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way  it also redefines what we can do and pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras  
 so as scientists  we started wondering what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions that we could now use our cameras to measure 
 and one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound 
 sound as we all know is basically changes in air pressure that travel through the air those pressure waves hit objects and they create small
  in them  which is how we hear and how we record sound  but it turns out that sound also produces visual motions 
 those are motions that are not visible to us but are visible to a camera with the right processing  
 so here are two examples this is me demonstrating my great singing skills 
  and i took a high speed video of my throat while i was humming again if you stare at that video there 's not too much you 'll be able to see but once we magnify the motions one hundred times  we can see all the motions and ripples in the neck that are involved in producing the sound 
 that signal is there in that video 
 we also know that singers can break a wine glass if they hit the correct note  so here we 're going to play a note that 's in the resonance
 frequency of that glass through a loudspeaker that 's next to it once we play that note and magnify the motions two hundred and fifty times  
 we can very clearly see how the glass vibrates and resonates in response to the sound it
 's not something you 're used to seeing every day  but this
 this made us think it gave us this crazy idea can we actually invert this process
 and recover sound from video
 by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects and essentially
 convert those back into the sounds that produced them in this way we can turn everyday objects into microphones 
 so that 's exactly what we did  so here 's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table  
 and we 're going to turn that bag of chips into a microphone by filming it with a video camera and analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it  so here 's the sound that we played in the room
 and this is a high speed video we recorded of that bag of chips again it 's playing  there 's no chance you 'll be able to see anything going on in that video just by looking at it but here 's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing the tiny motions in that
 audio signals from video signals and just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here a pretty loud sound
 will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer that 's one thousandth of a millimeter 
 that 's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off
  and gets recorded by our cameras  we can recover sounds from other objects like plants
  had a little lamb because those those are said to be the first words that thomas edison spoke into his phonograph
  it was one of the first sound recording devices in history it basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm
 that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder here 's a demonstration of
 recording and replaying sound with edison 's phonograph
  able to get sound in pretty much similar quality but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras
  we can even do that when the camera is fifteen feet away from the object behind soundproof glass  so this is the sound that we were able to recover in that case
 laughter but it might actually be useful for other
 things as well  maybe in the future we 'll be able to use it for example to recover sound across space  because sound can 't travel in space but light can 
 we 've only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology  it lets us see physical
  processes that we know are there
 but that we 've never been able to see with our own eyes
 until now 
 this is our team  everything i showed you today is a result of a collaboration with this great group of people you see here and i encourage you and welcome you to check out our website try it out yourself  and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions
