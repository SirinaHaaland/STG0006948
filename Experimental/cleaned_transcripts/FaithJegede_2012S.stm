  i have just one request please don 't tell me i 'm normal
  speechless  but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot 
 remi knows what love is he shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless  
 he 's not greedy  
 he doesn 't see skin color he doesn 't care about religious differences and
  he has never told a lie 
 when he sings songs from our childhood  attempting words that not even i could remember he reminds me of one thing 
 how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be 
 samuel is sixteen  he 's tall  he 's very handsome  he has the
  has a selective one though he doesn 't remember if he stole my chocolate bar  but he remembers the year of release for every song on my ipod  
 conversations we had when he was four weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of teletubbies and lady gaga 's birthday 
 don 't they sound incredible  but most people don 't agree  and in fact  because their minds don 't
  into society 's version of normal they 're often bypassed and misunderstood  but what lifted my heart
 and strengthened my soul
 was that even though this was the case  although they were not seen as ordinary  this could only mean one thing 
 that they were extraordinary
  for you who may be less familiar with the term autism it 's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication learning and sometimes physical
 skills it manifests in each individual differently  hence why remi is so different from sam 
 and across the world every twenty minutes one new person is diagnosed with autism  
 and although it 's one of the
  in the world there is no known cause or cure  
 and i cannot remember the first moment i encountered autism but i cannot recall a day without it 
 i was just three years old when my brother came along and i was so excited
 that
 i had a new being in my life  and after a few months went by i realized that he was different  he screamed a lot
 he
 didn 't want to play like the other babies did  and in fact he didn 't seem very interested in me whatsoever  
 remi lived and reigned in his own world with his own rules and he found pleasure in the smallest things like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between  
 and as he grew older he grew more
  different and the differences became more obvious  yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never ending hyperactivity
 was something really unique 
 a pure and innocent nature a boy who saw the world without prejudice a human
 who had never lied extraordinary
  now i cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family moments where i 've wished that they were just like me but
 i cast my mind back to the things that they 've taught me about individuality and communication and love  
 and i realize that these are things that
 i wouldn 't want to change with
  overlooks the beauty that differences give us  
 and the fact that we are different doesn 't mean that one of us is wrong it just means that there 's a different kind of right  
 and if i could communicate just one thing to remi
 and to sam
 and to you it would be that you don 't have to be normal you can be extraordinary
  because autistic or not the differences that we have
 we 've got a gift everyone 's got a gift inside of us  
 and in all honesty the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential 
 the chance for greatness for progress and for change
 dies the moment we try to be like someone else
