  please throw out the beanbag chairs here we go barry friedman there are all kinds of high tech chairs here today but this is really i think when it it reached its peak as far as ergonomics comfort design 
 now obviously this is not something we do on our regular show it 's something we just
  kind of learned for this so we 're going to try but can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag
  sometimes when people do those they go all the way down you actually just did that 
 that 's the kind of extra effort that 's gotten us where we are today
  michael moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on right now dan 's going to show something he actually invented dh a type of juggling i actually invented 
 right after i saw another juggler do it
  it 's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down
  do six cups  i must have perfect control over three with my right hand
  cups should i do it on the first try or should i miss once on purpose
  's time for richard 's help
  could we work on the design of the microphone bf i think that 's the next session dh next session bf yeah  and
 so we 've actually found a way to incorporate richard in this he actually assumes more of the danger in this
  dan used to actually hold them but now he 's got you for protection  it 's kind of
  phone calls are coming back to me now richard
  want to hold these trust me
 spread your legs a little bit
  get too close 
 could you just push that
  that 's cool i always wanted to try that dh let
 's jump this way though 
 now we risked richard 's life  it 's only fair we risk our own lives 
 so to do that  i will juggle these three
  i 'm going to run up behind him dh leap over my shoulder bf up and over his shoulders dh grab the blades in mid air land right there in a pool of blood
  do this trick but please remember it took us over ten years to perfect bf ten years to perfect which you 're about to see dh it 's not that difficult we just don 't like to practice that much
 actually we will take a second to prove this could be fake that the blades are indeed razor sharp dh will someone please throw a small farm animal up
  could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs is that possible
  a visual 
 the design of the body is a whole different thing dh ready barry bf over the top dh may we have our jumping music please may we have it a bit louder
  that 's uncomfortable for everyone dh the french judge bf one more quick thing dh the french judge gives it a five point two
  in our bio some of you may have read that we 've won two world juggling championships  and believe it or not you don 't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups we 're going to show you right now
 an excerpt from a routine that we used
 to wipe out the other juggling team competition dh that 's right
  i know what you 're thinking other juggling teams must really suck bf 
 juggling 's got a bad rap dh 
 but wait barry  there 's still one more club lying there by
  one more by my foot  what do you want me to do with it
 richard you tell him it 's your last
  reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel
  slide the seventh one onto my foot
  eagerly awaits your next syllable
  what gem of knowledge  what pearl of wisdom do you want to buy a vowel  barry 
 is that your final answer bf all right 
 you have to turn off the tv
 from
  the kick up in the seven dh we will juggle seven
  to make this twice as difficult we 'll juggle the seven clubs
