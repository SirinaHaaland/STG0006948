  this is a painting
 from the  16th century from lucas cranach the elder 
 it shows the famous fountain of youth  if you drink its water or you bathe in it you will get
  every culture every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth 
 there are people like alexander the great or ponce de len the explorer  who spent much of their life chasing the fountain of youth 
 they didn 't find it
  but what if there was something to it what if there was something to this fountain
  i will share an absolutely amazing development
 in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging
 and how we may treat age related diseases in the future 
 it started with experiments that showed in a recent number of studies about growing that animals old mice that share a blood supply with
  young mice can get rejuvenated this is similar to what you might see in humans in siamese twins and i know this sounds a bit creepy  
 but
 what tom rando a stem cell researcher reported in two thousand and seven 
 was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it 's exposed to young blood
 through common circulation this was reproduced by amy wagers at harvard a few years later
  then showed
 that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed in the pancreas the liver and the heart  
 but what i 'm most excited about  and several other labs as well is that this may even apply to the brain  
 so what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called
 and a brain that functions better  and i repeat an old mouse
 that gets young blood through shared circulation
 looks younger and functions younger in its brain so when we get older we can look at different aspects of human cognition
  and you can see on this slide here we can look at reasoning  verbal ability and so forth  
 and up to around age fifty or sixty these functions are all intact  and
 as i look at the young audience here in the room we 're all still fine 
 but it 's scary to see how all these curves go south  and as we get older  diseases such as alzheimer 's and
  others may develop 
 we know that with age the connections between neurons the way neurons talk to each other the synapses they start to deteriorate neurons die the brain starts to shrink  
 and there 's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases 
 one big problem we have to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level is that we can 't study the brains in detail in living people
 we can do cognitive tests we can do imaging all kinds of sophisticated testing  but we usually have to wait
 until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease 
 this is what neuropathologists do for example 
 so how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism
  could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body  so if the body ages or gets sick does that affect the brain 
 and vice versa as the brain gets older  does that influence the rest of the body  
 and what connects
  all the different tissues in the body is blood 
 blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen for example the red blood cells or fights infectious diseases  but it also carries carries messenger
 molecules hormone like factors that transport information from one cell to another from one tissue to
  including the brain  so if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age  can we learn something about the brain  
 we know that as we get older  
 the blood changes as well so these hormone like factors change as we get older  and by and large factors that we know are required for the development of tissues for the maintenance
  of tissues they start to decrease as we get older  
 while factors involved in repair in injury and in inflammation they increase as we get older  so there 's this
 unbalance of good and bad factors if you will 
 and to illustrate what we can do potentially with that i want to talk you through an experiment that we did we had almost three hundred blood samples from
  and we measured over one hundred of these
 communication factors these hormone like proteins that transport information between tissues  
 and what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group  about half the factors changed significantly  so our body lives in a very different environment as we get older when it comes to these factors 
 and using statistical or bioinformatics programs we could
  discover those factors that best predict age in a way
  relative age of a person and the way this looks
 is shown in this graph so on the one axis you see the actual
 age a person lived  the chronological age so how many years they lived 
 and then we take these top factors that i showed you and we calculate their relative age
  their biological age  
 and what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation  so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person  but what 's really exciting
 are the outliers as they so often are in life 
 you can see here  the person i highlighted with the green dot is about seventy years of age
 but seems to have a biological
  age  if what we 're doing here is really true of only about forty five so is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age 
 but more importantly is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age related disease and will have a long life will live to one hundred or more 
 on the other
  highlighted with the red dot is not even forty but has a biological age of 
 is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age related disease so in our lab we 're trying to understand these factors better  and many other groups are trying to understand 
 what are the true aging factors and can we learn something about them to possibly predict
  so what i 've shown you so far is simply correlational  right you can just say well these factors change with age but you don 't really know if they do something about aging  
 so what i 'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue 
 and that 's where we come back to
  is done in mice by
 surgically connecting the two mice together  
 and that leads then to a shared blood system where we can now ask how does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood 
 and for this purpose we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20 year old people and old mice that are roughly sixty five years old in human years
  what we found is quite remarkable  we find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains 
 there 's an increased activity of the synapses the connections between neurons 
 there are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories  
 and there 's less of this bad
  the brains of these animals  so when we connect them there are actually no cells going into the old brain in this model  
 instead we 've reasoned then that it must be the soluble factors  so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma  and
  inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice 
 as mice get older  like us humans they have memory problems it 's just harder to detect them but i 'll show you in a minute how we do that
 but we wanted to take this one step further one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans
  human plasma young human plasma  and as a control saline and injected it into old mice and asked 
 can we again rejuvenate these old mice can we make them smarter  
 and to do this we used a test it 's called a barnes maze this is a big table that has lots of holes in
  guide marks around it  
 and there 's a bright light as on this stage here  the mice hate this and they try to escape and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow 
 where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole  
 so we teach them over several days to find this space on these cues in the space and you
 can compare this for humans to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping many of us have probably
 had some problems
 with that so let 's look at an old mouse here 
 this is an old mouse that has memory problems as you 'll notice in a moment 
 it just looks into every hole  
 but it didn 't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day 
 in stark contrast
 this mouse here is a sibling of the same age but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks with small injections every three days  
 and as you noticed it almost looks around where am i and then walks straight to that hole and escapes so it could remember where that hole was 
 so by all means
  this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated it functions more like a younger mouse and it also suggests that there is something
 not only in young mouse plasma but in young human plasma that has the capacity
 to help this old brain so to summarize we find the old mouse and its brain
  not set in stone we can actually change them it can be rejuvenated 
 young blood factors can reverse aging and what i didn 't show you in this model the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old 
 so there are old blood factors that can accelerate aging 
 and most importantly humans may have
  because we can take young human blood
 and have a similar effect old human blood i didn 't show you does not have this effect  it does not make the mice younger 
 so is this magic transferable to humans  we 're running a small clinical study at stanford 
 where we treat alzheimer 's patients with mild disease
 with a pint of
  do this once a week for four weeks and then we look at their brains
 with imaging 
 we test them cognitively  and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living what we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment  
 and if that 's the case that could give us hope that what i showed you works in mice might also work in humans
  now i don 't think we will live forever
  but maybe we discovered that the fountain of youth is actually within us and it has just dried out  
 and if we can turn it back on a little bit 
 maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects 
 we can produce these factors synthetically and we can treat diseases of aging such as alzheimer 's disease or other dementias  thank you very much
