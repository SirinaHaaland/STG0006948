  how much do you get paid don
 't answer that out loud  but put a number in your head  now how much do you think the person sitting next to you gets paid  
  how much do you think the person sitting in the cubicle or the desk next to you gets paid 
 do you know should you know  notice it 's a little uncomfortable for me to even ask you those questions  but admit it
 you kind of want to know  most of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our
  not supposed to tell our neighbors and we 're definitely not supposed to tell our office neighbors 
 the assumed reason is that if everybody knew what everybody got paid  then all hell would break loose there 'd be arguments there 'd be fights there might even be a few people who quit  
 but what if secrecy is actually the reason for all that strife and what would happen if we removed that secrecy 
 what if
 openness actually increased the sense of fairness and collaboration inside a company what would happen if we had total
  pay transparency 
 for the past several years i 've been studying the corporate and entrepreneurial leaders who question the conventional wisdom about how to run a company  
 and the question of pay keeps coming up  and the answers keep surprising 
 it turns out that pay transparency sharing salaries openly across a company makes for a better workplace for both the employee and for the organization
  when people don 't know how their pay compares to their peers ' they 're more likely to feel underpaid and maybe even discriminated against 
 do you want to work at a place that tolerates the idea that you feel underpaid or discriminated against  
 but keeping salaries secret does exactly that and it 's a practice as old as it is common  
 despite the fact that in the united states the law protects an employee 's right to discuss their pay
 in one famous example from decades ago the management of vanity fair magazine actually circulated a memo entitled forbidding discussion among employees of salary received 
 forbidding discussion among employees of salary received  
 now that memo didn 't sit well with everybody new york literary figures dorothy parker robert benchley and robert sherwood all writers in the algonquin round table decided to stand up for
  transparency and showed up for work the next day with their salary written on signs hanging from their neck 
 laughter imagine showing up for work with your salary just written across your chest for all to see  
 but why would a company even want to discourage salary discussions why do some people go along with it while others revolt against it 
 it turns out that in addition to the assumed
  reasons pay secrecy is actually a way to save a lot of money 
 you see  
 keeping salaries secret leads to what economists call information asymmetry this is a situation where in a negotiation one party has loads more information than the other  
 and in hiring or promotion or annual raise discussions  an employer can use that secrecy to save a lot of money  
 imagine how much better you could negotiate for a raise if you
  knew everybody 's salary 
 economists warn that information asymmetry can cause markets to go awry  someone leaves a pay stub on the copier and suddenly everybody is shouting at each other  
 in fact they even warn
 that information asymmetry can lead to a total market failure  and i think we 're almost there here 's why first
  most employees have no idea how their pay compares to their peers ' in a two thousand and fifteen survey of seventy thousand employees
 of everyone who is paid at the market rate said that they felt they were underpaid 
 and of everybody who felt that they were underpaid  sixty percent said that they intended
  regardless of where they were underpaid overpaid or right at the market rate 
 if you were part of this survey what would you say are you underpaid well wait how do you even know  because you 're not allowed to talk about it 
 next 
 information asymmetry pay secrecy makes it easier to ignore the discrimination that 's already present in the market today 
 in a two thousand and eleven report from the institute for women 's policy research the gender wage gap between men and women
  was twenty three percent this is where that seventy seven cents on the dollar comes from 
 but in the federal government where salaries are pinned to certain levels and everybody knows what those levels are the gender wage gap shrinks to eleven percent and this is before controlling for any of the factors that economists argue over whether or not to control for 
 if we really want to close the gender wage gap maybe we should start by opening up the payroll
  this is what total market failure looks like  then openness remains the only way to ensure fairness  
 now i realize that letting people know what you make might feel uncomfortable 
 but isn 't it less uncomfortable than always wondering if you 're being discriminated against or if your wife or your daughter or your sister is being paid unfairly 
 openness remains the best way to ensure fairness and
  transparency does that
 that 's why entrepreneurial leaders and corporate leaders have been experimenting with sharing salaries for years  like dane atkinson dane is a serial entrepreneur who 
 started many companies in a pay secrecy condition and even used that condition to pay two equally qualified people dramatically different salaries depending on how well they could negotiate  
  this so when he started his newest company sumall he committed to salary transparency from the beginning  and the results have been amazing  
 and in study after study when people know how they 're being paid and how that pay compares to their peers ' they 're more likely to work hard to improve their performance more likely to be engaged and they 're less likely to quit 
 that 's why dane 's not alone from technology
  the tens of thousands of employees at whole foods where not only is your salary available for everyone to see  but the performance data for the store and for your department is available on the company intranet for all to see  
 now pay transparency takes a lot of forms it 's not one size fits all some post their salaries for all to see some only keep it inside the company  
 some post the formula for calculating
 pay  and others post the pay levels and affix everybody to that level  so
 you don 't have to make signs for all of your employees to wear around the office and
 you don 't have to be the only one wearing a sign
 that you made at home  
 but we can all take greater steps towards pay transparency for those of you that have the authority to move forward towards transparency it 's time to move forward 
 and for those of you that don 't have that authority it
  to stand up for your right to 
 so how much do you get paid 
 and how does that compare to the people you work with you should know  and so should they
