  i 've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising  
 i remember watching saturday morning cartoons paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head
  ultimately that led me to my dream job i became a partner at a big new york ad agency but then all of that suddenly changed on february 
  and ninety seven when my little brother matt was shot in the head in a shooting
 that happened on the observation deck of the empire state building suddenly my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare
  being told that my brother was going to die  actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him  
 then several emergency brain surgeries and now what 's amounted for matt to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from
 a traumatic brain injury he is definitely
  but as much as
 this tragedy was a nightmare for my family  i often think about how much worse it could have been in fact how much worse it is for the ninety families every day who aren 't as fortunate 
  they don 't all make national headlines in fact most of them don 't they go largely unnoticed in a nation
 that 's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal 
 so i quit my job in advertising to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic
 because i came to realize that the challenges to preventing gun violence are actually the same ones that made me love advertising 
 which is to try to figure out how to engage people only instead of doing it to sell products doing it to save lives  
 and that comes down to finding common ground
  what i want overlaps with what you want and you might be surprised to learn when it comes to gun violence just how much common ground there is let 's look for example at 
 people who love to hunt a sport enjoyed by millions across the us it 's a
  they want to hunt they love their guns  they believe deeply in the second amendment right to own those guns but that doesn 't mean there isn 't common ground in fact there 's a lot of it starting 
  with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands this isn 't about taking certain guns away from all people it 's about 
 keeping all guns away from certain people and it 's the people that it turns out we all agree shouldn 't have guns convicted violent criminals domestic abusers the
 mentally ill  we can all appreciate how brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands in twenty years brady background 
  checks at federally licensed firearm dealers have blocked two point four million gun sales to those people that we all agree shouldn 't have guns
  love guns or hate guns you probably also appreciate that there shouldn 't be thousands of gun sales every day at guns shows or online without those brady background 
  checks just like there shouldn 't be two lines to get on an airplane one with security and one with no security 
 and the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the american public
  ninety percent of americans support expanding brady background checks to all gun sales including ninety percent of republicans more than eighty percent of gun owners more than seventy percent 
 of nra members this is not a controversial idea in fact only six percent of the american public disagrees that 's about the percentage of the american public that believes the moon landing was
  and it 's also about the percentage that believes the government is putting  mind controlling technology in our tv broadcast signals  that 's the extent to which we agree about background checks  but what about 
  the three hundred million guns already out there in homes across america well first it 's important to realize that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes of decent
  like you and me who want what we all want
 including keeping our families safe in fact that 's why more and more people are choosing to own guns  ten years ago forty two percent of the american 
  public believed incorrectly that a gun makes your home safer  
  percent why i kind of hate to
  the dark underbelly of advertising which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times  eventually that lie becomes the truth and that 's exactly what 's happened here the corporate gun lobby has 
  spent billions of dollars blocking the cdc from doing research into the public health epidemic of gun violence  
 to hide the truth because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line and every day people are dying as a result  and a lot of those people are children 
 every day in the us  nine kids are just shot unintentionally  
 nine hundred children and teens take their own lives every year  and here 's the thing  they 're almost all
  a parent 's gun even 
 of school shootings happen with a gun
 taken from the home including the terrible tragedy at sandy hook  i meet so many of these parents it 's the most heartbreaking part of my job  
 these are not bad people they 're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision
  based on very bad information
 that was put into their minds by very bad people who know good and well the misery that they 're causing  but just don 't care  
 and the result is a nightmare not only for families like mine 
 but for really at the end of the day all of us  but i 'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence i 'm here to talk about our dream and it 's a dream
  we all share which is the dream of a better safer future 
 for my organization for the brady campaign that dream is reflected in the bold goal to cut the number of gun deaths in the us in half by 
 and i hope to leave all of you here tonight with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is
 so absolutely within reach  because folks for every great movement around the world 
 there 's a moment where you can look back and say that 's when things really started to change 
 and i 'm here to say that for the movement to end gun violence in america  that moment is here 
 we are so clearly at a tipping point because the american
  public has come together by the millions like never before based on that common ground to say enough enough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters and churches and 
  schools enough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets that 's claimed the lives of women and young black men in staggering
  enough of easy access to guns by the people that we all agree shouldn 't have them  and enough of a small group of craven politicians putting the interests of the corporate gun lobby ahead of the 
  people they have been elected to represent enough and
 the really exciting thing is it 's not just the usual suspects like me that are saying
  it 's so much bigger than that and if you want proof let 's start where most conversations in the us seem to start with kim kardashian 
 laughter and here 's the thing it 's not really a joke i mean think about when issues change it 's when they go from being political and advocacy issues to being part of pop culture voices coming from everywhere 
 celebrities using their platforms  musicians athletes the nba has come forward
  conservative pundits that you never would have imagined have come forward  there 's real cultural change i even hear there 's a ted talk about it this year  that 's the extent to which this cultural 
  change is is happening and yes kim kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal to her thirty five million twitter followers for expanded background checks  let 's look at the political elections that are heating up
  this used to be the classic third rail issue for democrats couldn 't run from it fast enough now candidates are running on it some are being forced to reverse very bad positions they defended very comfortably  until very recently 
 for somebody like me watching people wave around their negative nra ratings
 it 's almost surreal to watch  we 're still outfunded
  by the corporate gun lobby and ultimately that needs to change but you know what we 're smarter
 and we 're scrappier  and we have the truth on our side  and we 're on offense you know they say that the internet democratizes information 
 social media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it have democratized activism it 's allowed us to show what ninety percent support really looks like sometimes i think
  're converging and attacking instantly by the millions kind of like white blood cells it 's enabled us to start to really close and this is the bottom line close that disgraceful 
  disconnect between what the american public wants and what our elected leaders are doing about it until recently 
  we 're flipping that narrative on its head after that recent terrible tragedy in san bernardino  we jammed congressional switchboards we put fifteen thousand calls into congress 
 in twenty four hours and you know what we got a vote on a bill that nobody thought was going to see the light of day anytime soon  we 're seeing real movement to repeal some of the most evil  ugly 
 gun lobby legislation passed over the last dark decade the stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken we 've seen
  president obama 's historic executive actions they don 't go all the way  but they are going to save lives because they expand brady background checks to thousands of gun sales that didn 't have 
  them previously  and we 're marching across the country we 're not just waiting for congress to act that would almost be the definition of insanity  we 're marching across the country state by state
  and you know what we 're winning congress is almost always the last to wake up and realize that it 's on the wrong side of history and when they do  it 's always because the american public shakes them  and that 's exactly what we 're doing right now as we 're in this tipping point you
 know recently i was flying cross country to give a speech to a
 large group like this although far less intimidating  and the woman sitting next to me happened to be  binge watching one of my
  tv shows mad men a period tv show about advertising in the 
 and as i was trying to think about how to end my remarks i 'd glance up at her screen every now and then and it seemed that every time i did  
 i 'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children or while pregnant or drinking and driving or driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a
  coworker  and ultimately it dawned on me what tremendous inspiration to those of us who have this dream
 to end gun violence i mean think about how much the world has changed in a relatively short period of time how all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace 
  or normal some even glamorous or sexy have become stigmatized in just a generation or two once they
  became conversations about our common ground  
 that is the magnitude of the change we have the potential to create around gun violence  and that 's my dream  
 that maybe someday some period tv show
 will depict the terrible nightmare of gun violence and a future generation
  might only be able to imagine how terrible it must have been  thank you
