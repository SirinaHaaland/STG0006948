  i 'm
 doing here 
 i was born in a scots presbyterian ghetto in canada  and dropped out of high school i don 't own a cell phone  
 and i paint on paper
 using gouache which hasn 't changed in six hundred years
  but about three years ago i had an art show in new york and i titled it serious nonsense 
 so i think i 'm actually the first one here i lead i called
 it serious nonsense because on the serious side  i use a technique of painstaking
 realism
 of editorial illustration from when i
 was a kid i copied it and i never unlearned it it 's the only style i know  and it 's very kind of staid and
 formal and meanwhile  i use nonsense as you can see  this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and
 the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor which you can 't see there  this was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book  this is a
  authenticity in a quiet neighborhood in toledo  this is my submission for the l a museum of film  
 you can probably tell frank gehry and i come from the same town my work is
 so personal and so strange that i have to invent my own lexicon for it and
 i work a lot in what i call retrofuturism which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow
 and they 're always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong  
 and the peak time for that was the 30s because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future and technology
 was going to carry us along  this is popular workbench popular science magazines in those days i had a huge collection of them from the '
  all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and
 everything
 improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at three hundred miles an hour it 's all going to happen it 's all going to be wonderful 
 automotive retrofuturism is
 one of my specialties i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject
  has always been halfway into the future the advertising half  this is the ' fifty eight bulgemobile so new they make tomorrow look like yesterday  this is
 a chain gang of guys admiring the car that 's from a whole catalog it 's eighteen pages or so ran back in the days of the lampoon  where i cut my teeth
 is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened
 for good reason usually the zeppelin this was from a brochure about the zeppelin
 based obviously on the hindenburg  but the zeppelin was
 the biggest thing that ever moved made by man and it carried  fifty six people at the speed of a buick
 at an altitude you could hear dogs bark  and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the normandie to fly it
  wasn 't you know it was inevitable it was going to go this 
  jousting in malibu in the 30s the 
 couldn 't wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have it wasn 't a big success it 's the only spanish innovation  technologically of the 20th century by the way 
 you needed to know that the flying car which never got off the ground it was a post war dream
  my old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car  this is pitched into the future from one thousand nine hundred and forty six looking at the day all american families have them 
 there 's moscow shirley hope they speak esperanto 
 faux nostalgia which i 'm sort of not say famous for but i work an awful lot in it it 's the achingly sentimental
 yearning for times that never happened somebody once said that
  nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion
 so i think thats a case for serious play  this is emblematic of it this is wing dining 
 recalling those balmy summer days
 somewhere over france in the 20s dining on the wing of a plane  you can 't see it very well here but that 's hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford
  until the slipstream blows him away  this is tank polo in the south hamptons  
 the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody i do a lot of that 
 and authenticity is a is a major part of my serious nonsense i think it
  and sixteen they had two machine guns and a cannon and they had ninety horsepower ricardo engines they went five miles an hour and inside it was one hundred and five degrees in the pitch dark  
 and they had a canary
 hung inside the thing to
 make sure the germans weren 't going to use gas  
 happy little story isn 't it this is motor ritz towers in manhattan in the 30s where you drove up to your front door if you had the
  guts 
 anybody who was anybody had an apartment there i managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm  
 and i love cigars there 's a cigar billboard down there and faux nostalgia works even even in serious subjects like war  
 this is those wonderful days of the battle of britain in one thousand nine hundred and forty when
  bursts into the house of commons and buzzes around just to piss off churchill who 's down there somewhere it 's a
 fond memory of times past hyperbolic overkill is
 a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute
 ultimate limit just for the fun of it this was a piece i did a brochure again rms
  the biggest thing in all the world the copy which you can 't see because it goes on and on for several pages says that
 steerage passengers can 't get their to bunks before the the voyage is over  and it 's so safe it carries no insurance
 it 's obviously modeled on the titanic  
 but it 's not 's not a cri de coeur about man 's hubris in the face of the elements it 's just a sick  silly joke  
 shamelessly cheap is something  i think this will wake you up it has no
  no meaning  just desoto discovers the mississippi and it 's a desoto
 discovering the mississippi  i did that
 as a quick
 back page i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lampoon  and i did that and i thought well i 'm ashamed i hope nobody knows it people wrote in for reprints of that thing 
  urban absurdism that 's what the new yorker really calls for  i try to
 make life in new york look even weirder than it is with those covers i 've done about forty of them and i 'd say
 thirty of them are are based on that concept i was driving down
 7th avenue one night at three a m and this steam pouring out of the street and i thought what causes that and that
 whos to say the temple of dendur at the metropolitan in
  york it 's a very somber place i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it this is a very un pc cover 
 not in new york  i couldn 't resist  
 and i got a nasty email from some environmental group saying this is too serious and solemn
 to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize
  got around to it yet but
 i may  this is the word side of my brain 
 i love the word eurotrash 
 that 's all the eurotrash coming through jfk customs  
 this was the new york bike messenger meeting the tour de france 
 if you live in new york you know how the
  messengers move  except that he 's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do
 and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the tour de france
 sign of our times i guess  this is the only fashion cover i 've ever done it 's the little old lady that lives in a shoe and then this thing
 the title of that was there goes the neighborhood 
 i don 't know
  a lot about fashion i was told to do what they call a mary jane  
 and then i got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying 
 put a strap on it no don 't put a strap on it put a strap on it  don 't put a strap on it 
 because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it 's bad and i finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe  
 this is a tiny
  people always ask me where do you get your ideas how do your ideas come
  about that one is i had a horrible red wine hangover in the middle of the night this came to me like a xerox all i had to do was write it down
 it was perfectly clear i didn 't do any thinking about it  and then when it ran a lovely lady an old lady named   mrs edgar rosenberg
 if you know that name called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet  her former name was fay wray and so
 that was i didn 't have the
  it will ever be done again successive pages in the front of the magazine it 's the ascent of man using an escalator  and it 's in three parts 
 you can 't see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move
