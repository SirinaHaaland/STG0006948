  i landed for the first time in rome italy  i wasn 't there to sightsee  i was there to solve world hunger
  phd student
 armed with a prototype tool developed back at my university  and i was going to help the world food programme fix hunger  
 so i strode into the headquarters building and my eyes scanned the row of un flags  and i smiled as i thought to myself 
 the engineer is here 
 give me your data  i 'm going to optimize everything
 tell me the food that you 've purchased tell me where it 's going and when it needs to be there  and i 'm going to tell you the shortest fastest cheapest best set of routes to take for the food we
 're going to save money we 're going to avoid delays and disruptions and bottom line we 're going to save lives  you 're welcome 
 i thought it was going to take twelve months ok maybe even thirteen
  this is not quite how it panned out 
 just a couple of months into the project my french boss he told me 
 you know mallory  it 's a good idea but the data you need for your algorithms is not there it
 's the right idea but at the wrong time and the right idea at the wrong time
 is the wrong idea
  i look back now
 on that first summer in rome
 and i see how much has changed over the past six years  it is an absolute transformation  it 's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world  
 it 's exciting  it 's inspiring  but we 're not there yet 
 and brace yourself executives
  'm going to be putting companies on the hot seat to step up and play the role that i know they can 
 my experiences back in rome prove
 using data you can save lives  
 ok not that first attempt  
 but eventually we got there let me paint the picture for you imagine that you have to plan breakfast lunch and dinner for five hundred thousand people
  only have a certain budget to do it say six point five million dollars per month 
 well what should you do what 's the best way to handle it 
 should you buy rice  wheat  chickpea oil how much it sounds simple it 's not 
 you have thirty possible foods  and you have to pick five of them that 's already over one hundred and forty thousand different combinations  then for each food that you pick you need to
  decide how much you 'll buy where you 're going to get it from where you 're going to store it 
 how long it 's going to take to get there  you need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well  and that 's already over nine hundred million options  
 if you considered each option for a single second that would take you over twenty eight years to get through nine hundred million options
  so we created a tool that allowed decisionmakers to weed through all nine hundred million options
 in just a matter of days  
 it turned out to be incredibly successful 
 in an operation in iraq  we saved seventeen percent of the costs  and this meant that you had the ability to feed an additional eighty thousand people it
 's all thanks to the use
 of data and modeling complex systems  but we
  do it alone 
 the unit that i worked with in rome  they were unique they believed in collaboration  they brought in the academic world  they brought in companies  
 and if we really want to make big changes in big problems like world hunger  we need everybody to the table  
 we need the data people from humanitarian organizations leading the way  and orchestrating just the right types of engagements with academics with
  and there 's one group that 's not being leveraged in the way that it should be did you guess it companies companies have a major role to play in fixing the big problems in our world  
 i 've been in the private sector for two years now  i 've seen what companies can do  and i 've seen what companies aren 't doing and i think there 's three main ways that we can fill that gap 
 by donating data  by donating decision scientists and by donating donating technology to gather new sources of data  
 this is data philanthropy  and it 's the
  future of corporate social responsibility  bonus it also makes good business sense 
 companies today  they collect mountains of data  so the first thing they can do is start donating that data  some companies are already doing it 
 take for example a major telecom company  they opened up their data in senegal and the ivory coast
  researchers discovered that if you look at the patterns in the pings to the cell phone towers you can see where people are traveling  and that can tell you things like
 where malaria might spread  and you can make predictions with it 
 or take for example an innovative satellite company  they opened up their data and donated it and with that data you could track how droughts are impacting food production 
 with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen this is a great start
  's important insights just locked away in company data 
 and yes you need to be very careful you need to respect privacy concerns for example by anonymizing the data  
 but even if the floodgates opened up and even if all companies donated their data  to academics to ngos to humanitarian organizations 
 it wouldn 't be enough to harness that full impact of data for humanitarian goals 
 why
 to unlock insights in data you need decision scientists 
 decision scientists are people like me 
 they take the data  they clean it up transform it and put it into a useful algorithm that 's the best choice to address the business need at hand 
 in the world of humanitarian aid there are very few decision scientists  most of them work for companies
  so that 's the second thing that companies need to do in addition to donating their data  they need to donate their decision scientists 
 now companies will say  ah  don 't take our decision scientists from us  we need every spare second of their time 
 but there 's a way 
 if a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist 's time it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time over a long period  say for example five years  
  only amount to a couple of hours per month  which a company would hardly miss  but what it enables is really important long term partnerships
 long term partnerships allow you to build relationships to get to know the data to really understand it
 and to start to understand the needs and challenges that the humanitarian organization is facing in rome at the world food programme this took us five years to do five
  years that first three years  ok that was just what we couldn 't solve for then there was two years after that of refining and implementing the tool like in the operations in iraq
 and other countries  
 i don 't think that 's an unrealistic timeline when it comes to using data to make operational changes  it 's an investment  it requires patience  
 but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable in our case it was the ability to feed
 tens of thousands more people  
 so
 we have donating data  we have donating decision scientists and there 's actually a third way that companies can help 
 donating technology to capture new sources of data you see there 's a lot of things we just don 't have data on 
 right now syrian refugees are flooding into greece 
 and the un refugee agency they have their hands full
 the current system for tracking people is paper and pencil and what that means is that when a mother and her five children walk into the camp  headquarters is essentially blind to this moment 
 that 's all going to change in the next few weeks thanks to private sector collaboration 
 there 's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for with this new system there will be a data trail  so you know exactly
  the moment when that mother and her children walk into the camp  and even more you know if she 's going to have supplies this month and the next 
 information visibility drives efficiency 
 for companies using technology to gather important data  it 's like bread and butter  they 've been doing it for years  and it 's led to major operational efficiency improvements 
 just try to imagine your favorite beverage company
 trying to plan their inventory and
  not knowing how many bottles were on the shelves  it 's absurd data drives better decisions 
 now  if you 're representing a company  and you 're pragmatic and not just idealistic 
 you might be saying to yourself ok  this is all great mallory but why should i want to be involved 
 well for one thing
  and there 's over five billion people  maybe your next customers that live in the developing world  
 further companies that are engaging in data philanthropy  they 're finding new insights locked away in their data  
 take for example a credit card company that 's opened up a center that functions as a hub for academics for ngos and governments all working together  
  they 're looking at information in credit card swipes and using that to find insights about how households in india live work earn and spend 
 for the humanitarian world  this provides information about how you might bring people out of poverty  
 but for companies  it 's providing insights about your customers and potential customers in india  
 it 's a win all around 
 now  for me what i find
 exciting about data philanthropy donating data  donating decision scientists and donating
  technology
 it 's what it means for young professionals like me who are choosing to work at companies  
 studies show that the next generation of the workforce care about having their work make a bigger impact 
 we want to make a difference  
 and so through data philanthropy companies can actually help engage and retain their decision scientists and that 's a big deal for a profession that 's in high demand
  philanthropy makes good business sense  and it also can help revolutionize the humanitarian world  
 if we coordinated the planning and logistics across all of the major facets of a humanitarian operation 
 we could feed clothe and shelter hundreds of thousands more people 
 and companies need to step up and play the role that i know they can in bringing about this revolution
  revolution you 've probably heard of the saying food for thought well this is literally thought for food 
 it finally is
 the right idea at the right time
