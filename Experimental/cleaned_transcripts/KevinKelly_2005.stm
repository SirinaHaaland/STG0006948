  i don 't know about you but
 i haven 't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life  i 've spent the past year thinking about
 what it really should be about should i be
  be wary like you i 'm very tempted by the latest thing but at the other hand a couple of years ago i gave up
 all of my possessions sold all my technology except for a bicycle
 and rode across three thousand miles on the u s back roads under the power of my one body fuelled mostly by twinkies and junk food
  i 've since then tried to keep technology at arm 's length in many ways so it doesn 't master my life 
 at the same time  i run a website on cool tools where i issue
 a daily obsession of the latest things in technology so i 'm still perplexed about
 what the true meaning of technology is
 as it relates to humanity as it relates to nature as it relates to the spiritual and i 'm not even sure we
  we know what technology is  and
 one definition of technology is that which is
 first recorded this is the first
 example of the modern use of technology that i can find it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science
 at cambridge university in
  exist but obviously it did i like one of the definitions that alan kay has for technology  he says
 technology is anything that was invented after you were born 
 so it sums up a lot of what we 're talking about danny hillis actually has an update on that he says
 technology is anything that doesn 't quite work yet
  think gets into a little bit of of our current idea  but i was interested in another definition of technology  something again that went back
 to something more fundamental something that was deeper and
 as i struggled to to understand that i came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to to work
  this morning going to talk about this for the first time so this is a very rough attempt to to think out loud
 the question that i came up with was
 this question  what does technology want  and by that i don 't mean does it want chocolate or vanilla 
 by what it wants i mean  what are its inherent trends and biases what are its tendencies
  one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms which we 've heard a lot about
  and the trick that richard dawkins does which is to say to look at them as simply as genes as vehicles for genes so he 's saying what do genes want the selfish gene  
  and i 'm applying a similar trick to say  what if we looked at the universe in our culture
  what does technology want 
 obviously this in an incomplete question just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it but it 's still very very productive  
 so i 'm attempting to say if we take technology 's view of the world  
 what does it want  
 and i think once we ask that question
 we have to go back actually to life  because obviously if we
  extending the origins of technology far back i think we come back to life at some point so that 's where i want to begin my little exploration is in life  and like you heard from the previous speakers  
 we don 't really know
 what life there is on earth right now  we have really no idea
 craig venter 's tremendous and brilliant attempt to to dna sequence things in the ocean is great brian farrell 's work is all part
  this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on earth and one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly
 go and inspect all the all the places that the grid intersects just to see what 's on life and if we did that with our little martian probe which we have not done on earth  we would begin to see some incredible
 species this is not on another planet  these are things that are hidden away on our planet  this is an ant
  honey in its abdomen each one of these organisms that we 've described that you 've seen from jamie and others these magnificent things what they 're doing 
 each one of them is they 're hacking
 the rules of life  i can 't think of a single general principle of biology that does not
 have an exception somewhere by some organism every single thing that we can think of  and if you heard olivia 's talk about the sexual habits  you 'll realize that
  isn 't anything we can say that 's true for all life  because every single one of them is hacking something about it this is a 
 sea slug it 's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it
 to drive its energy  
 this is another version of that this is a sea dragon  and the one on the bottom the blue one is a juvenile that has not yet
  swallowed the acid has not yet taken in the  brown green algae pond scum into its body
 to to give it energy these are hacks  and
 if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are 
 current consensus six kingdoms  six different broad approaches the plants the animals the fungi  the protests the little things
  bacteria and the archaea bacteria the archaeas 
 those are the general approaches to life  
 that 's one way to look at life on earth today but a more interesting way the current way to take the long view is to look at it in an evolutionary
 perspective and here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time we
  it coming out from the center  so in the center is the most primitive  and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth  this is all the same six kingdoms you see four thousand representative 
 species and you can see where we are but what i like about this is it shows that every living organism on earth today
  fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved
 as humans they 've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of of trial and error to get here  
 but we see that each one of these is actually
 hacking and has a different way of finding out how to do life and if we take the  long term trends of life if we begin to say   what does evolution want  
 there 's several things that we see one of the things about
  have we ever been where we don 't find life  we find life at the bottom of every 
  drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up and there 's bacteria in the pores of that rock 
 and wherever life is it never retreats  it 's ubiquitous and it wants to be more more and more of the inert matter of the of the globe is being touched and animated by life
  the second thing is is we see
 diversity  we also see specialization we see the movement from a general purpose cell to the more specific and
 specialized and we see a drift towards complexity
 that 's very intuitive and actually we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over
  and the last thing i bring back this nudibranch one of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability and by that it means
 that there is more and more of life
 whose entire environment is other life  like those chloroplast cells they 're completely surrounded by other life they never touch the inner matter there is more and more
  complexity
 and socialization now  i took that and said ok  what are the  long term trends in technology and again
 my question is what does technology want
 and so remarkably  i discovered that there 's also a drift toward specialization 
  we see there 's a general hammer and hammers become more and more specific over time  there 's
 obviously diversity huge numbers of things  this is all the contents of a japanese home i actually had my daughter gave her a tally counter and i gave her an assignment last 
  summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household  and it came up with six thousand different species of products
  i did some research and found out that the king of england  henry viii had only about seven thousand items in his household and he was the king of england  and that was the entire wealth of england at the time  so we 're seeing huge numbers of of diversity in the kinds of things 
 this is
 a scene from star wars where the 3po comes out and he sees machines making machines how depraved  well  this is actually
 what we 're headed towards world machines
  is only being thrown out by other technologies most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not not non technology or even life  
 and thirdly the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is
 at this point a cliche and i 'm happy to say i was partly responsible for that cliche
 that machines are becoming biological but that 's pretty evident so the major trends in
 technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution
  the same drives that we see towards ubiquity towards diversity towards socialization  towards complexity that is maybe not a big surprise
 because if we
 map out say the evolution of of armor  you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary type cladistic tree  
 i suggest that in fact technology is the seventh kingdom of life  that its operations and how it
  works is so similar
 that we can think of it
 as the seventh kingdom  
 and so it would be sort of approximately up there coming out of the animal kingdom  
 and if we were to do that we would find out
 we could actually approach technology in this way  this is niles eldredge 
  with stephen jay gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium  but as a sideline he happens to collect cornets he has one of the world 's largest collections
 about five hundred of them and he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites or snails and to do a morphological analysis  and try to derive
 their genealogical history over time  this is his chart which is not quite published yet but the most interesting aspect about this
 is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom those
  indicate
 basically
 a parentage of of a type of of cornet that was no longer made 
 that does not happen in biology 
 when something is extinct you can 't have it as your parent  but that does happen in technology and it turns out that that 's so distinctive
 that you can actually look at
  this tree and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system in fact this idea
 of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about
 what happens with old technology and it turns out that in fact  
 technologies don 't die  so i suggested this to an historian of science and he said well what about you know come on what about steam
  so around
 that you can buy new parts for a stanley steam automobile  
 and this is a website of a guy who 's selling brand new parts for the stanley automobile  and the thing that
  think about
 well maybe that 's just a random sample maybe i should do this sort of in a more conservative way so i took the great big one thousand eight hundred and ninety five montgomery ward 's catalog 
 and i randomly went through it and i took a page not quite a random page i took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made  but i took this page
  things
 are still being made and not antiques  i want to know how many of these things are still in production  and the answer is all of them 
 all of them are still being produced 
 so you 've got corn shellers i don 't know who needs a corn sheller be it corn shellers you 've
  you 've got fan mills all these things and these are not again antiques these are you can order these you can go to the web and you can buy them now brand new made  so in a certain sense  
 technologies don 't die in fact
  you can buy for fifty bucks
  a stone age knife made exactly the same way that they were made ten thousand
  what 's important is that this information actually never died out it 's not just that it was resurrected it 's continued all along and in papua new guinea they were making stone axes until two decades ago just
 as a course of of practical matters even when we try to get rid
 of a technology it 's actually very hard  so we 've all heard about the
  amish giving up cars we 've heard about the japanese giving up guns we 've heard about this and that  but i actually went back and took
 what i could find  the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology  
 and then i tried to find out when they came back in because they always came back in and it turns out that the time  the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited is decreasing over time 
  and that basically you can delay technology  but you can 't kill it  so this makes sense because in a certain sense what culture is 
 is the accumulation of ideas  that 's what it 's for it 's so that ideas don 't die out and when we take that 
 we take this idea of what culture is doing
 and add it to what the long term trajectory again in life 's evolution we find that each case each of the major transitions in life what they 're really about is accelerating and changing the way
  which evolution happens 
 they 're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated  
 so all these steps in evolution are increasing basically the evolution of evolvability so what 's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas these new hacks 
 are increasing  and the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring  
 and then what we see in the singularity
 that prophesized by kurzweil and others his idea that
 technology is accelerating evolution it 's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas 
 so if you have life hacking life means hacking 
 the game of survival then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game and what technology is really about is better ways to evolve  
 that is what we call an
 that 's the definition of infinite game a finite game is play to win and an infinite game is played to keep playing 
 and i believe that technology is actually
 a cosmic force the origins of technology was not in one thousand eight hundred and twenty nine but was actually at the beginning of the big bang and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed the entire universe was compressed into a
  quantum dot  and it was so tight in there there was no room for any difference at all that 's the definition there was no temperature there was no difference whatsoever  and at the big bang what it expanded was the potential for difference 
 so as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences diversity  options
  possibilities and freedoms those are all basically the same thing  and those are the things that technology brings us  
 that 's what technology is bringing us  choices  possibilities  freedoms  that 's what it 's about it 's this expansion of room to make differences  and so
 a hammer  when we grab a hammer that 's what we 're grabbing and that 's why we continue to grab technology because
 we want those things those things
  each time we make a new opportunity place we 're allowing
 a platform to make new ones  and i think it 's really important because if you can imagine mozart before the technology of the piano was invented
 what a loss to society there would be imagine van gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints  imagine
 hitchcock
  there are millions of young children being born
 whose technology
 of of self expression has not yet been invented we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true 
 difference we want a trillion zillion species of one individuals  that 's what technology really
  'm going to skip through some of the objections because i don 't have answers to why
 there 's deforestation i don 't have an answer to the fact that there
 seem to be bad technologies i don 't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity other than to suggest that
 maybe the seventh kingdom because it 's so close to what life is about 
 maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life  maybe in some ways the
 fact that that what we 're trying to do with
  technology is find a good home for it it 's a terrible thing to spray ddt
 on cotton fields but it 's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village 
 our humanity is actually defined by technology all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology  
 this is the infinite game  that 's what we 're talking about you see
  technology is a way to evolve the evolution it 's a way to
 explore possibilities and opportunities and create more and it 's actually a way of playing the game of playing all the games  
 that 's what technology wants  and so
 when i think about what technology wants i think that it has to do with the fact that every person here and i really believe this every person here
  has an assignment and your assignment is
 to spend your life discovering what your assignment is 
 that recursive nature is the infinite game  and if you play that well you 'll have other people involved so even that game extends and continues even when you 're gone that 
 is the infinite game and what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game  and so i think that we should embrace
