  when i was nine years old my mom asked me what i would want my house to look like and i drew this fairy mushroom and then
 she actually built it 
 i don 't think i realized this was so unusual at the time and maybe i still haven
 i 'm still designing houses 
 this is a six story bespoke home on the island of bali  it 's built almost entirely from bamboo 
 the living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor you enter the house by a bridge 
 it can get hot in the tropics  so we make big curving roofs to catch
  the breezes  but some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out  
 this room we left open  we made an air conditioned tented bed 
 and one client wanted a tv room in the corner of her living room boxing off an area with tall walls just didn 't feel right  so instead we
  made this giant woven pod 
 now  we do have all the necessary luxuries like bathrooms this one is a basket
 in the corner of the living room 
 and i 've got tell you some people actually hesitate to use it we have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation 
 so there are lots of things that we 're still working on
  one thing i have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right it
 's actually a wild grass  it grows on otherwise unproductive land deep ravines  mountainsides  
 it lives off of rainwater  spring water  sunlight  
 and of the one thousand four hundred and fifty species of bamboo that grow across the world we use just seven of them
 that 's my dad he 's the one who got me building with bamboo and he is standing in a clump
 of 
  dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago 
 each year it sends up a new generation of shoots that shoot we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week  so we 're talking about
  as we call it it 's really long up to eighteen meters of usable length try getting that truck down the mountain  
 and it 's strong  it has the tensile strength of steel the compressive strength of concrete  
 slam four tons straight down on a pole  and it can take it 
 because it 's hollow  it 's lightweight
  light enough to be lifted by just a few men or apparently one woman 
 and when my father built green school in bali  he chose bamboo
 for all of the buildings on campus  because he saw it as a promise  it 's a promise to the kids  it 's one sustainable material that they will not run out of  
 and when i first saw these structures under construction about six years ago 
 i just thought  this makes perfect sense  it is growing all around us  it 's strong  it 's elegant
 why hasn 't this happened sooner and what can we do with it next so
 along with some of the original builders of green school 
 i founded ibuku ibu means mother and ku means mine so it represents my mother earth  
 and at ibuku we are a team of artisans  architects and designers and what we 're doing
 together is creating a new way of building over the past five years together
  we have built over fifty unique structures most of them in bali nine of them are at green village
 you 've just seen inside some of these homes
 and we fill them with bespoke furniture  we surround them with veggie gardens  we would love to invite you all to come visit someday
  and while you 're there you can also see green school we keep building classrooms there each year as well as an updated fairy mushroom house 
 we 're also working on a little house for export 
 this is a traditional sumbanese home that we replicated right down to the details and textiles 
 a restaurant
 with
  lot like a kitchen right  
 and a bridge that spans twenty two meters across a river  
 now  what we 're doing  it 's not entirely new from little huts to elaborate bridges
 like this one in java bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world for literally tens of thousands of years 
 there are islands and even continents
 that were first reached by bamboo rafts
  but until recently it
 was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects  and so just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone  
 unprotected bamboo weathers  untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust  and so that 's why most people
  especially in asia think that you couldn 't be poor enough
 or rural enough to actually want to live in a bamboo house  
 and so we thought what will it take to change their minds to convince people
 that bamboo is worth building with  much less worth aspiring to 
 first  we needed safe treatment solutions  borax is a natural salt it turns bamboo into a viable building
  treat it properly design it carefully  and a bamboo structure can last a lifetime  
 second  build something extraordinary out of it inspire people 
 fortunately  balinese culture fosters craftsmanship it values the artisan 
 so combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects
  formulas and vocabulary of architecture do not apply here  we have had to invent our own rules  we ask the bamboo what it 's good at 
 what it wants to become  and what it says is
  respect it design for its strengths protect it from water  and to make the most of its curves  
 so we design in real 3d making scale structural models out of the same material that we 'll later use to build the house  
 and bamboo model making it 's an art as well as some hardcore engineering
  that 's the blueprint of the house 
 and we bring it to site  and with tiny rulers we measure each pole  
 and consider each curve and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile
 to replicate that house on site 
 when it comes down to the details we consider everything
  why are doors so often rectangular  why not round  
 how could you make a door better well its hinges battle with gravity and gravity will always win in the end so
 why not have it pivot on the center where it can stay balanced  and while you 're at it why not doors shaped like teardrops 
 to reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints of this material  we have really had to
  and within that constraint  we have found space for something new 
 it 's a challenge how do you make a ceiling if you don 't have any flat boards to work with let me tell you sometimes i dream
 of sheet rock and plywood 
 but if what you 've got is skilled craftsmen and itsy bitsy little
  weave that ceiling together  
 stretch a canvas over it lacquer it 
 how do you design durable kitchen countertops that do justice to this curving structure you 've just built slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread
 hand carve each to fit the other leave the crusts on  
 and what we 're doing  it is almost entirely handmade the structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by steel joints but we use a lot of
  bamboo pins there are thousands of pins in each floor 
 this floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin you can feel the texture under bare feet 
 and the floor that you walk on can it affect the way that you walk can it change the footprint that you 'll ultimately leave on the world 
 i remember being nine years old
  and feeling wonder  and possibility and a little bit of idealism  
 and we 've got a really long way to go there 's a lot left to learn  but one thing i know is that with creativity
 and commitment you can create
 beauty
  and comfort and safety and even luxury out of a material that will grow back thank you
