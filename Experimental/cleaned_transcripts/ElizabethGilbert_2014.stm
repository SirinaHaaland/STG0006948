  a few years ago i was at jfk airport about to get on a flight 
 when i was approached by two women who i do not think would be insulted to hear themselves described as tiny old
  up to me and she goes 
 honey i gotta ask you something 
 you got something to do with that whole ' eat pray love ' thing that 's been going on lately 
 and i said yes i did and she smacks her friend and she goes see i told you i said that 's that girl 
 that 's that girl who wrote that book based on that movie 
 so that 's who i am
  to be that person because that whole eat pray love thing was a huge break for me
 but it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world i was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody because i knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored eat pray love 
 were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever i wrote next because it wasn 't going to be
  who had hated eat pray love were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever i wrote next because it would provide evidence that i still lived  so i knew that i had no way to win
 and knowing that i had no way to win made me seriously consider for a while just quitting the game and and moving to the country to raise corgis  but if i had done that if i had given up writing i would have lost my beloved vocation so i knew that the task was
  that i had to find some way to gin up the inspiration to write the next book regardless of its inevitable negative outcome 
 in other words i had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success  
 and i did in the end find that inspiration but i found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place i found it in lessons that i had learned earlier in life
  about how creativity can survive its own failure 
 so just to back up and explain the only thing i have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer i wrote all through childhood all through adolescence by the time i was a teenager i was sending my very bad stories to the new yorker hoping to be discovered 
 after college i got a job as a diner waitress kept working kept writing kept trying really hard to get published and failing at it i failed at
  getting published for almost six years 
 so for almost six years every single day i had nothing but rejection letters waiting for me in my mailbox and it was devastating every single time and every single time i had to ask myself
 if i should just quit while i was behind and give up and spare myself this pain  
 but then i would find my resolve and always in the same way by saying i 'm not going to quit  i 'm going home and
 you have to understand that for
  going home did not mean returning to my family 's farm for me  going home meant returning to the work of writing because writing was my home because i loved writing more 
  than i hated failing at writing which is to say that i loved writing more than i loved my own ego which is ultimately to say that i loved writing more than i loved myself 
 thinking about her constantly and feeling like i was her again which made no rational sense whatsoever because our lives
 could not have been more different she had failed constantly i had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation we had nothing in common why did i suddenly feel like i was her all over again 
 and it was only when i was trying to unthread that that i finally began to comprehend the strange and unlikely psychological connection in our lives between the way we experience great failure and
  the way we experience great success  
 so think of it like this  for most of your life you live out your existence here in the middle of the chain of human experience where everything is normal and reassuring and regular  
 but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here into the blinding darkness of disappointment 
 success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition
 and praise  
 and one of these fates is objectively seen by the world as bad and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good  but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good 
 the only thing that it is capable of feeling is the absolute value of this emotional equation the exact distance that you have been
  and there 's a real equal danger in both cases of getting lost out there in the hinterlands of the psyche  
 but in both cases it turns out that there is also the same remedy for self restoration and that is that you have got to find your way back home again as swiftly and smoothly as you can 
 and if you 're wondering what your home is here 's a hint your home is whatever in this world you love more than you love yourself  
  might be raising corgis  i don 't know your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential 
 for me that home has always been writing  so after the weird disorienting success
 that i went through with eat pray love i realized that all i had to do was exactly the same thing that i used to have to do all the time when i was an equally disoriented failure i had to get my ass back to work
  that 's what i did and that 's how in two thousand and ten i was able to publish the dreaded follow up to eat pray love and you know what happened with that book it bombed  
 and i was fine actually i kind of felt bulletproof because i knew that i had broken the spell and i had found my way back home to writing for the sheer devotion of it 
 and i stayed in my home of writing after that and i wrote another book that just came out last year and that one was really beautifully received which is very nice but not my point
  my point is that i 'm writing another one now 
 and i 'll write another book after that and another and another and another and many of them will fail and some of them might succeed but i will always be safe from the random hurricanes of outcome as long as i never forget where i rightfully live
  love more than you love yourself
  to find your way back
