  good morning you know  the computer and television both recently turned sixty and today i 'd like to talk about their relationship 
 despite their middle age if you 've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry  it 's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other
 so it 's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces
 that lead to the writers ' strike  and it 's not just what these are doing to each other but it 's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter 
 to get a sense of this and it 's been a theme we 've talked about
  just arrange these from what 's important to you and what 's not  and then tell me why let 's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television girl one 
 well i think it 's important
 but like not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs
 peter hirshberg which is more fun internet or tv girls internet girl two i think we the reasons one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because
 nowadays like we have tv shows on the computer
  eventually girl three like the stock market it goes up and down and stuff  i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff ph 
 there 's been an
 uneasy relationship between the tv business and the tech business really ever since they both turned about thirty we go through periods
  followed by reactions in boardrooms in the finance community best characterized as what 's the finance term  ick pooey  let me give you an example of this the 
  and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise the next year they march forward and they introduce qube the first interactive cable tv system 
 and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home convergence great things are happening everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures citicorp penney
  all getting into this big vision  by the way this is about when i enter the picture i 'm
 going to do a summer internship at time warner that summer i 'm all i 'm at warner that summer i 'm all excited to work on convergence  
 and then the bottom falls out  doesn 't work out too well for them they lose money  and
 i had a happy brush with convergence until kind of warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing that 's when i leave graduate school and
  can 't work in new york on kind of entertainment and technology because i have to be exiled to california  where the remaining jobs are almost to the sea to go to work for apple computer 
 warner of course  writes off more than four hundred million dollars four hundred million dollars  
 which was real money back in the ' 70s 
 but they were onto something and they got better at it by the year two thousand the process was perfected they merged with aol
  and in just four years  managed to shed
 about two hundred billion dollars of market capitalization  
 showing that they 'd actually mastered the art of applying moore 's law of successive miniaturization
 to their balance sheet now i think that one reason that the
  media and the entertainment communities or the media community is driven so
 crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently you know  for fifty years we 've talked about changing the world about total transformation for fifty years it 's been about hopes and fears and and promises of a better world and i got to thinking  
 you know  who else talks that way  and the answer is pretty clearly it 's people in religion
 and and in politics
 and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood
  not as a business cycle but as a messianic movement we promise something great we evangelize it we 're going to change the world it doesn 't work out too well and so
 we actually go back to the well and start all over again as the people in new york and and l a look on in absolute morbid astonishment  but it 's this irrational view of things that drives us on to
  like to ask is if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment 
 how did we get here i mean how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media of course the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems 
 but things got really interesting just a couple of years later one thousand nine hundred and forty nine with whirlwind 
 built at
  's lincoln lab  jay forrester was building this for the navy but you can 't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind
 a machine that might actually be a potential media star so take a look at what happens when
 the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers and the computer begins to express itself
  computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research why don 't we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy
 this rocket goes up one hundred and thirty five miles into the sky 
 now at the standard rate of fuel consumption  i would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket
 and see how it can determine  at any instant say at the end of forty seconds  the amount of fuel remaining  and the velocity
  dropped off to a minimum
  we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that
  you know so much was worked out the first real time interaction the video display 
 pointing a gun it lead to the microcomputer  but unfortunately it was too pricey for the navy and all of this would have been lost if
  for a happy coincidence enter the atomic bomb 
 we 're threatened by the greatest weapon ever and knowing a good thing when it sees it the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us 
 they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system deploy it all across the frozen north and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the manhattan project building the a bomb in the first place
  talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good salesman here 's their marketing video narrator in
 a mass raid  high speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their
  we cannot afford to take that chance  
 it is to meet this threat that the air force has been developing sage
  the semi automatic ground environment system to strengthen our air defenses 
 this new computer  built to become the nerve center of a defense network is able to perform all the complex mathematical
  problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid  it is provided with its own powerhouse
 containing large diesel driven generators air conditioning equipment  and cooling towers
 required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer ph you know that one computer
  's an interesting marketing lesson from it  which is basically when you market a product  you can either say this is going to be wonderful it will make you feel better and enliven you 
 or there 's one other marketing proposition if you don 't use our product you 'll die 
 this is a really good example of that this had the first pointing device 
 it was distributed so it worked out distributed computing and modems so all these things could talk to each other about twenty percent of all the nation
 programmers were wrapped up in this thing  and it led to an awful lot of what we have today  
 it also used vacuum tubes you saw how huge it was and to give you a sense for this because we 've talked a lot about moore 's law and making things small at this conference so let 's talk about making things large  
 if we took whirlwind
 and put it in a place that you all know say century city it would fit beautifully you 'd kind of have to take century city out but it could fit in there
  but like let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor the latest core two extreme which is a four core processor that that intel 's working on it will be our laptop tomorrow
 to build that what we 'd do with whirlwind technology is we 'd have to take up roughly from the ten to mulholland  
 and from the four hundred and five to la cienega just with those whirlwinds  
 and then the ninety two nuclear power plants that it would take to provide
 the power would fill up the rest of los
  angeles that 's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates so the next time they tell you they 're on to something clearly they 're not so
 and we haven 't even worked out the cooling needs  but it gives you the kind of power that people have that the audience has and the reasons these transformations are happening all of this stuff starts moving into industry  dec kind of reduces all this and makes the
  shows up at places like mit  
 and then a mutation happens spacewar is built the first computer game  and all of a sudden interactivity and involvement and and passion is worked out actually 
 many mit students stayed up all night long working on this thing and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out  dec knew a good thing about wasting time it shipped every one of its computers with that game  
  model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls
 and they 're quite certain that television
 is about to do them in in fact despair is in the air 
 and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i 've been reading all week
 rca had david sarnoff who basically commercialized radio said this
 i don 't say that radio networks must die  every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues 
 it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio  but i don 't know how and of course  as the computer industry develops interactively 
 producers in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea
 and they fake it
  we get some of the magic into it boys and girls then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set 
 and rub it out from the center to the corners like this  
 make sure you keep your magic crayons handy your winky dink crayons and your erasing glove  because you 'll be using them during the show to draw like that you all set  ok let 's get right to the first story about dusty man come on into the secret lab
  dawn of interactive tv and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits those are the winky dink crayons i know what you 're saying pete i could use any ordinary open source crayon 
 why do i have to buy theirs i assure you that 's not the case 
 turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window other crayons may discolor or hurt the window  this proprietary principle of vendor
 go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere  it led to lawsuits 
 federal investigations and lots of repercussions and that 's a scandal we won 't discuss today  
 but we will discuss this scandal because this man jack berry the host
  went on to become the host of twenty one 
 one of the most important quiz shows ever  and it was rigged and it became unraveled when this man  charles van doren was outed after an unnatural winning streak  ending berry 's career and actually ending the career of a lot of people at cbs  
 it turns out there was a lot to learn
 about how this new medium worked 
 and fifty years ago if you 'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the media  there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from
  professor marshall mcluhan 
 he actually understood something about a theme that we 've been discussing all week  it 's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications here he is talking from the 
 if the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad 
  's like the old quiz shows  they were great tv because it gave the audience a role something to do 
 they were horrified when they discovered they 'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged  now then this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the
 programmers ph you know mcluhan talked about the global village if you substitute the word blogosphere of the internet today  it is very true that his understanding
  global village is a world in which
 you don 't necessarily have harmony you have extreme concern with everybody else 's business
 and much involvement in everybody else 's life it 's a sort of ann landers  ' column writ large  and it
 doesn 't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet  but it does mean huge involvement in
  everybody else 's affairs  and so the global village is as big as a planet  and as small as a
 village post office ph we 'll talk a little bit more about him later  we 're now right into the 1960s it 's the era of big business and data centers for computing but all that was about to change you know 
 the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations it 's not just a joke about messianism it 's actually what we do
  but for this part of the story i 'd actually like to throw it to america 's leading technology correspondent john markoff john markoff do
 you want to know what the counterculture in drugs sex rock ' n ' roll and the anti war movement had to do with computing everything 
 it all happened within five miles of where i 'm standing at stanford university between one thousand nine hundred and sixty and 
 in the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks a group of
  led by people like john mccarthy a computer scientist at the stanford artificial intelligence lab  and doug engelbart a computer scientist at sri  changed the world 
 engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture  but while he was beginning to do his work all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid peninsula there was lsd leaking out of kesey 's
 veterans ' hospital experiments and
 other areas around the campus 
 and there was music literally in the streets the grateful dead was playing in the pizza parlors people were leaving to go back to the land there was the vietnam war there was black liberation there was women 's liberation
  this was a remarkable place at a remarkable time and into that ferment came the microprocessor
  i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing they saw
 these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build
  and most importantly they had this ethos of sharing information  i think these ideas are difficult to understand because when you 're trapped in one paradigm the next paradigm is always like
 science fiction universe it makes no sense the stories were so compelling that i decided to write a book about them the title of
 the book is what the dormouse said how the ' 60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry 
 the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song  the lyrics go remember what the dormouse said  feed your head  feed your head
  by this time computing had kind of leapt into media territory and in short order much of what we 're doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley  here 's the architecture machine group the predecessor of the media lab
 meanwhile in california  we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks where you could randomly hook to any 
  kind of picture  or piece of text or data across a file system and we had no way of explaining it  there was no metaphor was it a database a prototyping tool
  was everything so we ended up writing a marketing brochure we asked a question about how the mind works and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant  
 a few years
 later we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of how do you get the content you want the way you want it
 and the easy way  here 's the apple marketing video video
  pleased to know i 'm sure that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video  
 the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks 
 by far the simplest method is to buy a pre made videodisc and hypercard stacks from a commercial supplier  
 the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks  this method allows you to use existing videodisc materials
 in ways which suit your specific
  needs and interests ph i hope you realize how subversive that is that 's like a dick cheney speech you think he 's a nice balding guy  but he 's just declared war
 on the content business find the commercial stuff  mash it up tell the story your way now as long as we confine this to the education market and a personal matter between the computer and 
  the file system that 's fine but as you can see it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people
  the way speaking of the filing system  it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network
  a few years later  tim  berners lee worked that out it became a killer app of links and today of course we call that the world wide web  
 now not only was i instrumental in helping apple miss the internet  but a couple of years later i helped bill gates
  he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain
 where we were all heading and how to popularize all this we were plenty aware that we were messing with media and on the surface it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things  
 but we also missed an awful lot 
  new york subway system and
 tv dinners  
 ancient and modern wonders of the man made world all yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of
  once it was only a dream of technoids
 and a few
 long forgotten politicians  the digital highway arrived in america 's living rooms late in the twentieth century  
 let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible
  the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell
 though some were incredulous man one the phone company 
 narrator stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising david
  windows for radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family be sure to enjoy windows for radio at home and at work narrator 
 in one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine the radio corporation of america
  never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand narrator eventually the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the
 telephone company  and further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry  
 and the re regulation of the cable television industry
 once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks  escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas 
 the world and all its culture reduced to bits the lingua franca of
 all media and the forces of convergence
 exploded  finally 
  channels for the gourmet and we 'll see channels for the pet lover voice two 
 next on the gourmet pet channel decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer narrator 
 all of industry was in play  as investors flocked to place their bets at stake  the battle
  you missed we missed the internet the long tail the role of the audience  open systems social networks
  it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media thomas edison had the same problem he wrote a list of
 what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it and kind of only one of his ideas
  turned out to have been the right early idea  well you know where we 're going on from here  we come into the era of the
 dotcom the world wide web and i don 't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together  but when we emerge from this and what we call web two point zero things actually are quite different and 
  i think it 's the reason that tv 's so challenged if internet one was about pages now it 's about people
  audience it 's a person who 's participating
  it 's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now mm because it gave the audience a role something to do ph 
 in my own company technorati  we see something like sixty seven thousand blog posts an hour come in that 's about two thousand seven hundred fresh connective links
 across about one hundred and twelve million blogs that are out there  and it 's no wonder that as
  we head into the writers ' strike  odd things happen you know it reminds me of that old saw in hollywood that a
 producer is anyone who knows a writer  i now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem  but it 's not a joke this is a real headline 
 websites attract striking writers  operators of sites like 
 could benefit from labor
  you have the tv bloggers going out on strike  in sympathy with the television writers  
 and then you have tv guide a fox property  which is about to sponsor the online video awards but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television not appearing to gloat 
 to show you how schizophrenic this all is here 's the head of myspace or fox
 interactive a news corp
  i think there 's an opportunity as the strike continues there 's an opportunity for more people to experience video
 on places like myspace tv ph oh but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch man yes well first 
 you know i 'm part of news corporation as part of fox entertainment group obviously we hope that the strike is
 is that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible ph one of the great things that 's going on here
  content really is happening  here is a clip from a video 
 from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in hollywood animation worked out in israel  farmed out to croatia and india  and it 's now an international series narrator the
 following takes place between the minutes of two fifteen
  to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over voice two 
 you mean we 'll have to live here 
 together voices two three and four 
 with her voice two 
 well  there goes the neighborhood ph the company that created this  aniboom is an interesting example of where this is headed traditional tv animation costs say between eighty thousand and ten thousand dollars a minute 
 they 're producing things for between
  hundred and eight hundred dollars a minute  and they 're offering their creators thirty percent of the back end in a much more entrepreneurial manner so it 's a different model 
 what the entertainment business is struggling with the world of brands is figuring out for example nike now understands that nike plus
 is not just a device in its shoe  it 's a network to hook its
  and the head of marketing at nike says people are coming to our site an average of three times a week  we don 't have to go to them 
 which means television advertising is down fifty seven percent for nike or as nike 's
 head of marketing says we 're not in the business of keeping media companies alive we 're in the business of connecting with consumers 
 and media companies realize the audience is important also here 's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones powered one hundred percent by the user experience on the home page
 user generated content married up with traditional content it turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them or as geoffrey moore once told me  
 it 's intellectual curiosity that 's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere  and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business one of my heroes is songwriter ally willis  who just wrote the
  love to throw it back to marshall mcluhan  who forty years ago was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change  
 and i think that today traditional hollywood and the writers
  are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before but i don 't need to tell you this  let 's throw it back to him
  they think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium
 as movies tend to be the content of tv  
 and as books used to be the content novels used to be the content of movies  
 and so every time a new medium arrives the old medium is the content  and it is highly observable
  real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium and it is ignored ph i think it 's a great time of enthrallment there 's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out
 there content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth and part of social communications and i think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity
