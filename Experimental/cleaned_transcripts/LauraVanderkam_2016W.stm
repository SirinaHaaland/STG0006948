  when people find out i write about time management they assume two things one
 is that i 'm always on time and i 'm not
  i have four small children and i would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness  but sometimes it 's just not their fault  
 i was once late to my own speech on time management 
 we all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony 
 the second thing they assume is that i have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there sometimes i 'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines generally on
  how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day and the idea is that we 'll shave bits of time off everyday activities add it up and we 'll have time for the good stuff 
 i question the entire premise of this piece  but i 'm always interested in hearing what they 've come up with before they call me some of my favorites 
 doing errands where you only have to make right hand turns 
 being extremely judicious in microwave usage it says three to three and a half minutes on the package we 're totally getting in on the bottom side of that and my personal favorite which makes sense
  on some level is to dvr your favorite shows so you can fast forward through the commercials  that way you save eight minutes every half hour  so in the course of two hours of watching tv you find thirty two minutes to exercise 
 which is true  you know another way to find thirty two minutes to exercise  don 't watch two hours of tv a day right 
  the idea is we 'll save bits of time here and there add it up we will finally get to everything we want to do but after studying how successful people spend their time
 and looking at their schedules hour by hour  i think this idea has it completely backward 
 we don 't build the lives we want by saving time we build the lives we want and then time saves
  here 's what i mean i recently did a time diary project looking at one thousand and one days in the lives of extremely busy women 
 they had demanding jobs sometimes their own businesses kids to care for maybe parents to care for community commitments busy busy people 
 i had them keep track of their time for a week so i could add up how much they worked and slept  and i interviewed them about their strategies for my book 
 one of the women whose time log i studied goes out on a wednesday night for something she comes home to find
  that her water heater has broken and there is now water all over her basement 
 if you 've ever had anything like this happen to you you know it is a hugely damaging frightening sopping mess 
 so she 's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night next day she 's got plumbers coming in day after that professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet 
 all this is being recorded on her time log
  winds up taking seven hours of her week 
 seven hours 
 that 's like finding an extra hour in the day  
 but i 'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon 
 could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people i 'm sure she would 've said what most of us would 've said which is no
 can 't you see how busy i am yet when she had to find seven
  hours because there is water all over her basement 
 she found seven hours and what this shows us is that time is highly elastic  
 we cannot make more time  
 but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it  and so the key to time management
 is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken
  water heater
 to get at this i like to use language from one of the busiest people i ever interviewed 
 by busy i mean she was running a small business with twelve people on the payroll she had six children in her spare time  
 i was getting in touch with her to set up an interview on how she had it all that phrase  
 i remember it was a thursday morning and she was not available to speak with me of course right 
 but the reason she was unavailable to speak with me
  is that she was out for a hike  
 because it was a beautiful spring morning  and she wanted to go for a hike  
 so of course this makes me even more intrigued  and when i finally do catch up with her she explains it like this she says listen laura 
 everything i do 
 every minute i spend is my choice and rather than say i don 't have time to do x y or z
  because it 's not a priority i don 't have time often means it 's not a priority 
 if you think about it that 's really more accurate language i could tell you i don 't have time to dust my blinds but that 's not true  if you offered to pay me $ one hundred thousand to dust my blinds i would get to it pretty quickly 
 since that is not going to happen i can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time
  that i don 't want to do it  
 using this language reminds us that time is a choice  and granted there may be horrible consequences for making different choices i will give you that 
 but we are smart people and certainly over the long run we have the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be there  
 so how do we do that how do we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken
  water heater  
 well first we need to figure out what they are 
 i want to give you two strategies for thinking about this the first on the professional side i 'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting annual performance reviews  you look back over your successes over the year your opportunities for growth 
 and this serves its purpose
 but i find it 's more effective to do this looking forward so i want you to pretend it 's the end of next
  year you 're giving yourself a performance review and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally 
 what three to five things did you do
 that made it so
 amazing so you can write next year 's performance review
 now  and you can do this for your personal life too i 'm sure many of you like me come december get cards that
  contain these folded up sheets of colored paper on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter 
 bit of a wretched genre of literature really going on about how amazing everyone in the household is or even more scintillating how busy everyone in the household is 
 but these letters serve a purpose which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your personal life that mattered to you
  over the year  so this year 's kind of done but i want you to pretend it 's the end of next year  and it has been an absolutely amazing year
 for you and the people you care about what three to five things did you do that made it so
 amazing so you can write next year 's family holiday letter now don 't send it
  please don 't send it but you can write it  and now between the performance review
 and the family holiday letter  we have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year  
 and now we need to break these down into doable steps so maybe you want to write a family history first you can read some other family histories get a sense for the style 
  maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives set up appointments to interview them 
 or maybe you want to run a 5k so you need to find a race and sign up figure out a training plan and dig those shoes out of the back of the closet  and then this is key
 we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater by putting them into our schedules first 
 we do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them i find a really good time to do this is friday afternoons
 friday afternoon is what an economist might call a low opportunity cost time  
 most of us are not sitting there on friday afternoons saying i am excited to make progress toward my personal and professional priorities right now 
 laughter but we are willing to think about what those should be so take a little bit of time
  reminds us that there should be something in all three categories career we think about relationships  self not so much 
 but anyway just a short list two to three items in each  then look out over the whole of the next week
  and see where you can plan them in 
 where you plan them in is up to you i know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others i mean some people 's lives are just harder than others 
 it is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own 
 i get that and i don 't want to minimize anyone 's struggle  but i do think that the numbers i am about to tell
  is one hundred and sixty eight hours that
 is a lot of time  if you are working a full time job so forty hours a week  sleeping eight hours a night so fifty six hours a week
 that leaves seventy two hours for other
  is a lot of time  
 you say you 're working fifty hours a week maybe a main job and a side hustle  well that leaves sixty two hours for other things  you say you 're working sixty hours  well that leaves fifty two hours for 
  other things  you say you 're working more than sixty hours well are you sure 
 there was once a study comparing people 's estimated work weeks with time diaries they found that people
  you can guess in which direction right  
 anyway in one hundred and sixty eight hours a week i think we can find time for what matters to you 
 if you want to spend more time with your kids you want to study more for a test you 're taking you want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two you can and that 's even if you 're working
  we have plenty of time which is great because guess what we don 't even need that much time to do amazing things  but when most of us have bits of time what do we do 
 pull out the phone right  start deleting emails otherwise we 're puttering around the house or watching tv  
 but small moments can have great power 
 you can use your bits of time
 for bits of joy
  maybe it 's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus on the way to work 
 i know when i had a job that required two bus rides and a subway ride every morning i used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read it made the whole experience almost  
 almost  enjoyable  
 breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying if family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule maybe family breakfast could
  be a good substitute it 's about looking at the whole of one 's time
 and seeing where the good stuff can go 
 i truly believe this there is time  
 even if we are busy  
 we have time for what matters  and when we focus on what matters we can build the lives we want
 in the time we 've got
