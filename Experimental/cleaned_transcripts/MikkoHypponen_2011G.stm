  it 's true  think about everything it has brought us  think about all the services we use all the connectivity all the
  and it 's happening
 during our lifetimes i 'm pretty sure that one day we 'll be
 writing history books hundreds of years from now  this time our generation will be remembered
 as the generation that got online the generation that built something really and truly global
  it 's also true that the internet has problems very serious problems problems with security
 and problems with privacy  i 've spent my career
 fighting these problems  so let me show you something 
 this here is
  's the first virus we ever found for pc computers  
 and we actually know where brain came from  we know
 because it says so inside the code  
 let 's take a look 
 all right
  that 's the boot sector of an infected floppy  and if we take a closer look inside we 'll see that right there it says welcome to the dungeon 
 and then it continues saying one thousand nine hundred and eighty six basit and amjad  and basit and amjad are first
  years ago the pc virus problem is twenty five years old now  so half a year ago  i decided to go to pakistan
  couple of photos i took while i was in pakistan  this is from the city of lahore which is around three hundred kilometers south from abbottabad where bin laden was caught here 's a typical street 
 view  and here 's the street or road leading to this building which is seven hundred and thirty nizam block at allama iqbal town  
 you want to guess who opened the door  basit and amjad  they are still there
 so here standing up is basit 
 sitting down is his brother amjad these are the guys who wrote the first pc virus now
 of course  we had a very interesting discussion  i asked them why  i asked them how they
 feel about what they started  and
 i got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both basit and amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years so there is
 there is some sort of justice in the world after all 
 now the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and
  are not a problem any more  
 so let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like what i 'm running here is a system that enables me to run age old programs on a modern computer  
 so let me just
 mount some drives go over there what we have here is a list of old viruses  so let me just run some viruses on my computer for example  
 let 's go with the centipede virus first and you can see at the top of the screen there 's a centipede
 scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one you know that you 're infected because it actually shows up 
 here 's another one this is the virus called crash invented in russia in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two 
 let me show you one which actually makes some sound 
 and the last example  guess what the walker virus
  does  yes there 's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected 
 so it used to be fairly easy to know that you 're infected by a virus 
 when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers  
 today  they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers  
  viruses are a global problem 
 what we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs where we track virus infections worldwide so we can actually see in real time that we 've just blocked viruses in sweden and taiwan and
 russia and elsewhere in fact if i just connect back to our lab systems
 through the web we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses how many new examples of malware we find every single day here 's
  the latest virus we 've found in a file called 
  and we found it
 right over here three seconds ago the previous one six seconds ago  and if we just scroll around  
 it 's just massive we find tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands  and that 's the last twenty minutes of malware every single day
  so where
 are all these coming from then 
 well today  it 's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses  it 's gangs like
 let 's go to 
 this is a website operating in moscow where these guys are buying infected computers  so if you are a virus writer and you 're capable of infecting windows computers but you don 't know what to do with them
 you can sell those infected computers somebody else 's computers to these guys and they 'll actually pay you money for those computers  
 so how do these guys then monetize those infected computers  
 well there 's multiple different ways such as banking trojans  which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking 
 or keyloggers 
 keyloggers
 silently sit on your computer  hidden from view  and they record everything you type  so you 're sitting on your computer and
 you 're doing google searches every single google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals 
 every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals same thing with every single password and so on
  but the thing that they 're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store 
 because when you do purchases in online stores you will be typing in your name the delivery address your credit card number and the credit card security codes and here 's an example of a file 
  we found from a server a couple of weeks ago  that 's the credit card number that 's the expiration date that 's the security code and that 's the name of the
  once you gain access to other people 's credit card information you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information  
 and that obviously is a problem  we now have a whole underground marketplace and
 business ecosystem built around online crime one example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing
  go and have a look at the pages of interpol and search for wanted persons we find guys like bjorn sundin originally from sweden and his partner in crime also 
  listed on the interpol wanted pages mr shaileshkumar jain a u s citizen 
  couple of weeks ago froze a swiss bank account belonging to mr jain  and that bank account had fourteen point nine million u s dollars on it 
 so the amount of money online crime generates is significant and that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks 
  we know that online criminals are hiring programmers hiring testing people testing their code having
 back end systems with sql databases  and they can afford to watch how we work like how security people work and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build 
 they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage i mean the internet
 is international that 's why we call it the internet  and if you just go and take a look at what 's happening
  the online world 
 here 's a video built by clarified networks which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world  this operation believed to be originally from estonia  moves 
  around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down so you just can 't shut these guys down they will switch from one country to another from one jurisdiction to another moving around the world  using the fact that we don 't have the capability
  to globally police operations like this 
 so the internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world now criminals who weren 't capable of reaching us before can reach us  
 so how do you actually go around finding online criminals how do you actually track them down 
 let me give you an example  what we have here
 is one exploit file
 here i 'm looking at the hex dump of an image file  which contains an exploit and that basically means if you 're trying to view this image file on your windows computer it actually takes over your computer and runs code now if
 you 'll take a look at this image file well there 's the image header and there the actual code of the attack
  and that code has been encrypted so let 's decrypt it it has been encrypted with
 xor function ninety seven you just have to believe me it is it is and
 we can go here and actually start decrypting it 
 well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted and i know it doesn 't really look much different from the original but just keep staring at it you 'll actually see that down here you can see a web
  and when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program and that 's a backdoor which will take over your computer  
 but even more interestingly if we continue decrypting we 'll find this mysterious string which says
  anything and i was looking at that trying to figure out what it means  
 so obviously i googled for it i got zero hits  wasn 't there  
 so i spoke with the guys at the lab and we have a couple of russian guys in our labs and one of them mentioned well it ends in rus like russia and 
 is the city code for the city of st petersburg  for example you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that so i
  looking for contacts in st petersburg  
 and through a long road we eventually found this one particular website 
 here 's this russian guy who 's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website and he runs a blog under the popular live journal and on this blog he blogs about his life about his life in
  engine with more than four hundred horsepower  now that 's a nice car for a 20 something year old kid in st petersburg how do i know about this car
  because he blogged about the car 
 he actually had a car accident in downtown  st petersburg he actually crashed his car into another car  and he put blogged images about the car accident that 's his mercedes
 right here is the lada samara he crashed into and you can actually see that the license plate of the samara ends in 
 and if you actually take a look at the scene picture you can see that
  i 'm not a lawyer  but if i would be this is where i would say i rest my case 
 so what happens when online criminals are caught  well in most cases it never gets this far the vast majority of the online crime cases we don 't even know
  which continent the attacks are coming from and even if we are able to find online criminals quite often there is no outcome the local police don 't act or if they do there 's not enough evidence or for some reason we can 't take them down  i wish it would be easier  
 unfortunately it isn 't 
 but things are also changing
 at a very rapid pace  you 've all heard about things like stuxnet  
  if you look at what stuxnet did is that it infected these that 's a siemens
  plc programmable logic [ controller ] and this
 is what runs our infrastructure  this is what runs everything around us  plc 's these small boxes which have no display no keyboard which are programmed 
 are put in place and they do their job for example the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these 
  stuxnet infects one of these that 's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about because everything around us is being run by these i 
  mean we have critical infrastructure you go to any any factory any power plant  any chemical plant any food processing plant you look around everything
  on these computers working we have become very reliant
 on
 internet on basic things like electricity  obviously 
 on computers working  and this really is something which creates completely new problems for us  
 we must have some way of continuing to work even if computers
  so preparedness means that we can do stuff even
  when the things we take for granted
 aren 't there it 's actually very basic stuff thinking about continuity  thinking about backups  thinking about the things that actually matter 
 now i told you 
 i love the internet i do think about all the services we have online
 think about if they are taken away from you if one day you don 't actually have them for some reason or another
  i see beauty in the future of the internet  but i 'm worried
 that we might not see that 
 i 'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us 
 laughter i 've spent my life
  and i do feel
 that if we don 't fight online crime we are
 running a risk of losing it all we have to do this globally  and we have to do it right now what we need
 is more global international law enforcement work
 to find online criminal gangs these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks  that 's much more important than running
 anti viruses or running firewalls what actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks  and even more importantly we have to find the people who
 are about to become part of this online world of crime but haven 't yet done it we have to find the people with the skills  but without the opportunities
  give them the opportunities to use their skills for good
