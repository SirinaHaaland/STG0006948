  actually began when i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah georgia
 and this was the 1960s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals 
  we lived on robert e lee boulevard  
 and when i was five my parents gave me an orange schwinn sting ray bicycle it had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars
 that made the rider look like an orangutan that 's why they were called ape hangers they were actually modeled on
 on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s which i 'm sure my mom didn 't know and one day i was exploring
 this cul de sac hidden away a few streets away and i came back and i wanted to
 turn around and get back to that street more
  quickly  so i decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood and wham  i was hit by a passing sedan  
 my mangled body flew in one direction  my mangled bike flew in the other  
 and i lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line and one of my neighbors came running over andy andy how are you doing she said  using the name of my older brother
  passed out 
 i broke my left femur that day it 's the largest bone in your body and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to 
  my right knee and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle 
 walking i traveled around the world entered different cultures  wrote a series of books about my travels including walking the bible i hosted a television show by that name on pbs i was for all the world the walking guy 
 until in may two thousand and eight a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number
 that something might
  be wrong with my bones  
 and my doctor on a whim sent me to get a full body bone scan which showed that there was some growth in my left leg that sent me to an x ray then to an mri  
 and one afternoon i got a call from my doctor 
 the tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor 
 i stopped walking and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more
  horrifying negative  i have cancer  
 and to think that the tumor was in the same bone in the same place in my body as the accident thirty eight years earlier it seemed like too much of a coincidence  
 so that afternoon i went back to my house and my three year old identical twin daughters eden and tybee feiler came running to meet me they
 'd just turned three and they were into all things pink and purple
  fact we called them pinkalicious and purplicious
 although i must say our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday april 15th when they were born at six fourteen and six forty six on april fifteen two thousand and five 
 our otherwise grim  humorless doctor looked at his watch
  so they had just turned three and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground  laughing with all the glee in the world 
 i crumbled  
 i kept imagining all the walks i might not take with them the art projects i might not mess up the boyfriends i might not scowl
  at the aisles i might not walk down 
 would they wonder who i was i thought would they yearn for my approval  my love my voice 
 a few days later i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice  i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life
 and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters ' lives i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities
  in their lives i wrote these men they 'll have loving families and welcoming homes  but they may not have me  they may not have their dad 
 will you help be their dad 
 and i said to myself i would call this group of men the council of dads 
 now as soon as i had this idea i decided i wouldn 't tell my wife
  there 's this idea in this culture i don 't have to tell you that you sort of happy your way through a problem we should focus on the positive my wife as i said she grew up outside of boston she 's got a big smile she 's got a big personality she 's got big hair
 although  she told me recently i can 't say she has big hair because if i say she has big hair people will think she 's from texas  
 and it 's apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia but not to have hair from texas
  and actually in her defense if she were here right now she would point out that when we got married in georgia 
 there were three questions on the marriage certificate license  the third of which was are you related 
 i said look in georgia at least we want to know in arkansas they don 't even ask 
 what i didn 't tell her is if she said yes you could jump you don 't need the 30 day waiting period because
 don 't need the get to know you session at that point  
 so i wasn 't going to tell her about this idea but the next day i couldn 't control myself i told her and she loved the idea  but she quickly started rejecting my nominees
 she was like well i love him but i would never ask him for advice so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really
  so we decided that we needed a set of rules and we came up with a number and the first one was no family only friends  we thought our family would already be there 
 second men only we were trying to fill the dad space in the girls ' lives  
 and then third sort of a dad for every side we kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing 
 so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men and rather than send it i decided to read it to them in person linda my wife
  it was like having six different marriage proposals i sort of friend married each of these guys  
 and the first of these guys was jeff schumlin now jeff led this trip i took to europe when i graduated from high school
 in the early 1980s and on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle and i snuck out behind  and there was a moat a fence and a field of cows
  cows sleep standing up so if you approach them from behind  down wind you can push them over and they go thud in the mud 
 so before i had a chance to determine whether this was right or not we had jumped the moat we had climbed the fence we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor  dozing cow 
 so a few weeks after my diagnosis we went up to vermont  and i decided to put jeff as the first person
  in the council of dads and we went to this apple orchard and i read him this letter will you help be their dad 
 and i got to the end he was crying and i was crying and then he looked at me and he said yes i was like 
 yes i kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter and frankly although
 i keep getting asked this it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances 
 and then i asked him a question which i ended up asking to all the dads and
  ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book and that was what 's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls 
 and jeff 's advice was be a traveller not a tourist 
 get off the bus  seek out what 's different approach the cow 
 so it 's ten years from now i said and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad  and i 'm not
  i would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle you can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe
 run your finger and make a small ripple or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like what it smells like and
 as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland the glint that says let 's go cow tipping even though
 we never did tip the cow  even though no one tips the cow  even though cows
  don 't sleep standing up he said i want to see you back here girls at the end of this experience  covered in mud 
 two weeks after my diagnosis a biopsy confirmed i had a seven inch osteosarcoma in my left femur 
 six hundred americans a year get an osteosarcoma eighty five percent
  only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases  twenty years ago  doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped  and there was a fifteen percent survival rate 
 and then in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective and within weeks i had started that regimen 
 and since we are in a medical room i went through four and a half months of chemo actually i had cisplatin doxorubicin and
  surgery in which my surgeon dr john healey at memorial sloan kettering hospital in new york took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium 
 and if you did see the sanjay special you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my
 into my pelvis then he took my fibula from my calf cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh where it now lives  and what he actually did was he
 from my calf and re vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip  
 and then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle 
 this is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me 
 and my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo it was as we said in my house a lost year
  because in those opening weeks we all had nightmares and one night i had a nightmare that i was walking through my house  sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else 's children sitting on my desk 
 and i remember a particular one night that when you told that story of  i don 't know where you are dr nuland of of william sloane coffin it made me think of it 
 because i was in the hospital
  i think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero and i had basically no immune system  and they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body 
 and one night i got a call from my mother in law that my daughters at that time three and a half were missing me and feeling my absence  
 and i hung up the phone  and i put my face in my hands  and i screamed this silent scream
  and what you said dr nuland i don 't know where you are
 made me think of this today because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that i had was like a primal scream
  and what was so striking and one one of the messages i want to leave you here with today is the experience as i became less and less human and at this moment in my life i was probably thirty pounds less than i am right now of course i had no hair
 and no immune system they were actually
 putting blood inside my body at that moment i was less and less human i was also at the same time maybe the most human i 've ever been  
 and what was so striking about that time was instead of repulsing people  i was actually proving to be a magnet for people people were incredibly drawn
  my wife and i had kids we thought it would be all hands on deck instead it was everybody running the other way  
 and when i had cancer we thought it 'd be everybody running the other way  instead it was all hands on deck 
 and when people came to me  rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw i was like a living ghost they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives  
 cancer i found is a passport to intimacy  it is an invitation
  maybe even a mandate to enter the most vital arenas of human life the most sensitive and the most frightening the ones that we never want to go to 
 but when we do go there we feel incredibly transformed when we do  
 and this also happened to my girls
 as they began to see and we thought maybe became an ounce more compassionate one day my daughter
 tybee tybee came to me and she said i have so much love for you in my body daddy i can 't stop giving you hugs and kisses  and when i have no more love left i just drink milk  because that 's where
  love comes from 
 and one night my daughter eden came to me and as i lifted my leg out of bed  she reached for my crutches and handed them to me in fact 
 if i cling to one memory of this year it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers
 grasping the handle underneath my hand i didn 't need the crutch anymore  i was walking on air and
 one of the profound things
  that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people  and it made me think and i 'll just note for the record one word that i 've only heard once actually was when we were all doing tony robbins yoga yesterday
 the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word friend 
 and yet from everything we 've been talking about compliance or addiction or weight loss we now know that community is important and yet it 's one thing we don 't actually bring in 
 and there was something incredibly profound
  sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me  
 and one of the things that i learned is that over time particularly men who used to be non communicative are becoming more and more communicative  
 and that particularly happened there was one in my life is this is this council of dads that linda said what we were talking about it 's like   what the moms talk about at school drop off 
 and no one captures this modern manhood to me more than david black now david is my
 literary agent he 's about five foot three and a half on a good day standing fully upright in cowboy boots  
 and on kind of the manly male front he answers the phone i can say this i guess because you 've done it here he answers the phone yo motherfucker 
 he gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car
 although like a lot of men he 's impatient he bought it on his 49th but like a lot of modern men he hugs he
  bakes he leaves work early to coach little league someone asked me if he cried when i asked him to be in the council of dads i was like david cries when you invite him to take a walk 
 but he 's a literary agent which means he 's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don 't come true  and this is what we wanted him to capture
 what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations and i said what 's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer and he said a belief in themselves
  but when i came to see you i said i didn 't believe in myself i was at a wall 
 he said i don 't see the wall and i 'm telling you the same don 't see the wall  
 you may encounter one from time to time but you 've got to find a way to get over it around it or through it but whatever you do don 't succumb to it don 't give in to the wall  
 my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge  and during the year and a half i was on crutches  it became a sort
  symbol to me  so one day near the end of my journey i said come on girls let 's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge 
 we set out on crutches i was on crutches my wife was next to me my girls were doing these
 rockstar poses up ahead 
 and because walking was one of the first things i lost i spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts 
 walking upright we are told is the threshold of what made us human
  and yet for the four million years humans have been walking upright  the act is essentially unchanged 
 as my physical therapist likes to say every step is a tragedy waiting to happen you nearly fall with one leg then you catch yourself with the other 
 and the biggest consequence of walking on crutches as i did for a year and a half
 is that you walk
  you get where you 're going  but you get there alone you go slow you get where you 're going  but you get there with this community you built along the way 
 at the risk of admission i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches  
 two hundred years ago a
 new type of pedestrian appeared in paris he was called a flaneur one who wanders the arcades  
  and it was the custom custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks
 and letting the reptile set the pace  
 and i just love this ode to slow moving and it 's become my own motto for my girls take a walk with a turtle
  behold the world in pause  
 and this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson i took from my journey 
 there 's a quote from moses on the side of the liberty bell  and it comes from a passage in the book
  leviticus that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow  and every seven sets of seven years the land gets an extra year of rest
 during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love 
 that 50th year is called the jubilee year and it 's the origin of that term 
  i 'm shy of fifty it captures my own experience  my lost year was my jubilee year by laying fallow  i planted the seeds for a healthier future
 and was reunited with the ones i love come the one year anniversary of my journey i went to see my surgeon dr john healey
 and by the way healey  great name for a doctor he 's the president of the international society of limb salvage which is the least
  euphemistic term i 've ever heard  and i said dr healey if my daughters come to you one day and say ' what should i learn
 from my daddy 's story ' what would you tell them he said i would tell them what i know  and that is
 everybody dies  but not everybody lives  i want you to live 
 i wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book the council of dads and i listed these lessons a few of which you 've heard here today approach the cow  pack your
  flipflops don 't see the wall  live the questions  harvest miracles 
 as i looked at this list to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living i realized  we may have done it for our girls  but it really changed us  
 and that is the secret of the council of dads is that my wife and i did this in an attempt to help
  but it really changed us  so i stand here today
 as you see now walking without crutches or a cane 
 and last week i had my 18 month scans  
 and as you all know anybody with cancer has to get follow up scans in my case it 's quarterly  
 and all the collective minds in this room i dare say can never find a solution for scan xiety 
 as i was going there i was wondering what would i say depending on what happened here 
 i got good news that day
  and i stand here today cancer free walking without aid without aid and hobbling forward  
 and i just want to mention briefly in passing i 'm past my time limit but i just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is at a similar meeting 
 back in the spring  
 anne wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly in a span of three weeks
 put the full resources of
  and we announced an initiative in july to get to decode the genome of
 anybody a living person with a heart tissue bone sarcoma  
 and she told me last night in the three months since we 've done it we 've gotten three hundred people who 've contributed to this program 
 and the epidemiologists here will tell you that 's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the united states  
 so if you go to 23andme or if you go to
  you can click on a link  and we encourage anybody to join this effort  
 but i 'll just close what i 've
 been talking about by leaving you with this message may you find an excuse to reach out to some long lost pal or to that college roommate  or to some person you may have turned away from 
 may you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace  or find a way to get over
  or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams  
 and every now and then find a friend find a turtle  and take a long slow
