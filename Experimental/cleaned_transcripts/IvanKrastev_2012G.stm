  i 'm afraid i 'm one of those speakers
 you hope you 're not going to meet at ted first i don 't have a mobile so
 i 'm on the safe side secondly a political theorist who 's going to talk about the crisis of democracy
 is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about
 and plus i 'm not going to give you any answers  i 'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we 're talking about and one of the things that i want to question is
 this very popular hope these days that transparency and openness
 can restore the trust in democratic institutions  
 there is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me you people the church of ted are a very optimistic community
 basically you believe in complexity  but not in ambiguity  
 as you have been told i 'm bulgarian and according to the surveys we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world 
 the economist magazine recently wrote an article covering one of the recent studies on happiness  and the title was
 the happy  the unhappy and the bulgarians so
 now when you know what to expect 
 let 's give you the story  and this is a rainy election day
 in a small country
 that can be my country but could be also your country  and because of the rain until four o 'clock in the afternoon nobody went to the polling stations
  but then the rain stopped people went to vote and when the votes had been counted three fourths
 of the people
 have voted with a blank ballot the government and the opposition they have been simply
 paralyzed  because you know what to do about the protests you know who to arrest who to negotiate with but what to
  do about people who are voting
 with a blank ballot so the government decided
 to have the elections once again  and this time even a greater number
 eighty three percent of the people  voted with blank ballots basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell
 that they have nobody to vote for this is the opening of a beautiful novel
 by jose saramago called seeing but in my view it very well captures
 part of the problem that we have with democracy in europe these days on one level nobody 's questioning
 that democracy is the best form of government 
 democracy is the only game in town  the problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing
  for the last thirty years political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline
 in electoral turnout  
 and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting  i mean the unemployed 
 this is a major issue  because especially now with the economic crisis
 you can see that the trust in politics that the trust in democratic institutions 
 was really destroyed according to the latest survey being done by the european commission eighty nine percent of the citizens of europe believe
 that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the 
 and the opinion of the public only eighteen percent of italians and fifteen percent
  of greeks believe that their vote matters basically people start to understand
 that they can change governments but they cannot change policies  and the question which i want to ask is the following  how did it happen
 that we are living in societies which are much freer than ever before we have more
  we can travel easier we have access to more information at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions basically has collapsed  
 so basically i want to ask 
 what went right and what went wrong
 in these fifty years when we talk about democracy and i 'll start with what went right and the first thing that went right
 was of course these five revolutions which in my view very much
  we 're living and deepened our democratic experience  and the first was the cultural and social revolution 
 and sixty eight and 1970s which put the individual at the center of politics it was the human rights moment 
 basically this was also a major outbreak a culture of dissent a culture of
 basically
  which was not known before  
 so i do believe that even things like that are very much the children of ' sixty eight nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then 
 but after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it the truth is
 that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message the government does not know better
  the end of communism  the end of the cold war and it was the birth of the global world and you have
 the internet  
 and this is not the audience to which i 'm going to preach to what extent the internet empowered people it
 has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics the very idea of political
  and i 'm going to name one more revolution and this is the revolution in brain sciences 
 which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions  so this is
 what went right  but if we 're going to see what went wrong we 're going to end up with the same five revolutions
  because first you have the 1960s and 1970s cultural and social
  which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose 
 the very idea all these collective nouns that we have been taught about nation  class  family we start to like divorcing if we 're married at all 
 all this was very much
 under attack  and it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where
  and you have
 the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies  remember
 the spread of democracy has always been accompanied
 by the decline of inequality  the more democratic our societies have been the more
  they have been becoming now we have the reverse tendency  the spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality  
 and i find this very much disturbing when we 're talking about
 what 's going on right and wrong with democracy these days 
 and if you go to one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine something that basically you don 't expect that anybody 's going to criticize but many are going to tell
  it was the end of the cold war
 that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in western europe when the soviet union was still there  
 the rich and the powerful  they needed the people  because they feared them 
 now the elites basically have been liberated they
 're very mobile you cannot tax them and basically they don 't fear the people  so as a result of it you have this
  very strange situation
 in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters so this is not by accident
 that the voters are not interested to vote anymore  and when we talk about the internet  yes it 's true the internet connected all of us but we also know
 that the internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to and it 's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are
  not like you i know that many people here have been splendidly speaking about
 the digital world and the possibility for cooperation  but [ have you ] seen what the digital world has done to american politics these days  
 this is also partly a result of the internet revolution this is the other side of the things that we like  and when you go to the brain sciences
  what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is
 don 't talk to me about ideas anymore don 't talk to me about policy programs what really matters is
 basically to manipulate the emotions of the people 
 and you have this very strongly to the extent that even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days these revolutions are not
  named anymore
 around ideologies or ideas before revolutions used to have ideological names they could be communist they could be liberal they could be fascist or islamic now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used 
 you have facebook revolutions  twitter revolutions  the content doesn 't matter anymore  
 the problem is the media i 'm saying this because one of my major points is
 what went right
 is also what went wrong  and when we 're now
  trying to see how we can change the situation when basically we 're trying to see what can be done about democracy we should keep this ambiguity in mind  
 because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most 
 these days it 's very
 popular to believe that this push for transparency  this kind of a combination between active citizens
 new technologies and much more 
  legislation can restore
 trust in politics you believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie 
 it 's going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill 
 this is probably true  but i do believe that we
  should be also very clear
 that now when we put the transparency
 at the center of politics where the message is it 's transparency stupid 
 transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions  transparency is politics ' management of mistrust 
 we are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust  and by the way mistrust was always
  very important for democracy this is why you have checks and balances this is why basically you have
 all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent  but when politics is only
 management of mistrust then i 'm very glad that
  going to be we being the big brother watching the political class  but is this the idea of a free society for example can you imagine
 that decent  civic  talented people are going to run for office
 if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust 
  are you not afraid with all these technologies
 that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues 
 are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat
 their positions  even the very wrong positions  because consistency is going to be more important than common sense and the americans who are in the room are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern on the basis of what they said in the primary elections
  i find this extremely important because democracy is about people changing their views
 based on rational arguments and discussions and we can lose this with the very noble idea
 to keep people accountable for showing the people that we 're not going to tolerate politicians the opportunism in politics  
 so for me this is extremely important and i do believe that when we 're discussing
 politics these days probably it makes sense
 to look also at this type of a story 
 but also don 't forget any unveiling is also veiling [ regardless of
 ] how transparent our governments want to be they 're going to be selectively transparent 
 in a small country that could be my country but could be also your country  they took a decision it is a real case story
 that all of the governmental decisions
  of the council of ministers were going to be published
 on the internet twenty four hours
 after the council discussions took place and the public was extremely all for it 
 so i had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister why he made this decision he said listen  this is the best way to keep the mouths of my ministers closed  
 because it 's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing
  that twenty four hours after this is going to be on the public space  
 and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis so when we talk about transparency when we talk about openness i really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong  
 and this is goethe who is neither bulgarian nor a political scientist some centuries ago he said 
 there is a big shadow where there is much light thank you very much
