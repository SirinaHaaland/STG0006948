  what i want to try to do is tell a quick story about a four hundred and four page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it 
 but to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a four hundred and four page actually is
  four page
 is that it 's that broken experience on the web it 's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can 't find it and 
  it serves you the four hundred and four page it 's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it  and i just want you to think a little bit about remember for yourself it 's annoying
  four hundred and four come from it 's from a family of errors actually a whole set of relationship errors which when i started digging into them it looks almost like a checklist for
 a sex therapist or a couples counselor you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey
  sites small this is a a global experience 
 what a four hundred and four page tells you is that you fell through the cracks and
 that 's not a good experience when you 're used to experiences like this you can get on your kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone a four hundred and four page is not what you 're looking for you get that
  it 's like a slap in the face trying to think about how a four hundred and four felt and it would be like if you if you went to starbucks and there 's the guy behind the counter and you 're over there and there 's no skim milk  and you say hey could you bring the skim milk and they walk out from behind the counter and they 've got no pants on
  into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incubator and we had eight startups sitting around there and those startups are focused on what they are not what they 're not until one day athletepath which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes found this video
  they took that video and they embedded it in their four hundred and four page and it was it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place  because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a four hundred and four 
 so this turned into a contest
  dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their four hundred and four page stayhound which helps you find pet sitters through your social network  commiserated with your pet
 each one of them found this it turned into a 24 hour contest at four four the next day we gave out $ four hundred and four in cash and what they learned was that those little things done right actually matter  and that well designed moments can build brands  
 this is one that commiserates with you this is one that blames you this is one that i loved 
  this is an error page  but what if this error page was also an opportunity  so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got 
  really excited about what they could be because back to the whole relationship issue what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you 're not
