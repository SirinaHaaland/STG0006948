  what i 'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of india 's maybe the world 's longest running soap opera 
 which is cricket and may it run forever because it gives people like me a living  
 it 's got everything that you 'd want a normal soap opera to want it 's got love
  joy happiness sadness tears laughter  lots of deceit intrigue and like all good soaps it jumps twenty years when the audience interest changes  
 and that 's exactly what cricket has done  it 's jumped twenty years into 20 over game  
 and that 's what i 'm going to talk about how a small change leads to a
  like that cricket wasn 't always this
 speed driven generations game  there was a time when you played cricket you played timeless test matches when you played on till the game got over  
 and there was this game in march one thousand nine 
  that started on the third of march and ended on the 14th of march and it only ended because the english cricketers had to
  go from durban to cape town which is a two hour train journey to catch the ship that left on the 17th because the next ship wasn 't around for a long time 
 so the match was ended in between  and one of the english batsmen said you know what another half an hour and we would have won 
 another half an hour after twelve days there were two sundays in between but of course  sundays are church days  so you don 't play on
  and one day it rained so they all sat around making friends with each other but there is a reason why india fell in love with cricket because we had about the same pace of life 
 the mahabharata was like that as well wasn 't it you fought by day 
 then it was sunset  so everyone went back home  
 and then you worked out your strategy and you came and fought the next day and you went back home again 
 the only difference between the mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket everybody was alive to come back and fight the next
  day  princes patronize the game  not because they love the game  but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the british rulers but
 there is one other reason why india fell in love with cricket  which was all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball and any number of people could play it anywhere  
 take a look  
 you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there you could play it in a little alley you
  't hit square anywhere because the bat hit the wall don 't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires you could play it on the banks of the ganges that 's as clean as the ganges has been for a long time  
 or you could play many games in one small patch of land even if you didn 't know which game you were actually in 
 as you can see you can play anywhere  but slowly
  you don 't always have five days so we moved on and we started playing 50 over cricket  and then
 an enormous accident took place in indian sport we don 't make things happen accidents happen and we 're in the right place at the right time sometimes  
 and we won this world cup in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three 
 and suddenly we fell in love with the 50 over game  and we played it virtually every day  there was more 50 over cricket than anywhere
  we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at india  rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country  
 and so we allowed multinationals into india we cut customs duties we reduced import duties  and we got all the multinationals coming in with multinational budgets who looked at
  income and got very excited about the possibilities in india and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian and there are only two vehicles in india one real one scripted 
 the scripted one is what you see in the movies the real one was cricket  and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me ravi dhariwal from pepsi decided he 's going to take it
 all over the world and pepsi was this big revolution 
 because they started taking cricket all over  and so cricket started becoming big cricket started bringing riches in television started covering cricket for a long time television said
 we won 't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it then they said ok the next rights are sold for fifty five million dollars the next rights are sold for six hundred and twelve million dollars 
 so it 's a bit of a curve that  and then another big accident happened in our cricket  
 england invented twenty overs cricket and said the world must play twenty overs cricket just as england invented cricket and made the rest of the world play it  thank god for them
  and so india had to go and play the t20 world cup you see 
 india didn 't want to play the t20 world cup but we were forced to play it by an 8 1 margin  
 and then something very dramatic happened we got to the final  and then this moment that will remain enshrined forever for everybody take a look
  suddenly india discovered this power of
 20 overs cricket the accident of course there was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast if
 he had bowled fast the ball would have gone where it was meant to go but it didn 't go and we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game  
 and what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that india could be the best in the world it was at a time when investment was coming in india was feeling a little more confident about itself  and so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can
  do and thankfully for all of us the english are very good at inventing things and then the gracious people that they are they let the world become very good at it 
 and
 so england invented t20 cricket and allowed india to hijack it it was not like reengineering that we do in medicine
  new thing for us we had only ever supported our country the only two areas in which india was very proud about
 their country representing itself on the field one was war the indian army which we don 't like to happen very often the other was indian cricket  now suddenly we had to support
 city leagues  but the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the west  america is a home of leagues
  leagues and they said right we 'll build some glitzy leagues here in india but was india ready for it because cricket for a long time in india was always organized  it was never promoted
 it was never sold it was organized  and look what they did with our beautiful  nice simple family game  all of a sudden  you had that
  an opening ceremony to match every other this was an india that was buying corvettes this was an india that was buying jaguar this was an india that was adding more mobile phones per month than new zealand 's population
  twice over 
 so it was a different india  but it was also a slightly more orthodox india that was very happy to be modern but didn 't want to say that to people  
 and so they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived everyone secretly watched them  but everyone claimed not to
  the new owners of indian cricket were not were not the old princes they were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn 't actually love it these were people who ran serious companies  
 and so they started promoting cricket big time started promoting clubs big time  and they 've started
  promoting them with huge money behind it i mean the ipl had two point three billion dollars before a ball was bowled 
 one point six billion dollars for television revenue over ten years and another seventy million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money  
 and then they had to appeal to their cities but they had to do it like the west right because we are setting up leagues  but what they were very good at doing was
 making it very localized
  just to give you an example of how they did it not manchester united style promotion but very mumbai style promotion take a look
  a lot of people said maybe they dance better than they play but that 's all right 
 what it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket all along if you wanted a young cricketer you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality your own city  
 and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers now
  all of the sudden if you were to bowl a shot if mumbai were to bowl a shot for example they needn 't
 go to kalbadevi or shivaji park or somewhere to source them they could go to trinidad 
 this was the new india wasn 't it this was the new world where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price 
 and all of a sudden indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world so the mumbai indians flew in dwayne bravo from trinidad and tobago overnight 
 and when he had to go back to represent the west indies they asked him
 when do you have to reach he said i have to be there by a certain time so i have to leave today we said no no no it 's not about when you have to leave  it 's about when do you have to reach there 
 and so he said i 've got to reach on date x and they said fine you play to date x minus one 
 so he played in hyderabad  went straight after the game  went from the stadium to hyderabad airport sat in a private corporate jet first refueling in portugal second refueling in brazil he was in west indies in time
 never would india have thought on this scale before 
 never would india have said i want a player to play one game for me  and i will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to kingston jamaica
 to play a game and i just thought to myself wow we 've arrived somewhere in the world you know
  we have arrived somewhere we are thinking big but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things
  in indian cricket which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment there is cricket and the movies and they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs  
 and so  
 people started going to the cricket to watch preity zinta 
 they started going to the cricket to watch shah rukh khan  and something very interesting happened we started getting song and dance in indian cricket  
 and so it started resembling the indian movies more and more and of course
  's team as you will see on the clip that follows if you did well you got a hug from preity zinta so that was the ultimate reason to do well take a look
 everyone 's watching preity zinta
  and then of course there was shah rukh playing the kolkata crowd we
 'd all seen matches in kolkata but we 'd never seen anything like this shah rukh with the bengali song getting the audiences all worked up for kolkata not for india  but for kolkata but take a look at this
  indian film star hugging a pakistani cricketer because they 'd won in kolkata can you imagine and do you know what the pakistani cricketer said 
 i wish i was playing for preity zinta 's team
  but i thought i 'd take this opportunity there 's a few people from pakistan in here i 'm so happy that you 're here because i think we can show that we can both be together and be friends right we can play cricket together we can be friends so thank you very much for coming all of you from pakistan 
 there was criticism
  players are being bought and sold are they grain are they cattle 
 because we had this auction you see  how do you fix a price for a player  
 and so the auction that followed literally had people saying bang so many million dollars for
  a game which earned its players fifty rupees a day so two hundred and fifty rupees for a test match but if you finish in four days you only got two hundred 
 the best indian players who played every test match every one of the internationals the top of the line
  players standard contracts are two hundred and twenty thousand dollars in a whole year now they were getting five hundred thousand for six days ' work then andrew flintoff came by from england he got one and a half million dollars and he went back and said 
 for four weeks i 'm earning more than frank lampard and steven gerrard and i 'm earning more than the footballers wow and where was he earning it from from a little club in india 
 could you have imagined that day would come 
 one and a half million dollars for six weeks ' work that 's not bad is it
 so at two point three billion dollars before the first ball was bowled what india was doing though was benchmarking itself against the best in the world  and it became a huge brand
 lalit modi was on the cover of business today  ipl became the biggest brand in india and because our elections had to be moved to south africa  and we had to start the tournament
  in three weeks  move a whole tournament to south africa in three weeks but we did it you know why  because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event and nobody works fast as we 
  do in the last three weeks 
 our population which for a for a long time we thought was a problem suddenly became our biggest asset
  more people watching the huge consuming class everybody came to watch the cricket we
 'd also made cricket the only sport in india  which is a pity  but in india every other sport pushes cricket to become big which is a bit of a tragedy of our times 
 now 
 this last minute before i go there 's a couple of side effects of all this for a long time india was this country of
 poverty dust  beggars  
  delhi belly people heard delhi belly stories before they came and all of a sudden india was this land of opportunity
 cricketers all over the world said you know we love india  we love to play in india 
 and that felt good you know  we said the dollar 's quite powerful actually 
 can you imagine you 've got the dollar on view and there 's no delhi belly in there anymore 
 there 's no filth there 's no beggars all the snake charmers have vanished everybody 's gone this tells you how the capitalist world rules
  right so  finally 
 an english game that india usurped a little bit 
 but t20 is going to be the next missionary in the world if you want to take the game around the world it 's got to be the shortest form of the game you can 't take a timeless test to china and sit through fourteen days with no result in the end or you can 't take it all over the world so that 's what t20 is doing  
 hopefully it 'll make everyone richer hopefully it 'll make the game bigger and hopefully it 'll give cricket commentators more time in the business thank you very much
