  you always think about technology the world changing becoming more innovative you think about the driverless  
 everyone 's talking about driverless cars these days and i love the concept of a driverless car but when i go in one
  it really slow  i want access to the steering wheel and the brake just in case i don
 't know about you but i am not ready for a driverless bus i am
 not ready for a driverless airplane how about a driverless world 
 and i ask you that
 because we are increasingly in one
 it 's not supposed to be that way we 're number one 
 the united states is large and in charge 
 americanization and globalization for the last several generations have basically been the same thing
  right whether it 's the world trade organization
 or it 's the imf the world bank  the bretton woods accord on currency
  these were american institutions our values  our friends our allies our money our standards 
 that was the way the world worked  
 so
 it 's sort of interesting if you want to look at how the us looks here it is this is our view of how the world is run 
 president obama has got the red carpet he goes down air force one and it feels pretty good it feels pretty comfortable well  i don 't know how many of you saw the china trip last week
 and the g20 oh my god
  right this is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world 's leaders in china the national security advisor was actually spewing expletives on the tarmac
  kind of left out the
 bottom of the plane along with all the media and everybody else
  later on in the g20 well there 's obama 
 hi george  hi norman  
 they look like they 're about to get into a cage match right and they did it was ninety minutes long
  they talked about syria that 's what putin wanted to talk about he 's increasingly calling the shots he 's the one willing to do stuff there
 there 's not a lot of mutual like or trust  
 but it 's not as if the americans are telling him what to do how about when the whole twenty are getting together surely when the leaders are all onstage 
 then the americans are pulling their weight uh oh 
  xi jinping seems fine  
 angela merkel has she always does that look she always does that
  but putin is telling turkish president erdogan what to do and obama is like what 's going on
 over there 
 you see
 and the problem is it 's not a g20 the problem is it 's a g zero
 world that we live in a world order where there is no single country or alliance
 that can meet the
  challenges of global leadership the g20 doesn 't work the 
 all of our friends that 's history  
 so globalization is continuing goods and services and people and capital are moving across borders faster and faster than ever before  but americanization is not 
 so if i 've convinced you of that i want to do two things with the rest of this talk
  i want to talk about the implications of that
 for the whole world i 'll go around it and then i want to talk about what we think right here
 in the united states and in new york  so why what are the implications why are we here well we 're here
 because
  we spent two trillion dollars on wars in iraq and afghanistan that were failed we don 't want to do that anymore 
 we have large numbers of middle and working classes that feel like they 've not benefited from promises of globalization so they don 't want to see it particularly  
 and we have an energy revolution
 where we don 't need opec or the middle east the way we used to we produce all that right here in the united states so the americans don 't want
 to be the global sheriff for security or the architect of global trade the americans don 't want to even be the cheerleader of global values well then
 you look to europe 
 and the most important alliance in the world has been the transatlantic relationship  but it is now weaker than it has been at any point since world war ii all of the crises the
  hedging going on between the french and the russians or the germans and the turks or the brits and the chinese 
 china does want to do more leadership they do but only in the economic sphere  and they want their own values standards currency  in competition with that of the us the russians want to do more leadership you see that in ukraine 
 in the baltic states in the middle east
 but not with the americans they want their own preferences and order that 's why we are where we are so what happens going forward  let 's start easy 
 with the middle east 
 laughter you know  i left a little out but you get the general idea look
  three reasons why the middle east has had stability such as it is  
 right  one is because there was a willingness to provide some level of military security by the us and allies number two it was easy 
  to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was expensive
  and number three was no matter how bad the leaders were the populations were relatively quiescent 
 they didn 't have the ability and many didn 't have the will to really rise up against well  i can tell you in a g zero world all three of those things are increasingly not 
  true and so failed states  terrorism refugees and the rest does the entire middle east fall apart no
  the kurds will do better and iraq  israel iran over time but generally speaking it 's not a good look ok how about this guy
 he 's playing a poor hand very well  there 's no question he 's hitting above his weight
  but long term i didn 't mean that  but long term long term
 if you think that the russians were antagonized by the us and europe expanding nato right up to their borders when we
  said they weren 't going to and the eu encroaching them 
 just wait until the chinese put hundreds of billions of dollars in every country around russia they thought they had influence in the chinese are going to dominate it the russians are picking up the crumbs in a g zero world this is going to be a very tense
 ten years for mr 
  it 's not all bad 
 right  asia actually looks a lot better there are real leaders across asia 
 they have a lot of political stability they 're there for a while mr modi in india
 mr abe who is probably about to get a third term written in in the liberal democratic party in japan of course xi jinping who is consolidating enormous power the most powerful leader in china
 since mao
 those are the three most important economies in asia now look there are problems in asia we see the sparring over the south china sea  we see that kim jong un just in the 
  last couple of days tested yet another nuclear weapon but the leaders in asia do not feel the need to wave the flag to
  to actually allow escalation of the geopolitical and cross border tensions they want to focus on long term economic stability and growth  
 and that 's what they 're actually doing  
 let 's turn to europe 
 europe does look a little scared in this environment so much of what is happening in the middle east is washing up quite literally
 onto european shores you see
  see the concerns of populism across
 all of the european states  
 let me tell you that over the long term in a g zero world european expansion will be seen to have gone too far 
 europe went right up to russia went right down to the middle east and if the world were truly becoming more flat and more americanized that would be less of a problem but
  world those countries nearest russia and nearest the middle east actually have different economic capabilities different social stability and 
  different political preferences and systems than core europe so europe was able to truly expand under the 
 but under the g zero europe will get smaller core europe around germany and france and
  others will still work be functional stable wealthy integrated  
 but the periphery countries like greece and turkey and others will not look that good at all 
 latin america a lot of populism made the economies not go so well they had been more opposed to the united states
  they 're coming back  
 we see that in argentina  we see it with the openness in cuba  we will see it in venezuela when maduro falls we
 will see it in brazil after the after the impeachment and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there 
 the only place you see that that is moving in another direction is the unpopularity of mexican president pea nieto there you could actually see a slip away from the united states over the coming years the us election matters a lot
 on that one too 
 africa  right  a lot of people have said it 's going to be africa 's decade finally in a g zero world it is absolutely an amazing time for 
  a few african countries those governed well with a lot of urbanization a lot of smart people women really getting into the workforce entrepreneurship taking off but for most of the countries in africa
  it 's going to be a lot more dicey extreme climate conditions
 radicalism both from islam and also christianity very poor governance borders you can 't defend lots of forced migration those countries 
  can fall off the map so you 're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the
  the united states  what do i think about us because there are a lot of upset people not here at tedx i know  
 but in the united states my god after fifteen months of campaigning we should be upset i understand that 
 but a lot of people are upset because they say washington 's broken we don 't trust the establishment we hate the media heck even globalists like me
  taking it on the chin  look i do think
 we have to recognize  my fellow campers   that when you are being chased by the bear 
 in the global context you need not outrun the bear  
 you need to only outrun your fellow campers 
  i just told you about our fellow campers  right  and from that perspective  we look ok a
 lot of people in that context say let 's go dollar  let 's go new york real estate let 's send our kids to american universities you know 
 our neighbors are awesome canada mexico and two big bodies
  you know how much turkey would love to have neighbors like that those are awesome neighbors  
 terrorism is a problem in the united states  god knows we know it here in new york  
 but it 's a much bigger problem in europe than the us it 's a much bigger problem in the middle east than it is in europe  these are factors of large magnitude we just accepted ten thousand syrian refugees and we 're complaining bitterly about it
 you know why because they can 't swim here
 right  i mean the turks would love to have only ten thousand syrian refugees the jordanians 
 the germans the brits right  that 's not the situation  that 's the reality of the united states now that sounds pretty good 
 here 's the challenge in a g zero world
  the way you lead
 is by example 
 if we know we don 't want to be the global cop anymore if we know we 're not going to be the architect of global trade we 're not going to be the cheerleader of global values we 're not going to do it the way we used 
  to the 21st century is changing  we need to lead by example be so compelling that all these other people are going to still say it 's not just they 're faster campers 
  a good place to be we want to emulate them  the election process this year is not proving a good option
 for leading by example  
 hillary clinton says it 's going to be like the ' 90s we can still be that cheerleader on values we can still be the architect of global trade we can still be the global sheriff and donald trump
 wants to bring us back to the ' 30s he 's saying our way or the highway you don 't like it lump it
 are recognizing a fundamental truth of the g zero which is that even though the us is not in decline 
 it is getting objectively harder for the americans to impose their will even have great influence on the global order 
 are we prepared
 to truly
  lead by example what would we have to do to fix this
 after november after the next president comes in 
 well  either we have to have another crisis that forces us to respond 
 a depression would do that another global financial crisis could do this god forbid another nine eleven could do that or absent crisis  
 we need
 to see that the hollowing out
  the challenges that are growing and growing in the united states  are themselves urgent enough to force our leaders to change and that we have those voices 
 through our cell phones individually we have those voices to compel them to change  
 there is of course a third choice  
 perhaps the most likely one  
 which is that we do neither of those things and in four years time you invite me back  and i will give this speech yet again  
 thank you very very much
