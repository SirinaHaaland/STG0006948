  good morning everyone and i feel
 first of all it 's been fantastic being here over these past few days
 and secondly i feel it 's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people these amazing talks that we 've had
  i feel that i 've fitted in in many ways to some of the things that i 've heard
 i started off i came directly here
 from the deep deep tropical rainforest in ecuador
 where i was out you could only get there by a plane
 with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses where these people
  fighting to try and keep the oil companies and keep the roads out of their forests they 're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that 's clean a world that isn 't contaminated
 a world that isn 't polluted
 and what was so amazing to me and what fits right in with what we 're all talking about here at ted is that there right in the middle
  of this rainforest was some solar panels the first in that part of ecuador
 and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn 't have to go down the water was cleaned but because they got a lot of batteries they were able to store a lot of electricity 
 so every house and there were i think eight houses in this little community could have light for i think it was about half an hour each evening
 and there is the chief in all his regal finery with a laptop computer
 and this man he has been outside but he 's gone back
 and he was saying you know we we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era
 and we didn 't even know about the white man fifty years ago and now here we
  are with laptop computers and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world we want to know about health care we want to know
 about what other people do we 're interested in it and we want to learn other languages we want to know english and and french and perhaps chinese and we 're good at languages
 so there he is with his little laptop computer but fighting against the might
 of the pressures because of the debt the foreign debt of ecuador fighting the pressure of world bank imf
 and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil and
 so coming directly from there to here
 but of course my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization
  i can 't really call it a civilization a different way of life a different being
 we 've talked earlier this wonderful talk
 by wade wade davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world
 but the world is not composed only of human beings there are also other animal beings
 and i propose to bring into this ted
  conference as i always do around the world the voice of the animal kingdom too often we just see a few slides or a bit of film but these beings have voices that mean 
  something and so i want to give you a greeting as from a chimpanzee in the forests of tanzania ooh
  i 've been studying chimpanzees in tanzania since nineteen sixty
 during that time there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists
 do their work for example for the first time a few years ago by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them
 analyzed to have dna profiling done so for the first time we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant 
  because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society so this opens up a whole new avenue
  to determine the range of the chimps and we 're using
 you can see that i 'm not really into this kind of stuff but we 're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area
 and of course there 's developments in infrared so you can watch animals at night and
 equipment for recording by video and tape recording is getting lighter and better so in many many ways we can do things today that we couldn 't do when i began in nineteen sixty
 especially when chimpanzees and other animals with large brains are studied in captivity modern technology
  search for the upper levels of cognition
 in some of these non human animals so that we know today they 're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when i began
 i think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called ai in japan her name means love
 and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working
  with her she loves her computer she 'll leave her big group and her her running water and her trees and everything and she 'll come in to sit at this computer it 's like a video game for a kid she 's hooked she 's twenty eight by the way
 and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans she does very complex
 tasks and i haven 't got
  time to go into them but the amazing thing about this female is she
 doesn 't like making mistakes
 if she has a bad run and her score isn 't good she 'll come and reach up and tap on the glass because she can 't see the experimenter which is asking to have another go 
  and her concentration she 's already concentrated hard for twenty minutes or so and now she wants to do it all over again just for the
  satisfaction of having done it better
 and the food is not important she does get a tiny reward like one raisin for a correct response but she will do it for nothing if you tell her beforehand
  so here we are a chimpanzee using a computer chimpanzees gorillas orangutans also learn human sign language but
 the point is that when i was first in gombe
  in nineteen sixty i remember so well so vividly as though it was yesterday
 the first time when i was going through the vegetation the chimpanzees were still running away from me for the most part although some were a little bit acclimatized
 and i saw this dark shape hunched over a termite mound
 and i peered with my binoculars it was fortunately one adult male who
  david greybeard and by the way science at that time was telling me that i shouldn 't name the chimps they should all have numbers that was more scientific
 anyway david greybeard
 and i saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest and not only that he would sometimes pick a leafy 
  twig and strip the leaves modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose the beginning
  of tool making
 the reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time
 it was thought that humans and only humans used and made tools when i was at school we were defined as man the tool maker
 so that when louis leakey my mentor heard this news he said ah we must now redefine man redefine tool or accept chimpanzees as humans
  we now know that at gombe alone there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes
 moreover we know that in different parts of africa wherever chimps have been studied there are completely different tool using behaviors and because it seems 
  that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next through observation
  and practice that is a definition of human culture
 what we find is that over these forty odd years that i and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes
 and as i say other mammals with complex brains and social systems
 we have found that after all there isn 't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom it 's a very wuzzy
  line it 's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we in our arrogance used to think was just human
 the chimps there 's no time to discuss their fascinating lives but they have this long childhood five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother and then another 
  three four or five years of emotional dependence on her even when the next child is born
  the importance of learning in that time when behavior is flexible and there 's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society
 the long term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother with the brothers and sisters and which can last through
  a lifetime which may be up to sixty years they can actually live longer than sixty in captivity so we 've only done forty years in the
  wild so far and
 we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism
 we find in their non verbal communication this is very rich they have a lot of sounds which they use in different circumstances but they also use 
 touch posture gesture and what do they do they kiss they embrace they hold hands they pat one another on the back they swagger they shake their
  fist the kind of things that we do
 and they do them in the same kind of context they have very sophisticated cooperation sometimes they hunt not that often but when they hunt they show sophisticated cooperation and they share the prey
 we find that they show emotions similar to maybe sometimes the same as those that we describe
  in ourselves as happiness sadness fear despair they know mental as well as physical suffering and i don 't have time to go into the
 information that will prove some of these things to you save to say that there are very bright students in the best universities studying emotions in animals studying personalities in animals
 we know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors self as opposed
  to other they have a sense of humor
 and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives but
 this teaches us a new respect and it 's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees i suggest but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet once we 're prepared to admit
 that after all we 're not the only beings
 with personalities minds and above all feelings and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient sapient creatures 
 on this planet it really gives cause for for deep shame
  who 've perhaps taught us more than any other creature a little humility
 are in the wild disappearing very fast
 they 're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well the deforestation the growth of human populations needing more land
 they 're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear cutting they 're disappearing in the heart of their range
  africa
 because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads as they want to do in ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched
 to take out oil or timber
 and
 this has led in congo basin and other parts of the world to what is known as the bush meat trade this means that although for hundreds
  thousands of years people have lived in those forests or whatever habitat it is in harmony with their world just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families
 now suddenly because of the roads the hunters can go in from the towns they shoot everything every single thing that moves that 's bigger than a than a small rat they sun dry it or smoke it and now they 've got transport they take it on the
  logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it and people will pay more
 for bush meat as it 's called than for domestic meat it 's culturally preferred and it 's not sustainable and the huge logging camps in the forest
  are now demanding meat so the pygmy hunters in the congo basin who 've lived there
  living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted they 're given weapons they shoot for the logging camps they get money their culture is being destroyed
 along with the animals upon whom they depend so when the logging camp moves there 's nothing left
 we talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity and i 've seen it happening with my own eyes and the grim picture in africa i love africa
 and what do we see in africa we see we see
 deforestation we see the desert spreading
 we see massive hunger
 we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support and they 're too poor to buy food from elsewhere
 were the people that we heard about
  yesterday on the easter island who cut down their last tree were they stupid didn 't they know what was happening of course but if you 've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts 
  of the world it isn 't a question of let 's leave the tree for tomorrow how am i going to feed my family today maybe i can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will
 keep us going a little bit longer and then we 'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end so
 this is a pretty grim picture
 the one thing we have which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures is this sophisticated spoken language a language with which we can 
  tell children about things that aren 't here we can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future discuss ideas with each other so that the
  ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group we can do it by talking to each other we can do it through
 video we can do it through the written word and we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards
 and we 're destroying the world in the developed world in a way it 's worse because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we 're doing do you know
 we 're bringing little babies
 into a world where in many places the water is poisoning them
 and the air is harming them
 and the food that 's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them and that 's not just in the far away developing world that 's everywhere do you know we all have about fifty
  chemicals in our bodies we didn 't have about fifty years ago and so many of these diseases like
 asthma and certain kinds of cancers are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped
 we 're harming ourselves around the world as well as harming the animals as well as harming nature herself mother nature that brought us into being
 mother nature where i believe we need to spend time
  time where there 's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development
 and yet there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature because they 're growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun or in in the forest with the dappled
 sun specks coming down from the canopy above
 as i was traveling around the world you know i had to leave the forest that 's where i love to be
 i had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying
 because finding they dwindled from about two million one hundred years ago to about one hundred and fifty thousand now
 i knew i had to leave the forest to do what i could to raise awareness around the world and the more
  i talked about the chimpanzees plight the more i realized the fact that everything 's interconnected and the problems of the developing world so often stem 
 from the greed of the developed world and everything was joining together and making not sense
  and as i was traveling around i kept meeting young people who 'd lost hope
 they were feeling despair
 they were feeling well it doesn 't matter what we do eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die everything is hopeless we 're always being told so by the media
 and then i met some who were angry and anger that can turn to violence and we 're all familiar with that
 and
  i have three little grandchildren and when some of these
 students would say to me at high school or university they 'd say we 're angry or we 're filled with despair because we feel you 've compromised our future and there 's nothing we can do about it
 and i looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren and think how much we 've harmed this planet since i was their age i feel this deep shame
 and that
  's why in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one in tanzania i started a program that 's called roots and shoots there 's little brochures all around outside
 and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future i beg that you pick up that brochure
 and roots and shoots is a program for hope roots make a firm foundation shoots seem tiny
  tiny but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls see the brick walls as all the problems that we 've inflicted on this planet then
 you see it is a message of hope hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better better world
 and the most important message of roots and shoots is that every single individual makes a difference every individual
  has a role to play
 every one of us impacts the world around us every day and you scientists know that you can 't actually even if you stay in bed all day you 're breathing oxygen and giving out cotwo
 and probably going to the loo and things like that you 're making a difference in the world
 so
 the roots and shoots program involves youth in
 three kinds of projects
 and these are projects to make the world around them a better place one project to show care and concern for your own human community
 one for animals including domestic animals and i have to say i learned everything i know about animal behavior even before i got
  and the chimps from my dog rusty who was my childhood companion
 and the third kind of project something for the local environment
 so
 what the kids do depends first of all how old are they and we go now from pre school right through university
 it 's going to depend whether they 're inner city or rural it 's going to depend if they 're wealthy or impoverished it 's going to depend which part say of america they 're in
  state now and the problems in florida are different from the problems in new york
 it 's going to depend on which country they 're in and we 're already in sixty plus countries with about five thousand active groups and there are groups all over 
  the place that i keep hearing about that i 've never even heard of because the kids are taking
  the program and spreading it themselves why
 because they 're buying into it and they 're the ones who get to decide what they 're going to do it isn 't something that that their parents tell them or their teachers tell them that 's effective but if they decide themselves
 we want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there we want to clear away the toxic
 soil from this area and have an organic garden we want to go and
  spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories
 we want to go and work in a dog shelter we want to learn about animals we want you know it goes on and on and this is very hopeful for me
 as i travel around the world three hundred days a year everywhere there 's a group of roots and
  shoots of different ages everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying look at the difference we 've made
 and now comes the technology into it because with with this new
 way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world
 and if anyone is interested to help us we 've got so many ideas but we need help we need help to to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their
  but also and this is so important to
 to communicate their despair to say we 've tried this and it doesn 't work and what shall we do and then lo and behold there 's another group
 answering these kids who may be in america or maybe this is a group in israel saying yeah you did it a little bit wrong this is how you should do it
  we do not believe in violence no violence no bombs
 no guns that 's not the way to solve problems violence leads to violence at least in my view
 so
 how do we solve the tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding know the facts but see how they fit in the big picture
 hard work and persistence don 't give up and love and compassion
 leading to respect for all life how many more minutes two one
 one one to two two two i 'm going to take two are you going to come and drag me off
 anyway so
 so basically roots and shoots is beginning to change young people 's lives it 's what i 'm devoting most of my energy to
 and
 i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact not just because you can share technology with us but because so many of you have children
 and if you take this program out and give it to your children they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good because they 've got parents like you
  so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place it 's very encouraging
 but the kids do ask me and this won 't take more than two minutes i promise the kids say
 doctor jane do you really have hope for the future you travel you see all these horrible things happening firstly
 the human brain i don 't need to say anything about that now
  we know what the problems are around the world human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems and we 've talked a lot about that
 secondly the resilience of nature
 we can destroy a river and we can bring it back to life we can see
 a whole area desolated and it can be brought back to bloom again with time or a little help
 and thirdly the last speaker talked about 
  or the speaker before last talked about the indomitable human spirit we are surrounded by the most amazing people who
 do things that seem to be absolutely impossible nelson mandela i take a little piece of limestone from robben island prison where he labored for twenty seven years and came out
  so little bitterness he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath
 even after the eleventh of september and i was in new york and i felt the fear
 nevertheless
 there was so much human courage so much love and so much compassion
 and then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear the fear that was leading to people
  feeling they couldn 't worry about the environment any more in case they seemed not to be patriotic and i was trying to encourage them
 somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi
 if you look back through human history you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good
 and just after that a woman brought me this little bell and i want to end on this note she said if you 're talking about hope
  and peace ring this
 this bell is made from metal from a defused landmine from the killing fields of pol pot
 one of the most evil regimes in human history where people are now beginning to put their lives back together
 after the regime has crumbled so yes there is hope and where
  is the hope is it out there with the politicians
 it 's in our hands it 's in your hands and my hands
 and those of our children it 's really up to us we 're the ones who can make a difference if we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible 
 ecological footprints if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don 't buy the things that are not we can change the world
