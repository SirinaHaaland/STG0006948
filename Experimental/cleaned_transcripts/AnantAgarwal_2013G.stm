  i 'd like to reimagine education  
 the last year has seen the invention of a new four letter word it starts with an m mooc 
 massive open online
  many organizations
 are offering these online courses to students all over the world in the millions 
 for free  anybody who has an internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it  
 now  in this discussion today i 'm going to focus on a different aspect of
  we are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education
 to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom now our classrooms could use change  so here 's a classroom
 at this little three letter institute in the northeast of america mit  and this was a classroom about fifty or sixty years ago and this is a classroom today
  what 's changed  the seats are in color whoop de do 
 education really hasn 't changed
 in the past five hundred years the last big innovation
 in education was the printing press and the textbooks  everything else has changed around us you know from healthcare to transportation  everything is different
  education hasn 't changed it 's
 also been a real issue in terms of access  so what you see here is not a rock concert  and the person you see at the end of the stage
 is not madonna this is a classroom at the obafemi awolowo university in nigeria  
  we 've all heard of distance education  but the students way in the back two hundred feet away from the instructor i think they are undergoing
 education now i really believe
 that we can transform education both in quality and scale and access through technology 
 for example  at edx 
  are trying to transform education through online technologies
  given education has been calcified for five hundred years  
 we really cannot think about reengineering it  micromanaging it we really have to completely reimagine it it 's like going from ox carts
 to the airplane even the infrastructure has to change everything has to change we need to go from
 lectures on the blackboard to online exercises online videos  we have to go to interactive virtual
  laboratories and gamification we have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards  everything really has to change  
 so at edx and a number of other organizations we are applying these technologies to education
 through moocs to really increase access to education and you heard of this example where when we launched our very first course and this was 
 circuits and electronics course about a year
 year and a half ago one hundred and fifty five thousand students
 from one hundred and sixty two countries enrolled in this course and we had no marketing budget 
 now one hundred and fifty five thousand is a big number this number is bigger than the total number of alumni of mit in its
  passed the course and this was a hard course  seven thousand two hundred is also a big number  
 if i were to teach at mit two semesters every year  i would have to teach for forty years
 before i could teach this many students
 now these large numbers are just one part of the story  so today i want to discuss a different aspect the other side of moocs take a different perspective
 we are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom to create a blended model of learning 
 but before i go into that let me tell you a story  
 when my daughter
 turned thirteen became a teenager  she stopped speaking english and she began speaking this new language  i call it
 teen lish it 's a digital language it 's got two sounds a grunt and a silence 
 honey come over for dinner
 were just not communicating  until one day i had this epiphany  i texted her 
 i got an instant response  
 i said no that must have been by accident she must have thought you know some friend of hers was calling her so
 i texted her again  boom another response i said this is great  
 and so since then our life has changed  i text her she responds it 's just been absolutely great
 so our millennial generation is built differently now
 i 'm older and my youthful looks might belie that but
 i 'm not in the millennial generation but our kids are really different  the millennial generation is completely
 comfortable with online technology  so why are we fighting it in the classroom let 's not fight it let 's embrace it in fact i believe and i have two fat thumbs i can 't text very well
 but i 'm willing to bet that with evolution our kids and and their grandchildren will develop really really little itty bitty thumbs to text much better that evolution will fix all of that stuff  
 but what if we embraced technology embraced the millennial generation 's
 natural predilections and really think about creating these online technologies blend them into their lives  so here 's what we can
  do so rather than driving our kids into a classroom herding them out there at eight o 'clock in the morning
 i hated going to class at eight o 'clock in the morning 
 so why are we forcing our kids to do that so instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms in their bedroom in the dining room in the
  they 're most creative then they come into the classroom
 for some in person interaction  
 they can have discussions amongst themselves they can solve problems together they can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions  
 in fact 
 with edx when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world this was happening unbeknownst to us 
 two high school teachers at the sant high school in mongolia
  had flipped their classroom  and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises  where the learners in the high school 15 year olds mind you would go and do these things in their 
  own homes and they would come into class and as you see from this image here  they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work 
  also doing other pilots  so we did a pilot experimental blended courses working with san jose state university in california 
 again with the circuits and electronics course you 'll hear that a lot that course has become
 sort of like our petri dish of learning  so there the students would again  the instructors flipped the classroom 
 blended online and in person and the results were staggering 
 now don 't take these results to the bank just yet 
 just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more but the early results are incredible  
 so traditionally semester upon semester for the past several years this course again a hard course 
 had a failure rate of about forty to forty one percent every semester with this blended class late last year  
 the failure rate fell to nine percent 
 so the results can be
  extremely extremely good now before we go
 too far into this i 'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas what are some key ideas that makes all of this work 
 one idea is active learning the idea here is rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures
  we replace this with what we call lessons lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises  so a student might watch a 
  video and follow that with an interactive exercise think of this as the ultimate 
 of education you teach by asking questions  and this is a form of learning called active learning and really promoted by a very early paper
  retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing students learn much better when they are interacting with the material  
 the second idea is self pacing 
 now when i went to a lecture hall and if you were like me by the fifth minute i would lose the professor  i wasn 't all that smart and i would be scrambling taking notes  and then i would lose
  the rest of the hour instead wouldn 't it be nice with online technologies we offer videos and interactive engagements to students  they can hit the pause button  
 they can rewind the professor 
 heck  they can even mute the professor  so this form of self pacing can be very helpful to learning  
 the third idea that we have is instant feedback  with instant
  how else do you teach one hundred and fifty thousand students your computer is grading all the exercises and we 've all submitted homeworks and
 your grades come back two weeks later you 've forgotten all about it  
 i don 't think i 've still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days some are never graded  
 so with instant feedback students can try to apply answers if they get it wrong  they can get instant feedback they can try it again and try it again and this really becomes much more engaging they get the instant feedback  
 and this little green check mark that you see here
  here
 is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edx 
 learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark
 in fact one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year  he then went on to take a software course from berkeley at the end of the year 
 and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course
  check mark 
 oh god have i missed you 
 when 's the last time you 've seen students posting comments like this about homework 
 my colleague ed bertschinger who heads up the physics department at mit 
 has this to say about instant feedback he indicated that instant feedback
 turns teaching moments
 into learning
  outcomes  
 the next big idea is gamification you know all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on you know they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it  
 so we applied these gamification techniques to learning and we can build these online laboratories how do you teach creativity how do you teach design we can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs  so as this little video shows
 you can engage students much like they design with legos  so here the learners are building a circuit with lego like ease  
 and this can also be graded by the computer 
 fifth is peer learning  so here  we use discussion forums and discussions and facebook like interaction not
  but to really help students learn let me tell you a story
 when we did our
 circuits course for the one hundred and fifty five thousand students
 i didn 't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course
 i told my tas okay twenty four seven we 're going to be up monitoring the forum answering questions they had answered questions for one hundred students how do you do that for one hundred and fifty thousand 
 so one night i 'm sitting up there at two a m at night and i think there 's this question from a student from pakistan
 and he asked a question and i said okay let me go and type up an answer i don 't type all that fast and i begin typing up the answer  and before i can finish
 another student from egypt popped in with an answer not quite right so i 'm fixing the answer  and before i can finish a student from the u s had popped in with a different answer  
 and then i sat back fascinated  
 boom boom
  the students were discussing and interacting with each other and by four a m that night i 'm totally fascinated  having this epiphany and by four a m in the morning they had discovered the right answer  
 and all i had to do was go and bless it good answer 
 so this this is absolutely amazing where students are learning from each other and they 're telling us that they are learning by teaching 
 now this is all not just in the future
  so we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world from tsinghua in china to the national university of mongolia in mongolia to berkeley in california
 all over the world and these kinds of technologies really help the blended model can really help revolutionize education 
 it can also solve a practical problem of moocs  
 the business aspect we can also license these mooc courses to other universities and therein
 lies a revenue model for moocs where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next generation textbook  
 they can use as much or as little as they like and it becomes a tool in the teacher 's arsenal  
 finally  i would like to have you dream with me for a little bit i would like us to really reimagine education
  we will have to move from lecture halls to e spaces 
 we have to move from books to tablets like the  aakash in india or the raspberry pi twenty dollars the aakash is forty dollars  
 we have to move from bricks and mortar school buildings
 to digital dormitories  but i think at the end of the day i think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities
  otherwise how else do we tell our grandchildren that  your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks
 and watched this professor at the end
 talk about content and you know  you didn 't even have a rewind button  thank you
