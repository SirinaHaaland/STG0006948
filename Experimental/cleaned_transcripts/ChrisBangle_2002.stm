  what i want to talk about is as background is the idea that cars are art this is actually quite meaningful to
 to me because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole we don 't do coffee
 coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it and cars are thought so much as a product that it 's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side
 under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art  and so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane if you accept that
 that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital  a now at this point you 're going to see a picture of michelangelo  this is completely
  and they 're not very emotional they solve a purpose and certainly automobiles have been around for one hundred years and have made our lives functionally
 a lot better in many ways  they 've also been a real pain in the ass  
 because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve we have to solve the pollution we have to solve the congestion
 but that 's not what interests me in this speech what interests me in this speech is
  cars  automobiles may be what you use  but cars are what we are in many ways  and
 as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles and i believe we can with fuel cells or hydrogen like bmw is really hip on 
 and lots of other things then i think we can look past that and try and understand why
  hook is in many of us
 of this car y ness and what that means what we can learn from it that 's what i want to get to 
 cars are not a suit of clothes cars are an avatar cars are an expansion
 of yourself they
 take your thoughts your ideas your emotions and they multiply it your anger whatever  it 's an avatar  it 's a super waldo that you happen to be inside of and if you feel sexy the car is sexy  and if you 're full of road
  you 've got a chevy like a rock right cars are a sculpture
 did you know this that every car you see out there is sculpted by hand 
 many people think well it 's computers and it 's done by machines and stuff like that well they reproduce it  but the originals are all done by hand it 's done by by men and women
 who believe a lot in their craft  
 and they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum that tension between
 the need to express
  to discover  then you put something new into it and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship 
 rules that say  this is how you handle surfaces  this is what control is all about this is how you show you 're a master of your craft  
 and that tension that discovery that push for something new and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship
 that 's as strong in cars as it is in anything we work in clay  which hasn 't changed much since
  michelangelo started screwing around with it and there 's a very interesting analogy to that too real quickly
 michelangelo once said he 's there to discover the figure within ok  
 there we go the automobile that was one hundred years right there did you catch that 
 between that one there  and that one there it changed a lot didn 't it ok it
 's not marketing there 's a very interesting car concept here  but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here i want to talk about this
  why it means you have to wash a car what is it that sensuality you have to touch about it   that 's the sculpture that goes into it that sensuality  and it 's done by men 
  and women working just like this  making cars  now this little quote about sculpture from henry moore 
 comes right back to this idea of the mean  it 's that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car and takes over people like me  and we tell other people do this do this do this until this thing comes alive  we are completely infected 
 and beauty
 can be the result of this infectiousness it 's quite wonderful 
 this sculpture is of course at the heart of all of it and it 's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars and it
 's not a whole lot different really when they 're working like this or when somebody works like this
 it 's that same kind of commitment that same kind of beauty now now i get to the point i
 want to talk about cars as art art in the platonic sense is truth  it 's beauty and love  now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers  
 we don 't really have a problem talking about love  we don 't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense that 's what we 're searching for when we 're working our craft  we are really trying to find that truth out there
  not trying to find vanity and beauty we 're trying to find the beauty in the truth  however engineers tend to look at things a little bit more
 newtonian  instead of this quantum approach we 're dealing with irrationalisms and we 're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four and if you get four point zero it 's better and four point zero is even better
  and that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence
 in why we 're doing what we 're doing we 've pretty much accepted the fact though that we are the women in the organization at bmw bmw is a very manly type business  men men men it 's engineers
  and we 're kind of the female side to that that 's ok that 's cool you go off and be manly we 're going to be a little bit more female 
 because what we 're interested in
 is finding form that 's more than just a
  we 're interested in finding beauty that 's more than just an aesthetic it 's really a truth  and i think this idea of soul as being at the heart of great cars 
 is very applicable you all know it  you know a car when you 've seen it with soul  you know how strong this is  
 well this experience of love and the experience of design to me are interchangeable and now i 'm coming to my story  
 i discovered something about love
 and design
 through a project called deep blue  and first of all you have to go with me for a second  and say
 you know you could take the word love out of a lot of things in our society put the word design in and it still works like this quote here you know it
 kind of works you know  you can understand that it works in truisms all is fair in design and war 
 certainly we live in a competitive society  i think this one here there 's a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me  
 you know  this is like you know this is like puppy love you know this is cool right
 it really only gets serious when you look at something like this ok 
 this is one substitution that i believe all of us in design management are guilty of 
 and this idea that there is more to love  more to design when it gets down to your neighbor your
  it can be physical like this and maybe in the future it will be but right now it 's in dealing with our own people our own teams who are doing the creating so to my story 
 the idea of
 people work is what we work with here  and i have to make a bond with my designers when we 're creating bmws  
 we have to have a shared intimacy a shared vision that means we have to work as one family we have to understand ourselves that way there 's good times there 's interesting times 
 and there 's some stress times too you want to do cars you 've got to go outside
 you 've got to do cars in the rain  you 've got to do cars in the snow
  that 's by the way is a presentation we made to our board of directors we haul their butts out in the snow too you want to know cars outside 
 well you 've got to stand outside to do this and because these are artists 
 they have very artistic temperaments all
 now one thing about art is art is discovery  and art is discovering yourself through your art
  one thing about cars is we 're all a little bit like pygmalion  we are completely in love with our own creations this is one of my favorite paintings
 it really describes our relationship with cars this is sick beyond belief but
 because of this  the intimacy with which we work together as a team
 takes on a new dimension a new meaning  we have a shared center
  we have a shared focus
 that car stays at the middle of all our relationships  and it 's my job in the competitive process to narrow this down i
 heard today about about joseph 's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction 
 you know that 's what i have to do sometimes 
 we start out with ten cars we narrow it down to five cars down to
  cars down to two cars down to one car  and i 'm in the middle of that
 killing basically  someone 's love  someone 's baby  this is very difficult and you have to have a bond with your team
 that permits you to do this  because their life is wrapped up in that too  they 've got that gene infected in them as well  and they want that to live more than
  this project deep blue  
 put me in contact with my team in a way that i never expected and i want to pass it on to you because i want you to reflect on this  perhaps in your own relationships  we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap 
  of faith for bmw  we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it that i only had a phone number that connected me to them 
 staff of artists that are just your wrist we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers
 to find out what 's the successor to the suv phenomenon in america  this is one thousand nine hundred and ninety six we did this project and so we sent them off
 with this team name deep blue  now many people know deep blue from ibm we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they 'd think we 're talking about computers it
 turned out it was quite clever because
  so people get wrapped up in it  and we took a team of designers and we sent them off to america  
 and we gave them a budget what we thought was a set of deliverables a timetable and nothing else  like i said i just had a phone number that connected me to them and a group of engineers
 worked in germany  and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what 's the successor to the suv they would come together compare
  then they would work apart  come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn 't pollute each other 's ideas but at the same time came together and resolved the problems 
 hopefully really understand the customer at its heart where the customer is live with them in america  so
 sent the team off and actually something different happened  they went other places
  all i got was postcards 
 now i got some postcards of these guys in las vegas and i got some postcards of these guys in the grand canyon and i got these postcards of niagara falls  and pretty soon they 're in new york and i don 't know where else  
 and i 'm telling myself this is going to be a great car they 're doing research that i
  six or seven apartments it was cheaper to rent elizabeth taylor 's ex house in malibu  and
 at least they told me it was her house i guess it was at one time she had a party there or something but anyway  
  who 'd left their some had left their wives behind and families behind 
 and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in america but the first three months were the most intensive  
 and one of the young women in the project she was a fantastic lady
  she actually built her room in the bathroom the bathroom was so big  she built the bed over the bathtub
 it 's quite fascinating
 on the other hand i didn 't know anything about this  
 ok  nothing  this is all going on  and all i 'm getting is postcards of these guys in las vegas or whatever saying don 't worry chris this is really going to be good ok  
 so my concept of what a design studio was probably i wasn 't up to speed on where these guys were
  however the engineers back in in munich had taken on this kind of newtonian solution
 and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin and you know 
 these really serious questions that that are confronting the modern consumer  and one was hoping that these two teams would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under these incredible surroundings 
 and these incredibly stressed out engineers would create some
  i didn 't know was and what we found out was these guys they can 't even like talk to each other
 under those conditions you get a divergence of newtonian and quantum thinking at that point you have a split
 in your dialog that is so deep and so far  that they cannot bring this together at all and
 so we had our first meeting  after three months in tiburon which is just up the road from here you know tiburon  
 and the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to dr goschel who is now my boss and at that time he was co mentor on the project
 and they would present their results  we would see where we were going we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in america 
  and so i had these ideas in my head that this is going to be great i mean i 'm going to see so much work it 's so intense i know
  probably las vegas meant a lot about it 
 and i 'm not really sure where the grand canyon came in either but somehow all this is going to come together and i 'm going to see some really great product  so we went to tiburon  after three months 
 and the team had gotten together the week before
  many days ahead of time the engineers flew over and designers got together
  it turns out that
 the engineers hadn 't done anything  and they hadn 't done anything because
 kind of like in car business engineers are there to solve problems  and we were asking them to create a problem 
 and the engineers were waiting for the designers to say this is the problem that we 've created  now help us solve it
  't talk about it  so what happened was the engineers showed up with nothing  
 and the engineers told the designers if you go in with all your stuff we 'll walk out we
 'll walk right out of the project 
 so i didn 't know any of this  and we got a presentation that had an agenda looked like this there was a whole lot of
  we spent four hours
 being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers 
 and here i 'm expecting at any moment ok they 're going to turn the page and i 'm going to see the cars i 'm going to see the sketches i 'm going to see maybe some idea of where it 's going 
 dialog kept on going with mental maps of words  
 and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance i was seriously being baffled with bullshit  
 and if you can imagine
  what this is like to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working and they 're out there spending all this money and they 're learning and they 're doing all this stuff
  i went fucking ballistic right i went
 nuts you can probably remember tiburon it used to look like this
  after four hours of this  i stood up and i took this team apart  i screamed at them  i yelled at them what the hell are you doing 
 you 're letting me down you 're my designers  you 're supposed to be the creative ones what the hell is going on around here 
 it was probably one of my better tirades i have some good ones but this was probably one of my better ones 
 and i went into these people how could they take bmw 's money how could they
  because of course they didn 't tell us that they had
 three station wagons full of drawings  model concepts pictures everything i wanted they 'd locked up in the cars  
 because they had shown solidarity with the engineers
 and they 'd decided not to show me anything in order to give the
  chance for problem solving a chance to start because they hadn 't realized of course that
 they couldn 't do problem creating  so we went to lunch 
 and
 i 've got to tell you this was one seriously quiet lunch  the engineers all sat at one end of the table the
 designers and i sat at the other end of the table  
 really quiet
 you know that 's what you get furious about right  and somebody asked me about catherine my wife  you know  did she fly out with me or something i said no 
 and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife  and
 i recalled that when catherine and i were married  the priest gave a very nice sermon  and he said something very important  he said love
  does not mean counting how many times i say ' i love you ' it doesn 't mean
 you had sex this many times this month and it 's two times less than last month  so that means you don 't love me as much love is not selfish 
 and i thought about this  and i thought you know
  i 'm not showing love here 
 i 'm seriously
  i 'm in the air  i 'm in the air without trust  this cannot be  
 this cannot be that i 'm expecting a certain number of sketches  
 and to me that 's my quantification method for qualifying a team this cannot be 
 so i told them this story  i said guys  i 'm thinking about something here  this isn 't right  
 i can 't have a relationship with you guys
  we all broke down into tears to be quite honest about it  because
 they still could not tell me
 how much frustration they had built up inside of them not being able to show me what i wanted and merely having to ask me to trust
 that it would come  
 and i think we felt much closer that day we cut a lot of strings that didn 't need to be there  
 and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about 
 we put the car back at the center of our of our thoughts  and we put love  
 i think  truly back into the
 center of the process  by the way that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation
 after suvs in america one of those
 was
 the idea of a crossover coupes you see it downstairs  the x coupe they
 had a lot of fun with that it was the rendition of our motorcycle the gs as carl magnusson
  as the idea of what could be a motorcycle  if you add two more wheels  
 and so  in conclusion my lesson that i wanted to pass on to you was this one here i 'm also going to steal a little quote out of little prince there 's a lot to be said about trust
 and love  if you know that those two words are synonymous for design 
 i had a very very meaningful relationship with my team that day  and it 's stayed that way ever since  and i hope that
 that you too find that there 's more to design
  design and more towards the art of the design than doing it yourself it 's true that the trust and the love  that makes it worthwhile  thanks so much
