  i am honored to be here and i 'm honored to talk about this topic which i think is of grave importance we 've been talking a lot about the
 horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species  but plastic
 hurts people too
 especially poor people  
 and both in the production of plastic the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic the people who have the bull 's eye on their foreheads
 are poor people people got very upset
 when the bp oil spill happened for very good reason people thought
 in the water it 's going to destroy
 the the living systems there people are going to be hurt this is a terrible thing this oil is going to hurt the people in the gulf 
 what people don 't think about is what if the oil had made it safely to shore 
 what if the oil actually got where it was trying to go 
 not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming but
 there 's a place called
  alley 
 and the reason it 's called cancer alley is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and in the process  kills people  
 it shortens the lives of the people who live there in the gulf so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there 's a spill they 're a problem when there 's not and
 what we don 't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products 
 the other thing we often don 't appreciate is it 's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer 
 poor people also suffer
 at the point of use those of us who earn a certain income level we have something called choice
 the reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices economic choices
  we actually get a chance to choose not to use
 products that have dangerous poisonous plastic in them other people who are poor don 't have those choices  so low income people often are the ones who are buying the products that
 have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using those are the people who wind up ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic in using it and people say well  they should just
  being poor is you don 't have those choices you often have to buy the cheapest products the cheapest products are often the most dangerous  
 and if that weren 't bad enough if it wasn 't just the production of plastic
 that 's giving people cancer in places like cancer alley and shortening lives and
 hurting poor kids at the point of use at the point of disposal once again it 's poor people who bear the burden
  your bottled water or whatever it is and you think to yourself i 'm going to throw this away no i 'm going to be virtuous  i 'm going to put it in the blue bin
  we kind of have this moral feel good moment  but if we were to be able to follow that little bottle
 on its journey  we would be shocked to discover that all too often that bottle is going to be put on a boat 
 it 's going to go all the way across the ocean
 at some expense  and it 's going to wind up in a developing country often china
  in our minds we imagine somebody 's going to take the little bottle and say oh little bottle  we 're so happy to see you little bottle
  you know  that bottle
 winds up getting burned  the recycling of plastic in many developing countries
 means the incineration of the plastic  the burning of the plastic  which releases incredible toxic chemicals and once again kills people  
 and so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like
 cancer alley poor people who are consuming these
  products disproportionately and then poor people who even at the at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened they 're all
 being harmed greatly by this
 addiction that we have to disposability now you think to yourself
  i know how you are you say that sure is terrible for those poor people
 it 's just awful those
 those poor people i hope someone does something to help them but what we don 't understand is
 here we are in los angeles  
 we worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in los angeles  but guess what because they 're doing so much dirty production in asia now  
 because the environmental laws don 't protect the people in asia now  
 almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic
  air gains that we 've achieved here in california have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from asia
 so we all are being hit we all are being impacted it 's just that the poor people get it first and worst 
 but the dirty production the burning of toxins  the lack of environmental standards in asia is actually creating so much dirty
 air pollution it 's coming across the ocean and has erased our gains here in california  we 're back where we were in
 and so we 're on one planet 
 and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems the root of this problem in my view 
 is the idea of disposability itself  you see 
 if you understand the link between
 what we 're doing to poison and pollute the planet
 and what we 're doing to poor
  arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight 
 in order to trash the planet  you have to trash people  
 but if you create a world where you don 't trash people you can 't trash the planet 
 so now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea 
 we finally can now see that they are
  the day one idea and it 's the idea that we don 't have disposable anything we don 't have disposable
 resources we don 't have disposable
 species  and we don 't have disposable people either 
 we don 't have a throwaway planet and we don 't have throwaway children it 's all precious 
 and as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding new opportunities for action begin to emerge
  winds up being a very important social justice idea people who are just learning about this stuff biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species  
 democracy by the way means respecting the wisdom of all people we 'll get to that  but biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species  it turns out
 we 're a pretty clever species we have this big
  pretty proud of ourselves  but if we want to make something hard we say i know i 'm going to make a hard substance i know  i 'm going to get
 vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and  poison and pollute but i got this hard thing 
 i 'm so clever and you look behind you and there 's destruction all around you but guess what
  as clever as a clam
  a clamshell is hard there 's no vacuums there 's no big furnaces there 's no poison there 's no pollution it turns out
 that other species figured out a long time ago
 how to create many of the things we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well  that insight of biomimicry of our scientists finally realizing
 that we have as much to learn from other species i don 't mean
 taking a mouse and
 sticking it with stuff
 i don 't mean looking at it from that way  abusing the little species i mean actually respecting them respecting what they 've achieved 
 that 's called biomimicry  and that opens the door to zero waste production zero pollution production that we could actually
 enjoy a high quality of life a high standard of living  without trashing the planet
  that idea
 of biomimicry respecting the wisdom of all species  
 combined with the idea of democracy and social justice respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people 
 would give us a different society  we would have a different economy  we would have a green society
 that dr king
 would be proud of that should be the goal  and the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability
 not only hurts
 the species we 've talked about but it even corrupts our own society we 're so proud to live here in california  we just had this vote
  though we lead the world in some of the green stuff we also unfortunately lead the world in some of the gulag stuff  california has
 one of the highest incarceration rates
 of all the fifty states we have a moral challenge in this movement we are passionate about
 rescuing some dead materials from the landfill but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing
 living beings living people  and i would say that we live in a country five percent of the world 's population twenty five percent of the greenhouse gases  
 but also twenty five percent of the world 's prisoners  one of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the united states so
 that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in and yet
 as a movement that has to
 broaden its constituency 
 that has to grow  that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone one of the challenges to the success of this movement of getting rid of things like plastic and and helping the economy shift is people look at our movement with some suspicion  
 and they ask a question and the question is how can these people be so passionate
 a poor person  a low income person somebody in cancer alley  somebody
 in in watts  somebody in harlem somebody on an indian reservation  might say to themselves and rightfully so how can these people be so passionate
 about making sure that a plastic bottle
 has a second chance in life  or an aluminum can has a second chance  and yet when my child gets in trouble and
 goes to prison  he doesn 't get a second chance how can this movement be so passionate about saying we don 't have throwaway stuff  no throwaway dead materials and yet accept
 throwaway lives and throwaway communities like cancer alley and so we now get a chance to
 be truly proud of this movement when we take on topics like this it gives us that extra call
 to reach out
  to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow  and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we 've been in most of you are good softhearted people
  when you were younger  you cared about the whole world and at some point somebody said you had to pick  pick an issue
  you had to boil your love down to an issue can 't love the whole world you 've got to work on trees or you 've got to work on immigration
  shrink it down and be about one issue and really  they fundamentally told you 
 are you going to hug a tree or are you going to hug a child  pick are you going to hug a tree or are you going to hug a child pick well 
 when you start working on issues like plastic you realize the whole thing is connected 
 and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms we can hug both  thank you very much
