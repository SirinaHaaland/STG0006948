  this is about a hidden corner of the labor market  it 's the world of people who need to work ultra flexibly if they 're to work at all 
 so think for instance of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical
  who 's caring for a dependent adult or a parent with complex child care needs their availability for work can be such that it 's a few hours today maybe i can work tomorrow but i don 't know if and when yet 
 and it 's extraordinarily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very badly 
 which is a tragedy because there are employers who can use pools of very
  very flexible local people booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work 
 imagine that you run a cafe it 's mid morning the place is filling up you 're going to have a busy lunchtime rush if you could get two extra workers for ninety minutes
 to start in an hour 's time you 'd do it but they 'd have to be reliable inducted in how your cafe works they 'd have to be available at very competitive rates 
 they 'd have to be bookable in about the next minute 
 in reality no recruitment agency wants
  to handle that sort of business  so you are going to muddle by understaffed and
 it 's not just caterers it 's hoteliers it 's retailers it 's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses 
 there 's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people possibly already once they 've been inducted 
 at this level of the labor market what you need is a marketplace for spare hours they do exist
  's how they work  so in this example a distribution company has said we 've got a rush order that we 've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning 
 show us everyone who 's available it 's found thirty one workers  everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow they 're all contactable in time for this booking 
 they 've all defined the terms on which they will accept
  and this booking is within all the parameters for each individual  and they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking of course they 're all trained to work in warehouses you can select as many of them as you want they
 're from multiple agencies it 's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking  and it 's monitoring their reliability the people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones they 're likely to be more expensive 
  people in how to do street interviewing  and they 've got a new campaign they want to run it next week  and they 're looking at how many of the people they 've inducted are available each hour next week  and they 'll then decide when to do their street interviews 
 but is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market  because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get 
 let 's make it
 personal  imagine that a young woman base of the economic pyramid  very little prospect of getting a job
 what economic activity could she theoretically engage in well she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center in a reception area in a mail room 
 she may be interested in providing local services to her community babysitting local deliveries
  she may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesn 't need them so she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out 
 she might have a bike a video games console she only uses occasionally  
 and you 're probably thinking
 because you 're all very web aware yes and we 're in the era of collaborative consumption so she can go online and do all this she can go to airbnb to list her sofa bed she can go to taskrabbit com
  i want to do local deliveries and so on these are good sites  
 but i believe we can go a step further and the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all 
 markets have changed beyond recognition in the last twenty years  but only for organizations at the top of the economy  
 if you 're a wall street trader you now take it for granted that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets that identifies the
  most profitable opportunities for you in real time  executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you 've set it analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave 
  of opportunities are coming from  it manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways  it 's all extremely low overhead 
  in terms of markets in the last twenty years
 basically
 classified adverts with a search facility  
 so why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading 
 and what the rest of us have
  a modern market is more than a website it 's a web of interoperable marketplaces  back office mechanisms regulatory regimes settlement mechanisms 
 liquidity sources and so on 
 and when a wall street trader comes into work in the morning she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today and then post that listing on multiple 
  websites and wait for potential buyers to get in touch and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade
 in the early days of this modern markets technology the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power their back office processes their relationships 
 their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity 
  but throughout the economy there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us 
 and those facilities i 'm talking about things like
 the mechanisms that prove our identity the licensing authorities that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time the processes by which we resolve
 disputes through official channels 
 these mechanisms these facilities are not in the gift of craigslist or gumtree or yahoo  they 're controlled by the state 
 and the policymakers who sit on top of them
 are i suggest simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used to underpin a whole new era of markets 
 like everyone else those policymakers are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of
  organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves  
 suppose we stopped taking that for granted 
 suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of britain or the president of the u s or the leader of any other developed nation  
 woke up and said i 'm never going to be able to create all the jobs i need in the current climate i have got to focus on whatever
  economic opportunity i can get to my citizens and for that they have to be able to access state of the art markets how do i make that happen 
 and i think i can see a few eyes rolling 
 politicians in a big complex sophisticated i t project oh that 's going to be a disaster waiting to happen 
  that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful 
 national lotteries 
 let 's take britain as an example  our government didn 't design the national lottery it didn 't fund the national lottery it doesn 't operate the national lottery it simply passed the national lottery act and this is what followed 
 this act defines what a national lottery will look like it
  specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators  and it puts some obligations on those operators 
 in terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses this was an unqualified success  
 but let 's suppose that our aim is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid could we use the same
  i believe we could 
 so imagine that policymakers outlined a facility  let 's call it national e markets nems for short think of it as a regulated public utility 
 so it 's on a par with the water supply or the road network  and it 's a series of markets for low level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company  
  markets to buy public services at the local level  it 's about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land it 's about enshrining government 's role as a publicist for these markets
 it 's about deregulating some sectors so that local people can enter them so  taxi journeys might be one example  and there are certain
 obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators
  key one is of course that the operators pay for everything including all the interfacing into the public sector  
 so imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction imagine that there 's a concession period
 defined of maybe fifteen years
 in which they
  take all these benefits and run with them
 and imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal  
 so government then exits the frame this is now in the hands of the consortium either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity and make a percentage on all of it or it 's all going to crash and burn which is tough on their shareholders it doesn 't bother
  and there would be no
 no constraints on alternative markets  so this would just be one more choice among millions of internet forums  
 but it could be very different 
 because having access to those state backed facilities could incentivize this consortium to seriously invest in the service because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions
  going to start making their return so we 're talking about sectors like home hair care
  the hire of toys  farm work
  hire of clothes even  meals delivered to your door services for tourists home care 
 this would be a world of very small trades but very
  potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market and they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market they 'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents who wanted a pool 
  of babysitters is it worth their while  should they be looking at other sectors should they be moving to another part of the country where there 's a
  and this data can be used by investors so if there 's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training 
 an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years 
 this is a world of atomized capitalism so it 's small trades by small people  but it 's very informed
  could unlock around one hundred million pounds ' worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the u k does that sound improbable to you 
 that 's what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges twenty years ago 
 do not underestimate the transformative power of truly modern markets
