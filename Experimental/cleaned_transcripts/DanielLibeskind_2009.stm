  start with my favorite muse  emily dickinson who said that
 wonder is not knowledge neither is it ignorance  it 's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be and a tradition we may have forgotten
 when i listen to these incredible people here i 've been so inspired so many incredible ideas so many visions  and yet when i look at the environment outside 
 you see how resistant architecture is to change you see how resistant it is to those very ideas we can think them out we can create incredible things and yet at the end  it 's so hard to change a wall we applaud the well mannered
  to create a space that never existed is what interests me to create something that has never been 
 a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits  and i think that 's really what architecture is based on architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil 
  it 's based on wonder and that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities  the greatest spaces that we have had and i think that is indeed what architecture is it is a story 
  is told through its hard materials  but it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities if you think of the great buildings of the cathedrals of the temples of the 
  pyramids  of pagodas of cities in india and beyond you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea  but by people so anything that has been made can be unmade anything that has been made can be made better
  it is the things that i really believe are of important architecture these are the dimensions that i like to work with it 's something very personal  it 's not perhaps the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners  but i think these are the necessary
 oxygen for us to live in buildings to live in cities to connect ourselves in a social space  and i therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward it 's the only profession
  where you have to believe in the future you can be a general  a politician  an economist who is depressed a musician in a minor key  a painter in dark colors  but architecture is 
 that complete ecstasy that the future can be better  and it is that belief that i think drives society and today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us and yet it is in times like this that i think architecture can thrive with big ideas
 ideas that are not small think of the great cities think of the empire state building the rockefeller center they were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way and yet 
 that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy so again i am a believer in the
  never been a fan of the neutral i don 't like neutrality in life in anything  i think expression and it 's like espresso coffee you know you take the essence of the coffee 
 that 's what expression is it 's been missing in much of the architecture because we we think architecture is the realm of the neutered the realm of the kind of a state that
  has no opinion that has no value  and yet  i believe it is the expression expression of the city expression of our own space that gives meaning to
  architecture and of course  expressive spaces are not mute expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know  expressive spaces may disturb us  and i 
  think that 's also part of life life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile  but to reach out across the abyss of history to places we have never been and would have 
 perhaps been had we not been so lucky so again radical versus conservative
  radical what does it mean  it 's something which is rooted 
 and something which is rooted deep in a tradition and i think that is what architecture is  it 's radical it 's not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms  it is actually a living 
 connection to the cosmic event that we are part of and a story that is certainly ongoing  it 's not something that
  has a good ending or a bad ending it 's actually a story
 in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way so again i am a believer in the radical architecture  you know the soviet architecture
 of that building is the conservation it 's like the old las vegas used to be  it 's about conserving emotions conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward
  and of course what is radical is to confront them  and i think our architecture is a confrontation with our own
  there is a lot of
 appreciation for the kind of cool architecture  i 've always been an opponent of it i think emotion is needed life without emotion would really not be life
  even the mind is emotional  there is no reason which does not take a position in the ethical sphere in the philosophical mystery of what we are so i think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space into city life
  and of course we are all about the struggle of emotions  and i think that is what makes the world a wondrous place and
 of course the confrontation of the cool the unemotional with emotion is a conversation that i think cities themselves have fostered i think that is the progress of cities it 's not only the forms of cities  but the fact that they incarnate emotions
  not just of those who build them  but of those who live there as well 
 inexplicable versus understood you know too often we want to understand everything but architecture is not the language of words  it 's a language  but it is not a language that can be reduced 
 to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story  but the story is very short which says we have no story to tell you
  dimensions which might be totally inexplicable in words  because they operate in proportions  in materials  in light they connect themselves into various 
  sources into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn 't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives and in the history of a city
  and of a people so again the notion that a building should just be explicit
 i think is a false notion which has reduced architecture into banality hand versus the computer of course what would we be without computers our whole practice depends on computing  but 
 the computer should not just be the glove of the hand the hand should really be
  in all its physiological
 obscurity has a source  though the source is unknown  though we don 't have to be mystical about it we realize that the hand has been given us
 by forces that are beyond our own autonomy  and i think
 when i when i draw drawings which may imitate the computer  but are not computer drawings drawings that can come from sources that are completely not
  not seen yet the hand and that 's what i really to all of you who are working how can we make the computer
 respond to our hand rather than the hand responding to the computer  i think that 's part of what
 the complexity of architecture is  because
 certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda that the simple is the good  but i don 't believe it listening to all of you the complexity of thought  the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming  and i think
 we shouldn 't shy away in architecture you know  brain surgery atomic
 theory  
 genetics
  economics are complex complex fields  there is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple it is complex space is complex space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds  
 and as wondrous as it is it cannot be reduced to a kind
  simplification that we have often come to be admired  and yet our lives are complex our emotions are complex our intellectual desires are complex so i do believe that architecture as i see it
 needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have in every intimacy that we possess  of course that means that architecture is political 
 the political is not an enemy of architecture the politeama is the city it 's all of us
 and i 've always believed that the act of architecture even a private house when somebody else will see it is a political act because it will be visible to others and we live in a world which is connecting us more and more so again 
 the evasion of that sphere which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture  the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me  and i do believe that this
 interaction
 with the history with history that is often very difficult to grapple with it to create a
 position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique because architecture is also the asking of questions  it 's not only the giving of answers  it 's also just like life the asking of questions 
 therefore it is important that it be real  you know we can simulate almost anything  but the one thing that can be ever
  simulated is the human heart the human soul and architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere so the reality of architecture is 
  visceral  it 's not intellectual  it 's not something that comes to us from books and theories  
  the bed
 such prosaic objects and yet i try in every building to take that virtual world which is so enigmatic and so rich and create something in the real world create a space 
  for an office a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real 
  so the unexpected is always unexpected  you know it 's true the cathedrals as unexpected will always be unexpected you know frank gehry 's buildings they will continue to be unexpected in the future so
  not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability but an architecture that is full of tension an architecture that goes beyond itself 
 to reach a human soul and a human heart  and that breaks out of the shackles of habits  
  when we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles of those lights of those materials  we think the world really looks like our buildings  and yet 
  our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them so again the unexpected which is also the raw  and i often think of the raw and the refined what is raw  the raw i would say is the naked experience
  by luxury  untouched by expensive materials  untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with with high culture  so the rawness i think
 in space the fact that sustainability can can actually in the future translate into a raw space  a space that isn 't decorated  a space that is not mannered in any source  but a space that might be cool
 in terms of its
  temperature might be refractive to our desires  a space that
 doesn 't always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us  but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities other experiences 
 that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture and of course that juxtaposition
 is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new
  energy and so i do like something which is pointed not blunt something which is focused
 on reality something that has the power  through its leverage to transform even a very small space so architecture maybe is not so big like science but through its
 focal point it can leverage in an archimedian way what we think the world is really about and often it takes just a building to change
  our experience of what could be done what has been done how the world
 has remained both in between stability and instability and of course buildings have their shapes those shapes are difficult to change  and yet  i do believe that in 
  every social space  in every public space  there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought that blunt technique but something that pinpoints
 and can point in various directions
 forward backward sideways and around so that is indeed what is memory  so i believe that that my main interest is to memory  without 
  memory we would be amnesiacs we would not know which way we were going and why we are going where we 're going  
 interested in the forgettable
 reuse  rehashing of the same things over and over again  which of course get accolades of critics critics like
 the performance to be repeated again and again the same way but i rather play something
 completely unheard of and even with flaws than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness so again 
 memory is the city memory is
  the world without the memory there would be no story to tell there would be nowhere to turn the memorable i think is really our world what we think the world is and it 's not only our memory  but those who remember us 
 which means that architecture is not mute 
 it 's an art of communication it tells a story the story can reach into obscure
 desires it can reach into sources that are not explicitly available it can reach
  into millennia
 that have been buried  and return them in a just and unexpected equity  so again i think
 the notion that the best architecture is silent
 has never appealed to me  silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city cities should be full of vibrations  full of sound full of music  and that indeed is the architectural mission that i believe is important is to create
  that are vibrant that are pluralistic that can transform the most prosaic activities 
 and raise them to a completely different expectation create a shopping center a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment and these are our dreams  and of course risk 
 i think architecture should be risky  you know it costs a lot of money and so on but yes
  it should not play it safe it should not play it safe because if it
  it 's not moving us in a
 direction that we want to be  and i think of course risk is what underlies the world
 world without risk would not be worth living 
 so yes i do believe that the risk we take in every building  risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent
 risks of spaces that have never been so
 dizzying
  as they should be for a pioneering city  risks that really move architecture
 even with all its flaws into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of 
 and of course that is finally what i believe architecture to be  it 's about space it 's not about fashion  it 's not about decoration  it 's about creating with minimal means something which can
  be repeated cannot be simulated in any other sphere  and there of course is the space that we need to breathe is the space we need to dream 
 these are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us  but are important for everybody in this world so again  it 's not about the changing fashions changing 
  theories  it 's about carving out a space for trees it 's carving out a space where nature can
  and i think that is
  those buildings so democracy as difficult as it is i believe in it and of course at ground zero what else  it 's such a complex project it 's emotional  there is so many interests 
 it 's political  there is so many parties to this project  there is so many interests there 's money there 's political power there are emotions of the victims  
  all its difficulties  i would not have liked somebody to say this is the tabula rasa mister architect do whatever you want i think nothing good will come out of out of that i think architecture is about consensus  and 
  it is about the dirty word compromise compromise is not bad  compromise  if it 's artistic  if it is able to cope with its strategies and there is my first sketch and the last rendering it 's not that far away and yet  compromise
  is what i believe in and ground zero despite all its difficulties  it 's moving forward  it 's difficult  two thousand and eleven  
 two thousand and thirteen freedom tower  the memorial  
 and that is where i end  i was inspired when i came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others looking at america from that point of view 
 this is america this is liberty this is what we dream about its individuality  demonstrated
  have you come to to peace with the process that happened at ground zero and the loss of the original incredible design that you came up with daniel libeskind look
  we have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian that we can determine everything that happens  we have to rely on others  and shape the process in the best way possible 
 i came from the bronx  i was taught not to be a loser not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight you have to fight for what you believe you don 't always win everything you you want to win 
 but you can steer the process and i believe that what will be built at ground zero will be meaningful will be inspiring will tell other generations of the sacrifices of the meaning of this event not just for new york  but for the world
