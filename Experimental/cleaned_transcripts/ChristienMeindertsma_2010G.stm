  i would like to start my talk with actually two questions and the first one is how many people here actually eat pig meat please raise your hand oh that 's
 a lot and how many people
  have actually seen a live pig producing this meat in the last year
  in the netherlands where i come from you actually never see a pig which is really strange because on a population of sixteen million people we have twelve million pigs 
 and well of course the dutch can 't eat all these pigs they eat about one third and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in europe and the rest of the world a lot goes to the
  and what i was curious about because historically the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted and i was curious
 to find out if this was actually still the case 
 and i spent about three years researching  and i followed this one pig with number five thousand and forty nine all the way up until the end
 and to what products it 's made of and
 in these years i met all kinds people like for instance farmers and butchers which seems logical  but i also met aluminum mold makers
 ammunition producers and
 all kinds of people  and what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs  but
 the consumers as in us had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products so what i did is  i took all this research
  made it into a
 well  basically it 's a product catalog of this one pig and it carries
 a duplicate of his ear tag on the back and it consists of seven chapters
 the chapters are skin bones meat internal organs blood fat
 and miscellaneous in total  they weigh one hundred and three point seven kilograms and
 to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day  i want to show you some
  images of the book you probably start the day with a shower so in soap fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat
 are used as a hardening agent but also for giving it a pearl like effect
 then if you look around you in the bathroom you see lots more products like shampoo conditioner
 you 've already met the pig so many times  then at breakfast  the pig that i followed the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig
 were used as an improver of dough
  what they do is they put gelatin back in in order to retain the
 texture  well  when you 're off to work under the road or under the buildings that you see there might very well be cellular concrete which is a very light kind of concrete
 that 's actually got proteins from bones inside and it 's also fully reusable in the train brakes at least in the german train brakes there 's this
 part of the brake that 's made of bone ash
 and in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts like chocolate mousse tiramisu vanilla pudding everything that 's cooled in the supermarket there 's gelatin to make it look good 
 fine bone china this is a real classic of course the bone in fine bone china
 gives it its translucency and also its strength  in order to make these really fine
  like this deer  in interior decorating the pig 's actually quite
 there it 's used in paint
 for the texture but also for the glossiness  in sandpaper bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper 
 and then in paintbrushes hairs are used because apparently they 're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature 
  i was not planning on showing you any meat because of course half the book 's meat and you probably all know what meats they are but i didn 't want you to miss out on this one because this 
 well it 's called portion controlled meat cuts and
 this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket  
 and what it is it 's actually steak so this is sold as cow but what happens when you slaughter a cow at least in industrial
 factory farming
  they have all these little bits of steak left that they can 't actually sell as steak so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage 
 then freeze the sausage  cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again 
 and
 this also actually happens with tuna and scallops 
 so with the steak you might drink a beer in the
 brewing process there 's lots of cloudy elements in the beer so to get rid of these cloudy elements what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that
 cloudiness this actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice 
 there 's actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter and according to them this creates an artificial lung in the filter
 this is actually a healthier cigarette 
 injectable collagen or since the ' 70s collagen from pigs has been used for injecting into wrinkles and the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings so the collagen is as well 
 well this must be the strangest thing i found this is
 a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states and
  while i was making the book i contacted all the producers of products because i wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens so
 i sent this company an email saying hello i 'm christien i 'm doing this research and
 can you send me a bullet and well  i didn 't expect them to even answer my email but they answered and
  you for your email what an interesting story are you in anyway related to the dutch government i
 thought that was really weird as if the dutch government sends emails to anyone 
 so the most beautiful thing i found at least what i think is the most beautiful in the book is
 this heart valve it 's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time 
 the low tech bit is that it 's literally a pig 's heart valve mounted in the
  is a memory metal casing and
 what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery 
 and once it 's in the right spot they remove the outer shell and the heart valve  
 well it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating instantly it 's really a sort of magical moment
  so this is actually a dutch company so
 i called them up and i asked can i borrow a heart valve from you
 and the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic so they were like okay we 'll put it in a jar for you with formalin and you can borrow it great
 and then i didn 't hear from from them for weeks  so
 i called and i asked what 's going on with the heart valve and they said well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart
  the last product from the book that i 'm showing you is renewable energy actually to show that my first question if pigs are still used up until the last bit was still true well it is because everything that can 't be used for anything else
 is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source  
  what they showed me is that well  firstly it 's at least to say odd that we don 't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens  and
 the second is that we actually don 't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of  and
 you might think i 'm very fond of pigs but actually well i am a little bit but i 'm more fond of of raw materials in general and i think that
 in order to take better care of what 's behind our products so the livestock the crops the plants 
 the non renewable materials but also the people that produce these products
 the first step would actually be to know that they are there  thank you
