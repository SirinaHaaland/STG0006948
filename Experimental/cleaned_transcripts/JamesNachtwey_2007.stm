  as someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible
 standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out of body experience and a deer caught in the headlights 
 so please forgive me for violating one of the ted commandments by relying on words on paper
  and i only hope i 'm not struck by lightning bolts before i 'm done i 'd
 like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer 
 i was a student in the ' 60s a time of social upheaval and questioning and on on a personal level an awakening
  sense of idealism the war in vietnam was raging the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me 
 our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another  
 i believed the photographers  and so did millions of other americans 
 their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism they not
  only recorded history they helped change the course of history 
 their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience 
 change became not only possible but inevitable  
 i saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism specifically visual journalism can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of
  adding momentum to success
  in the face of poor political judgment or political inaction it
 becomes a kind of intervention  assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior 
 it puts a human face on issues which from afar
 can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact what happens at ground level
  far from the halls of power  happens to ordinary citizens one by one  
 and i understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view 
 it gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice  and as a reaction it stimulates public opinion and gives
  impetus to public debate  thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda much as they would like to 
 coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly  
 the press is certainly a business  and in order to survive it must
 be a successful business
  but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility  
 society 's problems can 't be solved until they 're identified 
 on a higher plane  the press is a service industry and the service it provides is awareness
  every story does not have to sell something there 's also a time to give 
 that was a tradition i wanted to follow  seeing the war created such
  high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution
 i wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer  but i was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war
 would almost by definition be an 
  like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues i 've been involved in over the past twenty five years 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one i went to northern ireland  
 ten ira prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail  
 the reaction on the streets was violent confrontation  
 i saw that the
 front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields but right where people live 
 during the early ' 80s i spent a lot of time in central america which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the cold war 
 in guatemala the central government controlled by a oligarchy of european decent was waging a scorched earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion  
 and i saw an image that reflected the history of latin america
  conquest through a combination of the bible and the sword an 
  guerrilla was mortally wounded as commander zero attacked a town in southern nicaragua  
 a destroyed tank belonging to somoza 's national guard
 was left as a monument in a park in managua and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child at the same
  time a civil war was taking place in el salvador and again the civilian population was caught up in the conflict  i 've been covering the 
  conflict since one thousand nine  hundred and eighty one 
 this is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada in two thousand when it was still stones and molotovs against an army  
 in two thousand and one the uprising escalated
  into an armed conflict and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the palestinian refugee camp in the west bank town of jenin 
 without the political will to find common ground the continual friction of tactic and 
 only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance and perpetuates the cycle of violence
  in the ' 90s after the breakup of the soviet union yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines and civil war broke out between bosnia croatia and serbia  
 this is a scene of house to house fighting in mostar  neighbor against neighbor 
 a bedroom the place where people share intimacy where life itself is conceived became a battlefield
  a mosque in northern bosnia was destroyed by serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue 
 dead serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or bosnian soldiers killed in action 
 this was once a
  park the bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now 
 at the same time in south africa after nelson mandela had been released from prison 
 the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid 
 one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger  i had to use it
  channel its energy  turn it into something that would clarify my vision instead of clouding it 
 in transkei i witnessed a rite of passage into manhood of the xhosa tribe  
 teenage boys lived in isolation their bodies covered with white clay  after several weeks they washed off the white and took on
  a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of south africa  
 children in soweto playing on a trampoline  
 elsewhere in africa there was famine  in somalia the central government collapsed and clan
 warfare broke out farmers were driven off their land
 and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen  starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction
 primitive but extremely effective 
 hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated  slowly and painfully  
 the international community responded with massive humanitarian
  and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved  
 american troops were sent to protect the relief shipments but they were eventually drawn into the conflict  
 and after the tragic battle in mogadishu they were withdrawn 
 in southern sudan another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide  
 again international ngos united under the umbrella of the u n staged a massive relief operation
 and thousands of lives were saved
 i 'm a witness  and i want my testimony to be honest and uncensored 
 i also want it to be powerful and eloquent and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people i 'm photographing  
 this man was in an ngo feeding center being helped as much as he could be helped he literally had nothing he was a
  virtual skeleton  yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move 
 he had not given up and if he didn 't give up how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope 
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four after three months of covering the south african election  i saw the inauguration of nelson mandela  
 and it was the most uplifting thing i 've ever seen
  it exemplified the best that humanity has to offer 
 the next day i left for rwanda  and it was like taking the express elevator to hell  
 this man had just been liberated from a hutu death camp he allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time  and he even turned his
 face toward the light as if he wanted me to see him better  i think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world 
 this time maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in somalia  the international community remained silent  
 and somewhere around eight hundred thousand people were slaughtered by their own countrymen sometimes their own neighbors using farm implements as weapons  
 perhaps because a lesson had
  been learned by the weak response to the war in bosnia
 and the failure in rwanda  
 when serbia attacked kosovo international action was taken much more decisively  
 nato forces went in and the serbian army withdrew  
 ethnic albanians had been murdered their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported  they were received in
  refugee camps set up by ngos in albania and macedonia  
 the imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home  
 the image reminded me of a cave painting  and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways 
 between one thousand nine hundred and
  i covered the first two wars in chechnya from inside grozny  this is a chechen rebel on the front line against the russian army  
 the russians bombarded grozny constantly for weeks  killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside 
 i found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line
  my work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well 
 after the fall of ceausescu i went to romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children 
 where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions 
 ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family thereby making women 's bodies an instrument of state economic policy
  children who couldn 't be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages  
 children with birth defects were labeled incurables  and confined for life to inhuman conditions 
 as reports began to surface again international aid went in 
 going deeper into the legacy of the eastern european regimes i worked for several months on a story about the effects of
  industrial pollution where there had been no regard for the environment
 or the health of either workers or the general population 
 an aluminum factory in czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust 
 and four out of five workers came down with cancer 
  the fall of suharto in indonesia  i began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization 
 i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment
 and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident 
 when the story was published  unsolicited donations poured in a trust fund was established and the family now lives in a house in the countryside
 and all their basic necessities are taken care of
 it was a story that wasn 't trying to sell anything 
 journalism had provided a channel for people 's natural sense of generosity  and the readers responded 
 i met a band of homeless children who 'd come to jakarta from the countryside and ended up living in a train station by the age of twelve
  they 'd become beggars and drug addicts the rural poor had become the urban poor and in the process they 'd become invisible 
 these heroin addicts in detox in pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by beckett 
 isolated waiting in the dark  but drawn to the light  
 agent orange was a defoliant used during the vietnam war to deny cover to the vietcong and the north
  vietnamese army  
 the active ingredient was dioxin  
 an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation
 in two thousand i began documenting global health issues concentrating first on aids in africa  
 i tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers  
 i thought it was important to
  emphasize that people were being helped  whether by international ngos or by local grassroots organizations 
 so many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents 
 and a lot of children had been born with hiv  
 a hospital in zambia  
 i began documenting the close connection between hiv aids
 and tuberculosis  this is an msf hospital in cambodia 
 my pictures can play a supporting role to the work of ngos by shedding light on the critical social problems they 're trying to deal with 
 i went to congo with msf and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war
  in which millions of people have died and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon 
 a malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program 
 in the fall of two thousand and four i went to darfur  this time i was on assignment for a magazine but again worked closely
  the international community still hasn 't found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide  
 an msf hospital in a camp for displaced people 
 i 've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in america  this is a scene from new orleans  
 a prisoner on a chain gang in alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday
  sun 
 this experience raised a lot of questions  among them questions about race and equality
 and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available in the yard of a chain gang in alabama 
 i didn 't see either of the planes hit and when i glanced out my window i saw the first tower burning
  i thought it might have been an accident
 a few minutes later when i looked again and saw the second tower burning  i knew we were at war 
 in the midst of the wreckage at ground zero i had a realization i 'd been photographing in the islamic world since 
 not only in the middle east but also in africa asia and europe at the time i was photographing in these different places i thought i
  was covering separate stories but on nine eleven history crystallized  
 and i understood i 'd actually been covering a single story for more than twenty years  
 and the attack on new york was its latest manifestation  
 the central commercial district of kabul afghanistan at the end of the civil war shortly before the city fell to the taliban
  mine victims being helped at the red cross rehab center being run by alberto cairo 
 a boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine  
 i 'd witnessed immense suffering in the islamic world from political oppression civil war foreign invasions poverty famine i understood that in its
  the islamic world had been crying out why weren 't we listening  
 a taliban fighter shot during a battle as the northern alliance entered the city of kunduz  
 when war with iraq was imminent i realized the american troops would be very well covered so i decided to cover the invasion from inside baghdad
 a marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family  
 a day after american forces entered baghdad a company of marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds
 a hopeful moment that was short lived 
 for the first time in years shi 'ites
  were allowed to make the pilgrimage to karbala to observe ashura  
 and i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion 
 a group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives 
 it was obvious that the shi 'ites were a force to be reckoned with 
 and we would do well to understand them
 and learn how to deal with them
 last year i spent several months documenting our wounded troops from the battlefield in iraq all the way home  
 this is a helicopter medic giving cpr to a soldier who had been shot in the head 
 military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history
 the signature weapon of the war is the ied and the signature wound is severe leg damage 
 after enduring extreme pain and trauma  
 the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab 
  the spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable  i tried to imagine myself in their place and i was totally humbled by their courage and determination
 in the face of such catastrophic loss  good people had been put in a very bad situation
 for questionable results 
 one day in rehab someone started talking about surfing and all these guys who 'd never surfed before said hey let 's go
  they went surfing 
 photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what 's going on 
 sometimes they put their lives on the line because they believe your opinions and your influence matter 
 they aim their pictures at your best
  a sense of right and wrong the ability and the willingness to identify with others  the refusal to accept the unacceptable 
 my ted wish 
 there 's a vital story that needs to be told  and i wish for ted to help me gain access to it
 and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting
  ways to use news photography in the digital era  thank you very much
