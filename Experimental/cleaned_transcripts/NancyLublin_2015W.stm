  a girl i 've never met before changed my life and the life of thousands of other people i 'm the ceo of 
 it 's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people in fact it 's bigger than the boy scouts in the united states
  we 're not homophobic 
 and it 's true the way we communicate with young people is by text because that 's how young people communicate 
 so we 'll run over two hundred campaigns this year things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries 
 or making valentine 's day cards for senior citizens who are homebound and we 'll text them and we 'll have a
 ninety seven percent open rate it 'll over index hispanic and urban we collected two hundred thousand jars of peanut butter and over three 
  hundred and sixty five thousand valentine 's day cards this is big scale ok 
 but there 's one weird side
  every time we send out a text message we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter or hunger or senior citizens
 but text messages about being bullied text messages about being addicted to pot 
 and the worst message we ever got
 said exactly this he won 't stop raping me it 's my dad  he told me not to tell anyone
  are you there 
 we couldn 't believe this was happening we couldn 't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being and that she would share it with us
 something so intimate so personal  
 and we realized we had to stop triaging this and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain 
 so we launched crisis text line
 very quietly in chicago and el paso just a few thousand people in each market 
 and in four months  we were in all two hundred and ninety five area codes in america just to put that into perspective that 's zero marketing and faster growth than when facebook first launched 
 text is unbelievably private no one hears you talking
  so we spike everyday at lunch time kids are sitting at the lunch table and you think that she 's texting the cute boy across the hall but she 's actually texting us about her bulimia  
 and we don 't get the word like or um or hyperventilating or crying we just get facts  
 we get things like i want to die
  i have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me and so the crisis counselor says how about you put those pills in the drawer while we text 
 and they go back and forth for a while and the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address because if you 're texting a text line you want help 
 so she gets the address and the counselor triggers an active rescue while they 're texting back and forth 
  with no response from this girl and the next message that comes in says
 it 's the mom i had no idea and i was in the house we 're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital 
 as a mom that one just
 the next message comes a month later i just got out of the hospital i was diagnosed as
  bipolar  and i think i 'm going to be ok
 i would love to tell you that that 's an unusual exchange but we 're doing on average two point four one active rescues a day thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression
 huge
  the beautiful thing about crisis text line is that these are strangers counseling other strangers on the most intimate
 issues  and getting them from hot moments to cold moments it 's exciting and i will tell you that we have done a total of more than six point five million text messages 
  in less than two years but
 the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this the thing that really gets me psyched is the data
 six point five million messages that 's the volume  velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus we can do things like predictive 
  work we can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set 
  chances are someone here someone watching this has seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life you do not have to raise your hand 
 how do you know that person 's any good  oh they have a degree from harvard on the wall are you sure he didn 't graduate in the bottom ten percent 
 when my husband and i saw a marriage counselor i thought she was a genius when she said i 'll see you guys in two weeks but i need to see you next week sir
  we have the data to know what makes a great counselor we know that if you text the words numbs and sleeve 
 there 's a ninety nine percent match for cutting 
 we know that if you text in the words mg and rubber band there 's a ninety nine percent match for substance abuse 
  you 're questioning if you 're gay  
 now that 's interesting information that a counselor could figure out but that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic  pop up says ninety nine percent match 
  for cutting try asking one of these questions to prompt the counselor or ninety nine percent match for substance abuse here are three drug clinics near the texter
  us more accurate 
 on the day that robin williams committed suicide people flooded hotlines all over this country it was sad to see an icon a funnyman commit suicide 
 and there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country  we had a spike in volume also 
  i want to kill myself the algorithm reads that you 're code orange and you become number one in the queue  so we can handle severity 
 not chronological 
 this data is also making the world better because i 'm sitting on
 the world 's first map of real time crises think
  those six point five million messages auto tagging through natural language processes all of these data points i can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders  
 monday 
 the worst time of day for substance abuse 5am 
 and that montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there  because it is the number one state for suicidal
  and we 've made this data public and free and open we 've pulled all the personally identifiable information  and it 's in a place called 
 i want schools to be able to see that monday is the worst day for eating disorders  so that they can plan meals and guidance counselors to be there on mondays  and i want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at
  take care of those native american reservations in montana 
 data  evidence
 makes policy research  journalism  policing school boards everything better 
 i don 't think of myself as a mental health activist i think of myself as a
  i get really excited about this data i 'm a little nerdy  yeah that sounded too girly i 'm nerdy 
 i love data  and the only difference really between me
 and those people in hoodies down the road with their fat funded companies 
 is that i 'm not inspired by helping you find chinese food at 2am in dallas or helping you
 touch your wrist and
  get a car immediately  or swipe right and get laid i 'm inspired 
 i want to use tech and data
 to make the world a better place i want to use it to help that girl who texted in about being raped by her father  because the truth is we never heard from her again  
 and i hope that she is somewhere safe
 and healthy  and i hope that she sees this talk
 and she knows that her desperation and her courage inspired the creation of crisis text line and inspires me every freaking day
