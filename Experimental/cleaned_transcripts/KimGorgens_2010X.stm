  a funny thing happened on my way to becoming
 a brilliant  world class neuropsychologist  i had a baby  and that 's not to say i ever went on to become a brilliant
  did go on to be a reasonably astute  arguably world class worrier  
 one of my girlfriends in graduate school marie said kim i figured it out  
 it 's not that you 're more neurotic than everyone else it 's just that you 're more honest about how neurotic you are so in the spirit of full
  of water and then finally all suited up for the  90 minute drive to copper mountain so
 you can get kind of a feel for this 
 so my baby vander is eight years old now  and 
 despite being cursed with my athletic inability he plays soccer 
 he 's interested in playing football he wants to learn how to ride a unicycle so why would i worry 
 because this is what i do this is what i teach it 's what i study it 's what i treat and i know
  know that kids get concussed every year 
 in fact more than four million people sustain a concussion every year and these data are just among kids under fourteen who were seen in emergency rooms 
 and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung but what is it that we 're really talking about
  a car accident forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier thirty five gs 
 a heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face
  one hundred and three gs  the average concussive impact is ninety five gs  
 now when the kid on the right doesn 't get up we know they 've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know
 if he or she has sustained a concussion how do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play  cleared for return to
  play applies to them 
 the definition of concussion doesn 't actually require a loss of consciousness  
 it requires only a change in consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including
 feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear  being more impulsive or hostile than usual 
 so given all of that and given how darn neurotic i am  how do i get any
  sleep at all because i know our brains are resilient 
 they 're designed to recover from an injury  if god forbid
 any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion  most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks 
 but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact
  three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries
 relative even to their   college age peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline  
 after that first injury their risk for second injury is exponentially greater from there  their risk for a third
  and so on 
 and here 's the really alarming part we don 't fully understand the  long term impact of multiple injuries 
 you guys may be familiar with this research that 's coming out of the nfl 
 in a nutshell this research suggests that among retired nfl players with three or more career concussions
  dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population  
 so you 've all seen that new york times you 've seen it what you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by nfl wives who said 
 isn 't it weird that my 46 year old husband is forever losing his keys
  losing his way home in the car from the driveway 
 i may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child 
 so it 's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around
 someday so how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can
  we one hundred percent guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what i 've come up with 
 if only 
 my little boy 's right there and he 's like she 's not kidding  she 's totally not kidding 
 so
  should my kid play football  should your kid play football i don 't know but i do know there are three things you can do 
 the first study up 
 you have to be familiar with the issues we 're talking about today 
 there are some great resources out there the cdc has a program heads up it 's
 at cdc gov heads up is specific to concussion in kids 
 the second is a resource i 'm personally really proud of
  just rolled this out in the last couple months co kids with brain injury  
 this is a great resource for student athletes  teachers parents professionals 
 athletic and coaching staff  it 's a great place to start if you have questions 
 the second thing is speak up 
 just two weeks ago a bill introduced by senator kefalas that would have required athletes
 under eighteen to wear a helmet when they 're riding their bike died in committee  
 it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy in it lacked stakeholder traction 
 now i 'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn 't support but i am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know that 
  up also with coaching staff  ask about what kind of protective equipment is available what 's the budget for protective equipment how old it is 
 maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear  which brings us to suit up wear a helmet 
 the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening
  one of my graduate students tom said kim i 've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class and
 tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g force of impact by half 
 now  i thought it was because i have this totally compelling
  this epiphany of tom 's 
 as it turns out it occurred to tom that a $ twenty helmet is a good way to protect a $ one hundred thousand graduate education 
 laughter so  
 should vander play football  i can 't say no but i can guarantee that every time he leaves the
  wearing a helmet
 like to the car or
 at school  
 so whether athlete scholar  overprotected kid neurotic mom  or otherwise here 's my baby vander reminding you to mind your matter
