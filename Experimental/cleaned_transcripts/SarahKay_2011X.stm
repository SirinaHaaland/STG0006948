  moon sees me the moon sees somebody that
 i don 't see god bless the moon and god bless me
 and god bless the somebody that i don 't see 
 if i get to heaven before you do i 'll make a hole
 and pull you through  and i 'll write your name on every star
  and that way the world
 won 't seem so far  the astronaut
 will not be at work today  
 he has called in sick  he has turned off his cell phone his laptop  his pager his alarm clock there is a fat yellow
  can be launched somewhere an electron flies off its energy cloud 
 a black hole has erupted a mother finishes setting the table for dinner a law & order marathon is starting  the astronaut is asleep  
 he has forgotten to turn off his watch  which ticks like a metal pulse against his wrist he does not hear it  
 he dreams of coral reefs and plankton his fingers find the pillowcase 's sailing masts
  he turns on his side opens his eyes at once he thinks that scuba divers must have the most wonderful job in the world so much water to glide through
  that you could only live one life  i don 't mean this metaphorically i mean i literally thought that i was going to get to do
 everything there was to do and be
 everything there was to be it was only a matter of time and there was no limitation based on age or gender or race or even
 appropriate time period i was sure that i was going to actually experience what it felt like to be
 a leader of the civil rights movement or a ten year old boy living on a farm during the dust bowl or an emperor of the tang dynasty in china 
 my mom says that when people asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up my typical response was
 and what she doesn 't understand is that i wasn 't trying to invent some combined super profession i was listing things i thought i
  gonna get to be a princess and a ballerina and an astronaut and i 'm pretty sure the list probably went on from there i usually just got cut off 
 it was never a question of if i was gonna get to do something so much of a question of when 
 and i was sure that if i was going to do everything that it probably meant i had to move pretty quickly because there was a lot of stuff i needed to do so my life was constantly in a state of rushing i was always scared that i was falling
  behind and since i grew up in new york city as far as i could tell rushing was pretty normal  
 but as i grew up i had this sinking realization that i wasn 't gonna get to live
 any more than one life i only knew what it felt like to be a teenage girl in new york city not a teenage boy in new zealand not a prom queen
 in kansas
  i only got to see through my lens and it was around this time that i became obsessed with stories because it was through stories that i was able to see through someone else 's lens however 
 briefly or imperfectly  and i started craving hearing other people 's experiences because i was so jealous that there were entire lives that i was never gonna get to live and i wanted to hear about everything that i was missing  
  that some people were never gonna get to experience what it felt like to be a teenage girl in new york city  which meant that they weren 't gonna know what
 the subway ride after your first kiss feels like or how quiet it gets when its snows  
 and i wanted them to know i wanted to tell them and this became the focus of my obsession i busied myself telling stories and sharing stories and collecting them
  realized that i can 't always
 rush
 poetry 
 in april for national poetry month there 's this challenge that many poets in the poetry community participate in and its called the thirty thirty challenge
 the idea is you write a new poem every single day for the entire month of april 
 and last year i tried it for the first time and was thrilled by the efficiency at which i was
  able to produce poetry but at the end of the month i looked back at these thirty poems i had written
 and discovered that they were all trying to tell the same story it had just taken me thirty tries to figure out the way that it wanted to be told and i realized that this is probably 
  true of other stories on an even larger scale i have stories that i have tried to tell for years rewriting and rewriting and constantly searching for the right words
  there 's a french poet and essayist by the name of paul  valry who said a poem is never finished it is only abandoned  and this terrifies me because it implies that i could keep re editing
  and rewriting forever and its up to me to decide when a poem is finished and when i can
  poetry in my life as a way to help me navigate and work through things but just because i end the poem doesn 't mean that i 've solved what it was i was puzzling through 
 i like to revisit old poetry because it shows me exactly where i was at that moment and what it was i was trying to navigate and the words that i chose to help me
  i have a story that i 've been stumbling over for years and years and i 'm not sure if i 've found the prefect form or whether this is just one attempt and i will try to rewrite it later in search of
 a better way to tell it but i do know that later when i look back
 i will be able to know that this is where i was at this moment and this is what i was trying to navigate with these words here in this room
  it didn 't always work this way 
 there 's a time you had to get your hands dirty  
 when you were in the dark for most of it fumbling was a given if you needed more contrast more saturation  
  and brighter brights they called it extended development it meant you spent longer inhaling chemicals longer up to your wrist  it wasn 't always easy  
 grandpa stewart was a navy photographer  young red faced with his sleeves rolled up  fists of fingers like fat rolls of coins he looked like popeye the sailor 
  man come to life  crooked smile  tuft of chest hair he showed up to world war ii with a smirk and a hobby  when they asked him if he knew much about photography 
 learned to read europe like a map upside down from the height of a fighter plane camera snapping eyelids flapping the darkest   darks and brightest brights he learned war like he could read his way home  
 when other men returned they would put their weapons out to rest but he brought the lenses and the cameras home with him
  opened a shop turned it into a family affair 
 my father was born into this world of black and white his basketball hands learned the tiny clicks and slides of lens into frame film into camera chemical into plastic bin his father knew the equipment
 but not the art he
 knew the  darks but not the brights my father learned the magic spent his time following light  once he traveled across the country to follow a forest fire  hunted it with his camera for a week
  follow the light he said 
 follow the light 
 there are parts of me i only recognize from photographs 
 the loft on wooster street with the creaky hallways the  twelve foot ceilings white walls and cold floors this was my mother 's home before she was mother before she was wife she was artist and the only two rooms in the house with walls that reached
  all the way up to the ceiling and doors that opened and closed were the bathroom
 and the darkroom 
 the darkroom she built herself with custom made stainless steel sinks an 8x10 bed enlarger that moved up and down by a giant hand crank a bank of 
  color balanced lights a white glass wall for viewing prints a drying rack that moved in and out from the wall my mother built herself a darkroom 
 made it her home  fell in love with a man with basketball hands with the way he looked at light  
 they got married
 had a baby moved to a house near a park  but they kept the loft on wooster street for birthday parties and treasure hunts the baby tipped the grayscale 
 filled her parents ' photo albums with red balloons and yellow icing the baby grew into a girl without freckles with a crooked smile  
  who never saw them hold hands 
 but one day another baby showed up this one with perfect straight hair and bubble gum cheeks they named him sweet potato when he laughed  he laughed so loudly he scared the pigeons on the fire escape and the four of them lived in that house near the park  
 the girl with no freckles  the sweet potato boy the basketball father and darkroom mother and they lit their candles and said their prayers and the corners of the photographs curled
 one day some towers fell 
 and the house near the park became a house under ash so they escaped in backpacks on bicycles to darkrooms but the loft of wooster street was built for an artist not
 a family of pigeons and walls that do not reach the ceiling do not hold in the yelling and the man with basketball hands put his weapons out to rest  
 he could not fight this war
  and no maps pointed home  his hands no longer fit his camera no longer fit his wife 's no longer fit his body  
 the sweet potato boy mashed his fists into his mouth until he had nothing more to say  so the girl without freckles went treasure hunting on her own  
 and on wooster street in a building with the creaky hallways and the loft with the 12 foot ceilings and the darkroom with too many sinks under the
 she found a note  tacked to the wall with a thumb tack left over from a time before towers from the time
 before babies and the note said a guy sure loves the girl who works in the darkroom 
 it was a year before my father picked up a camera again  his first time out he followed the
  dotting their way through new york city 's trees tiny dots of light blinking out at him from out of the darkest
 darks a year later he traveled across the country to follow a forest fire stayed for a week hunting it with his camera it was ravaging the west coast eating eating 
 18 wheeler trucks in its stride on the other side of the country  i went to class and wrote a poem in the margins of my notebook we have both learned the art of capture
