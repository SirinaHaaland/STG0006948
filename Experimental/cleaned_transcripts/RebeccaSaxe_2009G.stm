  today i 'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds  
 and the problem i 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy which is how can we know whether other people have minds 
 that is maybe you have a mind  and everyone else is just a really convincing robot 
  's a problem in philosophy but for today 's purposes
 i 'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind  
 and that i don 't have to worry about this there is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists 
 which is why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes or perhaps more relevantly why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes
  novelists put this best like philip roth who said 
 and yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people  
 so ill equipped are we all to envision one another 's interior workings and invisible aims 
 so as a teacher and as a spouse this is of course a problem i confront every day  but as a scientist i 'm interested in a different problem of other minds  and that is the one i 'm going to introduce to you today
  and that problem is how is it so easy to know other minds 
 so to start with an illustration 
 you need almost no information one snapshot of a stranger to guess what this woman is thinking or what this man is
  and put another way the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds our brain 
 is made up of pieces brain cells that we share with all other animals
  with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs  
 and yet you put them together in a particular network  and what you get is the capacity to write romeo and juliet 
 or to say as alan greenspan did 
 i know you think you understand what you thought i said  but i 'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what i meant 
  the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas one in each hand  
 and to try to understand how you can put together simple units simple messages over space and time in a network  
 and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds  
 so i 'm going to tell you three things about this today obviously the whole project here is huge and i 'm going to tell you just our first few steps
 about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about
  other people 's thoughts some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job  
 and then finally to show that some of the differences between people in how we judge others can be explained by differences in this brain system  
 so first the first thing i want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain in your brains whose job it is to think about other people 's thoughts
 it 's called the right temporo parietal junction it 's above and behind your right ear  and this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures i showed you or when you read romeo and juliet or when you tried to understand alan greenspan 
 and you don 't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems  
 so this brain region is called the right tpj and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults they 're mit undergraduates
 laughter the second thing i want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other 
  minds we weren 't always that way it takes children a long time to break into the system  i 'm going to show you a little bit of that long extended process 
  have beliefs that are different from their own  so i 'm going to show you a five year old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task rebecca saxe 
 this is the first pirate 
 his name is ivan and you know what pirates really like
  sandwiches 
 and ivan puts his sandwich over here 
 on top of the pirate chest  and ivan says you know what i need a drink with my lunch and so ivan goes to get a drink 
 and while ivan is away
 the wind comes
 and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass  and
  here comes the other pirate this pirate is called joshua
  and joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches so joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says yum yum yum yum yum  i love cheese sandwiches 
 and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest
  ivan comes back and he says i want my cheese sandwich so which one do you think ivan is going to take child i think he is going to
 take that one rs yeah you think he 's going to take that one all right let 's see oh yeah 
 you were right he took that one  
 so that 's a five year old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions now i 'm going to show you a  three year old who got the same puzzle
  ivan says i want my cheese sandwich which sandwich is he going to take do you
 think he 's going to take that one let 's see what happens  let 's see what he does here comes ivan and he says i want my cheese sandwich and he takes this one
 he predicts ivan will take the sandwich that 's really his  
 and second when he sees ivan taking the sandwich where he left his  where we would say he 's taking that one because he thinks it 's his 
 the three year old comes up with another explanation he 's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn 't want it because now it 's dirty on the ground  so that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich
  now of course development doesn 't end at five  and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people 's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now not for an action prediction  but for a moral judgment  
 so first i 'm going to show you the three year old again rs 
 so is ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah 
  so it 's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of ivan to take joshua 's sandwich  since he thinks ivan only took joshua 's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich  
 but now i 'm going to show you the five year old remember the  five year old completely understood why ivan took joshua 's sandwich rs was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child 
 um yeah  and so it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich
  because the wind should get in trouble he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches 
 and now what we 've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what 's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about 
  other people 's thoughts  so the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region the right tpj being used while children are thinking about
  other people  but it 's not quite like the adult brain 
 so whereas in the adults as i told you this brain region is almost completely specialized it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people 's thoughts
 in children it 's much less so when they are age five to eight  the age range of the children i just showed you 
 and actually if we even look at eight to 11 year olds getting into early adolescence they still don 't have quite an
 and so what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence  both the cognitive system  our mind 's ability to think about other minds  and the brain system that supports it are continuing slowly to develop  
 but of course as you 're probably aware even in adulthood  people differ from one another in how good they
  are at thinking of other minds how often they do it and how accurately  
 and so what we wanted to know was could differences among adults in how they think about other people 's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region  
 so the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids and i 'm going to give that to you now  
 so grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory and they take a break for coffee and grace 's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee 
 grace goes to make the coffee
  finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder which is sugar  
 but the powder is labeled deadly poison so grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison and she puts it in her friend 's coffee 
 and her friend drinks the coffee and is fine how many people think it was morally permissible for grace to put the powder in
  so we ask people how much should grace be blamed in this case which we call a failed attempt to harm  
 and we can compare that to another case where everything in the real world is the same the powder is still sugar  but what 's different is what grace thinks now she thinks the powder is sugar 
 and perhaps unsurprisingly if grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend 's coffee  people say she deserves no blame at all 
 whereas if she thinks the powder was poison
  even though it 's really sugar now people say she deserves a lot of blame even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same 
 and in fact they say she deserves more blame in this case  the failed attempt to harm  
 than in another case  
 which we call an accident where grace thought the powder was sugar because it was labeled sugar and by the coffee machine but actually the powder was poison  
 so even though when the powder was poison  the friend drank
 the coffee and died  people say grace deserves less blame in that case when she innocently thought it was sugar  than in the other case where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred 
 people though disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame grace should get in the accident case some people think she should deserve more blame
  and other people less and what i 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment  
 so what i 'm showing you from left to right is how much activity there was in this brain region  and from top to bottom how much blame people said that grace deserved  
 and what you can see is on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region  people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident  
 whereas on the right  where there was a lot of activity  people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief
  belief and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident  
 so that 's good but of course what we 'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region  and see if we could change people 's moral judgment  
 and we do have such a tool it 's called trans cranial magnetic stimulation or tms this is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody 's skull into a small region of their brain
  and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region  
 so i 'm going to show you a demo of this first i 'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse i 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine when you hear clicks we
 're turning the machine on 
 so now i 'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain
 to the part of my brain that controls my hand  so there is no physical force just a magnetic pulse woman ready rebecca rs 
 okay so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain  and we can use that same pulse 
  now applied to the rtpj to ask if we can change people 's moral judgments so these are the judgments i showed you before people 's normal moral judgments  
 and then we can apply tms to the rtpj and ask how people 's judgments change and the first thing is people can still do this task overall so their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same they say she deserves no blame 
 but in the case of a failed attempt to harm  where grace thought that it was poison  although it was really sugar  people now say it was more okay
  she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee 
 and in the case of the accident where she thought that it was sugar  but it was really poison and so she caused a death  
 people say that it was less okay she deserves more blame 
 so what i 've told you today is that
 people come actually especially well equipped to think about other people 's thoughts we have a special brain system
 that lets us think about what other people are thinking this system takes a long time to develop  slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence  
 and even in adulthood differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people  
 but i want to give the last word back to the novelists and to philip
  who ended by saying 
 the fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway it 's getting them wrong that is living getting them wrong and wrong and wrong 
 and then on careful reconsideration getting them wrong again
  magnetic pulses to change people 's moral judgments that sounds alarming 
 please tell me that you 're not taking phone calls from the pentagon
  where this work leads i mean you 're clearly an incredible human being but someone could take this knowledge and in some
 future not torture chamber do acts that people here might be worried about rs 
 yeah  we worry about this so there 's a couple of things to say about tms one is that you can 't be tmsed without knowing
  it 's not a surreptitious technology it 's quite hard actually to get those very small changes the changes i showed you are impressive
 to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain but they 're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make 
 and what we changed was not people 's moral judgments when they 're deciding what to do when they 're making action choices we changed their ability to judge other people 's actions  and so
 i think of what i 'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial but studying the jury ca 
 is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education to perhaps bring up a generation of kids
 able to make fairer moral judgments rs 
 that 's one of the idealistic hopes the whole research program here of studying the
 distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new  until recently what we knew about the brain were the things that
 any other animal 's brain could do too so we could study it in animal models we knew how brains see and how they control the body and how they hear and and sense  
 and the whole project of understanding
 how brains do the uniquely human things
 learn language and abstract concepts and thinking about other people 's thoughts that 's brand new and we don 't know yet what the implications will be of understanding it ca so i 've got one last question
 the hard problem of consciousness that puzzles a lot of people the notion that
 you can understand why a brain works perhaps but why does anyone have to feel anything why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for
 us to operate you 're a brilliant young neuroscientist i
  chances do you think there are that at some time in your
 career someone you or someone else is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem rs 
 i hope they do and i think they probably won 't ca why rs it 's
 not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing
