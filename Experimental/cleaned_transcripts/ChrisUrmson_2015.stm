  karl benz invented the automobile  later that year  he took it out for the first public test drive and true story
 crashed into a wall for the last one hundred and thirty years  we 've been working around that least reliable part of the car the driver
 we 've made the car stronger  
 we 've added seat belts  we 've added air bags and in the last decade  we 've actually started trying to make the car smarter to fix that bug  the driver now
 today i 'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully
  and what they can do for the world 
 i 'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does  
 but first i 'm going to talk a little bit about the problem  
 and it 's a big problem one point two million people are killed on the world 's roads every year in america alone thirty three thousand people are killed each year 
 to put that in perspective  that 's the same as a seven
  falling out of the sky every working day  it 's kind of unbelievable  
 cars are sold to us like this but really this is what driving 's like 
 right it 's not sunny  it 's rainy and you want to do anything other than drive 
 and the reason why is this traffic is getting worse in america between one thousand nine hundred and ninety and two thousand and ten the vehicle miles traveled
  we grew by six percent of roads  so it 's not in your brains traffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago  
 and all of this has a very human cost  
 so if you take the average commute time in america which is about fifty minutes you multiply that by the one hundred and twenty million workers we have 
 that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day
  let 's put it in perspective  
 you take that six billion minutes and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person  that turns out to be one hundred and sixty two lifetimes spent
 every day  wasted just getting from a to b it 's unbelievable  
 and then there are those of us who don 't have the privilege of sitting in traffic so this is steve he 's an incredibly
  he just happens to be blind  
 and that means instead of a 30 minute drive to work in the morning  it 's a two hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit or asking friends and family for a ride he doesn 't have that same freedom that you and i have to get around 
 we should do something about that 
 now conventional wisdom would say that we 'll just take these driver assistance systems and we 'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them and over time they 'll turn into
 well i 'm here to tell you that 's like me saying that if i work really hard at jumping one day i 'll be able to fly
  we actually need to do something a little different and so i 'm going to talk to you about three different ways that self driving systems are different than driver assistance systems 
 and i 'm going to start with some of our own experience so back in two thousand and thirteen  we had the first test of a self driving car where we let regular people use it
  well  almost regular they were one hundred googlers but they weren 't working on the project  
 and we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives  but unlike a real  self driving car this one had a big asterisk with it they had to pay attention because this was an experimental vehicle  we tested it a lot  
 but it could still fail  
  gave them two hours of training  we put them in the car we let them use it 
 and what we heard back was something awesome  as someone trying to bring a product into the world 
 every one of them told us they loved it in fact we had a porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day this is completely stupid what are we thinking
 but at the end of it he said not only should i have it everyone else should have it because people are terrible drivers 
 so this was music to our ears  but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing
  this was eye opening now my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes
 the battery is low  so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack
 pulls out his laptop  puts it on the seat  goes in the back again  digs around  pulls out the charging cable for
  puts it into the laptop puts it on the phone sure enough the phone is charging all the time he 's been doing sixty five miles per hour down the freeway 
 right unbelievable  
 so we thought about this and we said it 's kind of obvious right the better the technology gets the less reliable the driver is going to get so by just making the cars incrementally smarter we 're probably not going to see the wins we really need 
 let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here
  at this graph and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn 't you can ignore most of that axis because if you 're driving around town and the car starts stopping randomly you 're never going to buy that car 
 and the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it 's supposed to to help you avoid an accident  
 now if we look at the bottom left
  your classic car it doesn 't apply the brakes for you it doesn 't do anything goofy  but it also doesn 't get you out of an accident 
 now if we want to bring a driver assistance system into a car say with collision mitigation braking we 're going to put some package of technology on there and that 's this curve and it 's going to have some operating properties  but it 's never going to avoid all of the accidents because it doesn 't have that capability 
 but we 'll pick some place along the curve here and maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses and that 's amazing  right we just
  reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two there are now seventeen thousand less people dying every year in america  
 but if we want a self driving car 
 we need a technology curve that looks like this we 're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle and we
 'll pick some operating point up here where it basically never gets into a crash they 'll happen but very low frequency 
 now you and i could look at this and we could argue about whether it 's incremental and i could say something like
 80 20 rule and it 's really hard to move up to that new curve but let 's look at it from a different direction for a moment  
 so let 's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing and so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system 
 it turns out that human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every one hundred thousand miles in america 
 in contrast a
  system is probably making decisions about ten times per second so order of magnitude that 's about one thousand times per mile  
 so if you compare the distance between these two  it 's about ten to the eighth right  eight orders of magnitude  
 that 's like comparing how fast i run
 to the speed of light it doesn 't matter how hard i train i 'm never actually going to get there so there 's a pretty big
  gap there 
 and then finally there 's how the system can handle uncertainty  
 so this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road might not be i can 't tell nor can any of our algorithms  
 but in the case of a driver assistance system that means it can 't take action because again if it presses the brakes unexpectedly that 's completely
  system can look at that pedestrian and say i don 't know what they 're about to do slow down take a better look  and then react appropriately after that so it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be so that
 's enough about the differences between the two let 's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world 
 so this is our vehicle it starts by understanding where it is in the world by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning
  and then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment  so here all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road 
 and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist and up in the distance if you look really closely you can see some cones 
 then we know where the car is in the moment but we have to do better than that we have to predict what 's going to happen so here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed 
 so it needs to needs to get out of the way knowing that one pickup truck is great
  but we really need to know what everybody 's thinking so it becomes quite a complicated problem  
 and then given that we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment  so what trajectory it should follow how quickly it should slow down or speed up  
 and then that all turns into just following a path turning the steering wheel left or right  pressing the brake or gas
  really just two numbers at the end of the day  so how hard can it really be 
 back when we started in two thousand and nine this is what our system looked like so you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road driving down the highway 
 the car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are it 's really a geometric understanding of the world 
 once we started driving on neighborhood and city streets the problem becomes a whole new level of
  you see pedestrians crossing in front of us cars crossing in front of us going every which way the traffic lights crosswalks it 's an incredibly complicated problem by comparison  
 and then once you have that problem solved the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction so here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right  but not just construction in isolation of course  it has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well 
 and of course if anyone 's breaking
  the police are there and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car means that it 's not just a car it 's actually a police officer 
 similarly  the orange box on the side here  it 's a school bus  and we have to treat that differently as well  
 when we 're out on the road  other people have expectations so when a cyclist puts up their arm it means they 're expecting the car to yield to them and make room for them to make a lane change  
 and when a police officer stood in the road our vehicle should understand that this
  means stop and when they signal to go  we should continue 
 now the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles 
 the first most crude model of this is when one vehicle sees a construction zone having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty  
 but we actually have a much deeper understanding of this we could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time
  and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like 
 and then  even more importantly  we could take from that a model of how we expect them to move through the world  so here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us 
 here the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate that they 're going to nudge out and around the car to the right  
 here there 's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they 're going to continue
  to drive down the shape of the road  here somebody makes a right turn 
 and in a moment here somebody 's going to make a u turn in front of us and we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely  
 now that 's all well and good for things that we 've seen but of course you encounter lots of things that you haven 't seen in the world before  
 and so just a couple of months ago our vehicles were driving through mountain view
  and this is what we encountered this is a woman
 in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck
 in circles on the road 
 now it turns out there is nowhere in the dmv handbook that tells you how to deal with that 
 but our vehicles were able to encounter that slow down and drive safely 
 now we don 't have to deal with just ducks watch this bird fly across in front of us the car reacts to that here
 we 're dealing with a cyclist that you would never expect to see anywhere other than mountain view  
 and of course  we have to deal with drivers
  even the very small ones  
 watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us  
 and now  watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment 
 here as we make a lane change the car to our left decides it wants to as well 
 and here we watch a car blow through a red light
 and yield to it  and similarly here a cyclist blowing through that light as well and of course the vehicle responds safely  
 and of course we have people who do i don 't know what sometimes on the road like this guy pulling out between two self driving cars you have to ask what are you thinking 
 now i just fire hosed you with a lot of stuff there so i 'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly  so what we 're looking at is the scene with the cyclist
  again and you might notice in the bottom we can 't actually see the cyclist yet  but the car can it 's that little blue box up there and that comes from the laser data 
 and that 's not actually really easy to understand so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to turn that laser data and look at it  and if you 're really good at looking at laser data you can see a few dots on the curve there 
 right there and that blue box is that cyclist
  now as our light is red the cyclist 's light has turned yellow already and if you squint you can see that in the imagery  
 but the cyclist we see is going to proceed through the intersection 
 our light has now turned green his is solidly red and we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across 
 unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention they started to pull forward and fortunately for everyone this cyclists reacts avoids and makes it through the intersection
  and off we go  
 now as you can see we 've made some pretty exciting progress  and at this point we 're pretty convinced this technology is going to come to market we do three million miles of testing in our simulators
 every single day so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have 
 we are looking forward to having this technology on the road and we think the right path is to go through the  self driving rather than driver assistance approach because the urgency is
  so large  in the time i have given this talk today thirty four people have died on america 's roads 
 how soon can we bring it out well  it 's hard to say because it 's a really complicated problem  
 but these are my two boys my oldest son is eleven  and that means in four and a half years  he 's going to be able to get his
  i mean there 's a real debate going on out there right now so some of the companies for example
 are going the  driver assisted route what you 're saying is that that that 's kind of going to be a dead end because you can 't
 just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point and then a driver is going to say this feels safe and climb into the back and something ugly will happen cu right
  that 's exactly right and it 's not to say that the the
 driver assistance systems aren 't going to be incredibly valuable  they can save a lot of lives in the interim  
 but to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like steve get around to really get to the the end case in safety to have the opportunity to change our cities and move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots
  it 's the only way to go
