  these are the dark ages 
 and the dark ages are the time between when you put away the lego for the last time as a kid  and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid 's toy
  started out with my then 
  should buy the kid some lego that stuff 's cool walked into the lego store  bought him
 this it 's totally appropriate for a four year old i
 think the box says let 's see here eight
  turn to my wife and said who are we buying this for she 's like oh us i 'm like okay all right that 's cool pretty soon it got a little bit out of control 
 the dining room looked like this you walk there and it hurts
 so
 we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu ghraib annex
  funny wow you guys are great
 and we put down those little floor tiles and then i went onto ebay and bought one hundred and fifty pounds of lego laughter
 which is insane  my daughter the day we got it i was tucking her in and i said
  going to put all this so you go to the container store and spend an enormous amount of money  and then you start this crazy sorting process that never
 it 's just nuts
  whatever so then you realize there are these conventions and you go to one of these conventions and some dude built the titanic and you 're like holy shit he had to come in like a truck a semi with this thing 
 someone built this this is the smith tower in seattle just beautiful and there 's a dude selling these aftermarket
  the danish no they 're not into guns but the americans oh we 'll make some guns for lego no problem
 and at a certain point you look around you 're like whoa this is a really nerdy crowd 
 and i mean like like this is a nerdy crowd but that 's like a couple of levels above furries  
 the nerds here   they get laid
 except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket and you you say to yourself at some point  am i part of this group like
  into this and i was just like yeah i guess i am i 'm
 coming out i 'm kind of into this stuff and i 'm going to stop being embarrassed so then you really get into it and you 're like well the lego people in denmark they 've got all this software to let you build your your own virtually 
 and so this is like this cad program where you build it and then whatever you design virtually you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later  and then some of the designs that people do they actually
  sell in the store the lego guys don 't give you any royalties strangely but some user made this and then it sold and it 's it 's
 pretty amazing actually then you notice that if that  lego provided cad program isn 't enough there 's an entire
 independent lego cad program that lets you do 3d modeling and
  of which there are thousands on youtube and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content just beautiful
 and people recreating all sorts of things  i have to take a moment i love the guy who 's like running away
 with his clasps his hooks okay
  there 's a whole programming language and robotics tool so if you want to teach someone how to program kid adult whatever it is and the guy that made this he made a slot machine out of lego and
  i don 't mean he made lego that looked like a slot machine i mean he made a slot machine out of lego the insides were lego
  fund their entire lego habit by selling the little guy but then you have no guys in your ships and then just some examples this stuff really is sculpture this is amazing what you can 
  do  and don 't kid yourself some architectural details incredible organic shapes and just even nature out of again little blocks this is my house  and
  i was afraid a car was going to come smash it as i was taking a picture for you guys anyway  i 'm out of time but
 just very quickly we 'll just see if i can do this quick  because there aren 't enough ted logos around here
 's see here
