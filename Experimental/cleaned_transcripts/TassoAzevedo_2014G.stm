  the portuguese arrived in latin america about five hundred years ago  they obviously found this amazing tropical forest 
 and among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before they found one species that caught their attention very quickly 
 this species
  you cut the the bark you find a very dark red resin
 that was very good
 to paint and
 dye fabric to make clothes  
 the indigenous people called this species pau brasil  and that 's the reason why this land became land of brasil and
  that 's the only country in the world that has the name
 of a tree  so you can imagine that it 's very cool to be a forester in brazil  among other reasons 
 forest products are all around us  apart from all those products the forest is very important for climate regulation 
 in brazil  almost seventy percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the
  just the amazon pumps to the atmosphere
 twenty billion tons of water every day  this is more than what the amazon river 
 which is the largest river in the world puts in the sea per day  which is seventeen billion tons  if we had to boil water to
  we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world  
 so it 's a hell of a service for all of us  
 we have in the world about four billion hectares of forests 
 this is more or less china u s canada and brazil all together in terms of size to have an idea 
 three quarters of that is in the temperate zone and just one quarter
 is in the tropics  but this one quarter one billion hectares  holds most of the biodiversity  
 and very importantly fifty percent of the living biomass  the carbon  
 now we used to have six billion hectares of forest fifty percent more than what we have two thousand years ago 
 we 've actually lost two billion hectares in the last two thousand years
 but in the last
 one hundred years  we lost half of that 
 that was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests to deforestation of tropical forests  
 so think of this in one hundred years we lost the same amount of forest in the
  in two thousand years in temperate forests that 's the speed of the destruction that we are having now brazil
 is an important piece of this puzzle 
 we have the second largest forest in the world just after russia  it means twelve percent of all the world 's forests are in brazil  
 most of that in the amazon it 's the largest piece of forest we have it 's a very big large area you can see that you could fit many of the european countries there 
 we still have eighty percent
  the forest cover that 's the good news  but we lost fifteen percent in just thirty years  
 so if you go with that speed very soon we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the amazon that regulates our climate 
 deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end
  square kilometers in one year  this is two point seven million hectares it 's almost like half of costa rica
 every year  so at this moment this is two thousand and three two thousand and four i
 i happened to be coming to work in in the government  
 and together with other teammates in the national forest department 
 we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation and make a plan to combat that at a national level involving the local governments  the civil society business 
  that could tackle those causes  so we came up with this
 plan with one hundred and forty four actions in different areas  now i will go through all of them one by one no
 just giving some examples of what
 we had done in in the next few years  so the first thing  we set up a system with the national space agency that
 could actually see where deforestation is happening almost in real time so now in brazil we have this system deter where every month or every two months we 
  get information on where deforestation is happening so we can actually act when it 's happening  
 we saw and sell  and all the revenue becomes a fund that now funds conservation projects of local communities
 as an endowment fund 
 this also allows us to make a big operation to seize corruption and illegal activities that ended up having seven hundred people in prison  including
  a lot of public servants 
 then we made the connection that areas that have been doing illegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance  so we cut this through the bank system
 and then linked this to the end users so supermarkets  the slaughterhouses and so on that buy products from illegal clear cut areas they also can be liable for 
 the deforestation so making all these connections to help to push the problem down 
 land tenure issues it 's very important for conflicts fifty million hectares of protected areas were created which is an area 
  the size of spain and of those eight million were indigenous indigenous lands  now we start to see
 results  so in the last ten years deforestation came down in brazil
 seventy five percent 
 so
 if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade
  we saved eight point seven million hectares  which is the size of austria  
 but more importantly  it avoided
  of three billion tons of co2 in the atmosphere this is
 by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions until today as a positive action 
 one may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease to push down deforestation you will have an economic impact
 because you will not have economic activity or something like that but it 's interesting to know that it 's quite the opposite  in fact in the period
  have the deepest decline of deforestation  the economy grew on average double from the previous decade when deforestation was actually going up  
 so it 's a good lesson for us  maybe this is completely disconnected  as we just learned by having deforestation come down 
 now this is all good news
  quite an achievement and we obviously should be very proud about that
  but it 's not even close to sufficient  
 in fact if you think about the deforestation in the amazon in two thousand and thirteen that was over half a million hectares  
 which means that every minute
 an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the amazon last year  just
  if we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in brazil  we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world it
 's more or less like we are forest heroes  but still deforestation champions  
 so we can 't be satisfied not even close to satisfied so the next step  i think is to fight
  to have zero loss of forest cover in brazil
 and to have that as a goal for two thousand and twenty 
 that 's our next step now i 've always been interested in the relationship between climate change and forests first because
 fifteen percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation  so it 's a big part of the problem  
 but also forests can be a big part of the solution since that 's the best way we know to sink
 carbon now there is another relationship of climate and forests that really stuck me in two thousand and eight and made me change my career from forests to working with climate change  
 i went to visit canada in british columbia  together with
 the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a
  when we were there we we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forests in canada  what we see here those
 brown trees these are really dead trees they are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the
  that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter for many years now they don 't have the sufficient cold weather to actually
 control the population of this beetle and it became a disease that is
 really killing billions of trees  so i came back with this notion that the forest is actually one of the earliest and most
 affected victims of climate change
  so i was thinking if i succeed
 in working with all my colleagues to actually
 help to stop deforestation maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change 
 by floods  heat  fires and so on  so i decided to leave the forest service
  the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward  the goal is very clear we
 want to limit the increase of the average temperature of the planet to two degrees  
 there are several reasons for that i will not get into that now  but in order to get to
  on climate change  defines that we have a budget of emissions of one thousand billion tons of 
 from now until the end of the century  
 so if we divide this by the number of years what we have is an average budget of eleven billion tons of
  now what is one ton of co2 it 's more or less what one small car  running twenty kilometers
 a day  will emit in one year  
 or it 's one flight one way from so paulo to johannesburg or to london one way two ways two tons 
 so eleven billion tons is twice that now
 the emissions today
  are fifty billion tons  and it 's growing it 's growing and maybe it will be 
 by two thousand and twenty  now we need to go down to ten by two thousand and fifty 
 and while this happens the population will grow from seven to nine billion people the economy will grow from sixty trillion dollars in two thousand and ten to two hundred trillion dollars 
 and so what we need to do
 is to
 be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person 
 per year  into something like one 
 you have to choose
 you take the the airplane or you have a car  so the question is can we make it  and
 's the exactly the same question i got when i was
 developing a plan to combat deforestation it 's such a big problem  so complex can we really do it  
 i think so 
 think of this deforestation means sixty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in brazil in the last decade  now it 's a little bit less than thirty percent in the world
 sixty percent is
  so if we can tackle
 directly the energy the same way we could tackle deforestation maybe we can have a chance  
 so there are five things that i think we should we should do first we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions we don 't need to 
  all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy that 's what we proved when we decreased deforestation and the economy continued to grow same thing
  could happen in the in the energy sector  
 second we have to move the incentives to the right place today five hundred billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels 
 why don 't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy  
 third  we need to measure and make it transparent where when and who is emitting greenhouse gases so
 have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities  fourth  we need to leapfrog the routes of development  
 which means you don 't need to go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones same way we don 't need to go to fossil fuels to the one billion people who don 't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy
  and fifth and last we need to share responsibility between governments  business and civil society 
 there is work to do for everybody and we need to have everybody on board  
 so to finalize i think
 the future is not like a fate
 that you have to just go as business as usual goes  
 we need to have the courage to actually change the route invest in something new think that we can actually change the route i think we are
  doing this with deforestation in brazil and i hope we can do it also with climate change in the world
