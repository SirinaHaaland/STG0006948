  good evening my journey to this stage began when i came to america at the age of seventeen 
 you see i 'm one of the eighty four million americans who are immigrants or children of immigrants  each of us has a dream
 when we come here a dream that usually has to be rewritten
 and always has to be repurposed 
 i was one of the lucky ones my revised dream led me to the work i do today  training immigrants to run for public office
 and leading a movement for inclusive democracy
  but i don 't want you to think it was a cakewalk that america opened its arms wide and welcomed me it 's still not doing that 
 and i 've learned a few lessons along the way that i wanted to share with you because i think that together we can make american democracy better and stronger  
 i was born in india  the world 's largest democracy
  and when i was four my family moved to belize  the world 's smallest democracy perhaps  
 and at the age of seventeen  i moved to the united states  the world 's greatest democracy 
 i came because i wanted to study english literature 
 you see as a child  i buried my nose in books  and i thought why not make a living doing that as an adult 
 but after i graduated from college and got a graduate degree
 i found myself moving from one less ideal job to another  
 maybe it was the optimism that i had about america that made me take a while to understand
 that things were not going to change the door that i thought was open
 was actually just slightly ajar this door of america that would open wide if you had the right
  name the right skin color  the right networks  but could just slam in your face
 if you had the wrong religion the wrong immigration status  the wrong skin color  
 and i just couldn 't accept that so i started a career as a
  starting an organization for young people like myself i was young at the time that i started it
 who traced their heritage to the indian subcontinent 
 in that work i became and advocate for south asians and other immigrants  i lobbied members of congress on policy issues 
 i volunteered on election day to do exit polling  
 but i couldn 't vote  and i couldn 't run for office
 so in two thousand when it was announced
 that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from ninety five dollars to two hundred and twenty five dollars i decided it was time to apply
 before i could no longer afford it i filled out a long application answering questions about my current
 and my past affiliations  and once the application
  was submitted  there were fingerprints to be taken a test to study for endless hours of waiting in line 
 you might call it extreme vetting 
 and then in december of two thousand i joined hundreds of other immigrants
 in a hall in brooklyn where we pledged our loyalty to a country that we had long
  long considered home my journey from international student to american citizen took sixteen years a short timeline
 when you compare it to other immigrant stories  and soon after i had taken that formal step
 to becoming an american the attacks of september eleven two thousand and one changed the immigration landscape
 for decades to come
 my city new york city was reeling and healing and in the midst of it we were in an election cycle 
 two things happened as we coped with loss and recovery in new york city 
 voters elected michael bloomberg mayor of new york city  
 we also
 adopted by ballot referendum
  office of immigrant affairs for the city of new york five months after that election  the newly elected mayor
 appointed me the first commissioner of immigrant affairs for this newly established office  
 i want you to come back to that time i was a young immigrant woman from belize i had basically floundered in various jobs
  in america before i started a community based organization
 in a church basement in queens  
 the attacks of september eleven sent shock waves through my community 
 people who were members of my family 
 young people i had worked with were experiencing harassment at schools at workplaces and in airports  
  i was going to represent their concerns
 in government 
 no job felt more perfect for me and here are two things i learned when i became commissioner 
 first
 new yorkers who were in city government holding government positions had no idea how scared immigrants were of
  law enforcement most of us don 't really know the difference do we between a sheriff and local police and the fbi  
 and most of us when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods
 feel curiosity if not concern  
 so if you 're an undocumented parent every day when you say goodbye to your child  send them off to school and go to work
 you don 't know what the chances are that you 're going to see them at the end of the day because a raid at your workplace 
 a chance encounter with local police could change the course of your life forever  
 the second thing i learned is that when people like me who understood that fear
  who had learned a new language who had navigated new systems when people like us were sitting at the table  
 we advocated for our communities ' needs in a way that no one else could
 or would  i understood
 what that feeling of fear was like 
 people in my family were experiencing it young people i had worked with were being harassed not just by classmates  but also by their teachers 
 my husband then boyfriend thought twice
  before he put a backpack on or grew a beard because he traveled so much 
 what i learned in two thousand and one was that my vote mattered but that my voice and vantage point also mattered  
 and it 's these three things immigrants ' votes  voices and vantage points that i think can help make our democracy stronger
 we actually have the power
 to change the outcome of elections to introduce new issues into the policy debate and to change the face
 of the pale  male stale leadership that we have in our country today  so how do we do that
  let 's talk first about votes it will come as no surprise to you that the majority of voters in america are white  
 but it might surprise you to know that one in three voters
 are black latino or asian but here 's the thing it doesn 't just matter who can vote it matters who does vote 
 so in two thousand and twelve half of the latino and asian american
  and these votes matter not just in presidential elections  they matter in local and state elections in
 two thousand and fifteen lan diep  the eldest son of political refugees from vietnam  
 ran for a seat in the san jose city council 
 he lost that election by thirteen votes
  he dusted off those campaign shoes and went back
 to run for that seat and this time he won by twelve votes
  every one of our votes matters  
 and when people like lan are sitting at the policy table  they can make a difference we need those voices
 we need those voices in part because
 american leadership does not
  look like america 's residents  there are over five hundred thousand local and state offices in america 
 fewer than two percent of those offices are held by asian americans or latinos the two largest immigrant groups in our country 
 in the city of yakima washington
  of the population is latino there has never been a latino on the city council
 until this year  three newly elected latinas
 joined the yakima city council in two thousand and sixteen one of them is carmen  mndez 
 she is a first generation college student she grew up partly in colima mexico 
 and partly in yakima washington she 's a single mother a community advocate 
 her voice on the yakima city
  council
 is advocating on behalf of the latino community and of all yakima residents  and she 's a role model for her daughter and other latinas  
 but the third most untapped resource in american democracy
 is the vantage point that immigrants bring we have fought to be here  we have come for economic and educational opportunity
  we have come for political and religious freedom  we have come in the pursuit of love 
 that dedication that commitment to america
 we also bring to public service people like athena salman who just last week won
 the primary for a seat in the arizona state house
 athena 's father grew up in the west bank and moved to chicago  where he met her mother 
 her mother is part italian part mexican and part german together they moved to arizona and built a life  
 athena when she gets to the statehouse is going to fight for things like education funding that will help give families like hers a leg up
 so they can achieve the financial stability that we all
  looking for 
 immigrants ' votes voices and vantage points
 are what we all need to work to include in american democracy it 's not just my work it 's also yours  
 and it 's not going to be easy  we never know
 what putting a new factor into an equation will
  and it 's a little scary you
 're scared that i 'm going to take away your place at the table  and i 'm scared that i 'm never going to get a place at the table 
 and we 're all scared that we 're going to lose this country that we know and love  
 i 'm scared you 're going to take it away from me and you 're scared
 i 'm going to take it away from you 
 look it 's been a rough election year
  reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader  but i have fought
 to be in this country and i continue to do so every day 
 so my optimism never wavers 
 because i know that there are millions of immigrants just like me in front of me  behind me and all around me 
 it 's our country
