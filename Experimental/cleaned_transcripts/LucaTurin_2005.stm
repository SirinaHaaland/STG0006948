  the fragrance that you will smell you will never be able to smell this way again its a fragrance called beyond paradise which you can find in any store in the nation except here its been split up in parts
 by este lauder
 and by the perfumer who did it  calice becker  and i 'm most grateful to them for this
  and its been split up in successive bits and a chord so what youre smelling now
 is the top note  and then will come what they call the heart  the lush heart note i will show it to you 
 the eden top note is named after the eden project in the   u k 
 the lush heart note  melaleuca bark note which does not contain any melaleuca bark because its totally
 forbidden and
  that the complete fragrance now what you are smelling is a combination of
 i asked how many
 molecules there were in there and nobody would tell me so i put it through a  g c a gas chromatograph that i have in my in my office  and its about four hundred 
 so what youre smelling is several hundred molecules
 floating through the air hitting your nose and do not
  get the impression that this is very subjective you are all smelling pretty much the same thing ok smell has this reputation of being
 somewhat
 different for each person its not really true and perfumery shows you that cant be true  because if it were like that it wouldnt be an art  ok  now
  while the smell wafts
  let me tell you the history of an idea everything that youre smelling in here
 is made up of atoms that come from what i call the upper east side of the periodic table a nice safe neighborhood 
 you really dont want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the
 bad parts and it didnt really work these are the five atoms from which just about everything that youre going to smell in real life from coffee to
  fragrance are made of the top note that you smelled at the very beginning the cut grass green what we call in perfumery theyre weird terms
 and this would be called a green note because it smells of something green like cut grass this is
 and i had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years a very expensive high school chemistry education
  this has six carbon atoms so
 hexa hexene 1 ol it has one double bond it has an alcohol on the end so its ol and thats why they call it cis 3 hexene 1 ol once you figure this out you can really impress people at parties this smells of cut grass  
 now this is the skeleton of the molecule
 if you dress it up
 with atoms hydrogen atoms thats what it looks like when you have it on your computer but actually its sort of more like this in the sense that the atoms have a certain
 sphere that you cannot penetrate they repel  ok  now  why does this thing smell
 of cut grass  ok  why doesnt it smell of
 potatoes or
 violets well there are really two theories but the first theory is it must be the shape 
 and thats a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology
  works by shape  enzymes that chew things up
 antibodies its all you know the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing in this case a smell
  and i will try and explain to you whats wrong with this notion and the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations  now this is a totally insane idea and when i first came
  across it in the early ' 90s i thought my predecessor malcolm dyson and bob wright had really taken leave of their senses and ill explain to you why this was the case  
 however i came to realize gradually that they may be right
 and i have to convince all my colleagues that this is so but im working on it  heres how shape works
 in in normal receptors 
 you have a molecule coming in it gets into the protein which is schematic here and it causes this thing to switch to turn to
  move in some way by binding
 in certain parts  and the attraction the forces between the molecule and the protein cause the motion this is a shape based idea  
 now  whats wrong with shape is summarized in this slide the way
 i expect everybody to memorize these compounds
  one page of work from a chemists workbook ok  working for a fragrance company 
 hes making forty five molecules and hes looking for a sandalwood something that smells of sandalwood because theres a lot of money in sandalwoods and
 of these forty five molecules only four thousand six hundred and twenty nine actually smells of sandalwood and he puts an exclamation mark ok  this is an awful lot of work this actually
 two hundred thousand dollars roughly if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits  so this is a profoundly inefficient process and my definition of a theory is its not just something that you teach people its labor saving a theory
 is something that enables you to do less work i love the idea of doing less work  so
 let me explain to you why a very simple fact that tells you
  and this smells of rotten eggs  ok  now  you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs
 if it does you put the glass down you go to a different bar  this is
  at no concentration even pure you know  if you smelt pure ethanol it doesnt smell of rotten eggs  conversely there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound
 will smell like vodka 
 its very hard to explain this by molecular recognition now i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology and he says thats easy the things are a different color
  color 
 we have to go a little beyond that now
 let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it
  these molecules as you saw in the beginning the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other in fact molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them so this is the sound
 of the o h stretch translated into the audible range 
 s h quite a different frequency now this is kind of interesting because
 it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact which is this  nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except
  that frequency
 except s h if you look on this 
 imagine a piano keyboard the s h stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been so to speak damaged  and there are no neighboring notes nothing is close to it you have a unique smell a unique vibration  
 so
 i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story i went searching for a type of molecule
 any molecule that would have that vibration
 and that the
 obvious prediction
 was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur if it didnt the whole idea was toast  and i might as well move on to other things  
 now  after
 searching high and low for several months  i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane
 which has exactly the same vibration
  now the good news is boranes you can get hold of the bad news is theyre rocket fuels
 most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air  and when you call up the companies they only give you minimum ten tons  ok 
 so
 this was not what they call a laboratory scale experiment  and they wouldnt have liked it at my
  and it really does have the same if you calculate if you measure the vibrational frequencies they are the same as as  s h now does it smell of sulfur 
 well  if you go back in the literature theres a man who knew more about boranes than anyone alive then or since alfred stock he synthesized all of them 
 and in an enormous
 paper in german
 he says 
 at one point my wife is german and she translated it for me and at one point he says ganz widerlich geruch an absolutely repulsive smell which is good
  reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide so this fact that boranes smell of sulfur had been known since
  fly in the ointment is this that if we smell molecular vibrations  we must have a spectroscope in our nose  
 now this is a spectroscope  ok  
 on my laboratory bench  and its fair to say that if you look up somebodys nose youre unlikely to see anything resembling this and this is the main objection to the theory ok great we smell vibrations how
 when people ask this kind of question they neglect something which is that physicists are really clever  unlike biologists 
 this is a joke im a biologist ok so its a joke against myself bob jacklovich and john lamb at ford motor company in the days when ford motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research discovered
 a a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically
  nano scale in other words no mirrors no lasers no prisms no nonsense just a tiny device and he built this device  and this device uses electron tunneling  
 now  i could do the the dance of electron tunneling but ive done a video instead which
 is much more interesting heres how it works electrons are fuzzy creatures  and they can jump across
  but only at equal energy if the energy differs they cant jump  unlike us they wont fall off the cliff
  ok  
 now  
 if something absorbs the energy the electron can travel so here you have a system you have something and theres plenty of that stuff in biology some substance giving an electron 
 and the electron tries to jump and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration
 does the reaction happen ok
  is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built and every single part of this mechanism is actually
 plausible in biology 
 in other words ive taken off the shelf components and ive made a spectroscope whats nice about this idea   if you have a philosophical bent of mind is that then it tells you that the nose
  and then a magnificent thing happened i left academia and joined the real world
 of business and a company was created around my ideas
 to make new molecules
  using my method along the lines of lets put someone elses money where your mouth is and one of the first things that happened was
 we started going around to fragrance companies asking
 for what they needed because of course  if you could calculate smell you dont need chemists you need a computer a mac will do it if you know how to
  you can try a thousand molecules you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend  and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one  and so thats a direct path
 to making new odorants and one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in france and heres where i do my charles fleischer impression and one of them says 
 you cannot make a coumarin he says to me i bet you cannot make a coumarin now coumarin is a very common thing
  material in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from south america  and it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical  
 ok  its the molecule that has made mens fragrances smell the way they do since one thousand eight hundred and eighty one to be exact  
 and the problem is its a carcinogen so nobody likes particularly
  there are some reckless people but its not worth it  ok  so they asked us to make a new coumarin  
 and so we started doing calculations and the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin and you smooth it out so that you have a nice
 picture of what the sort of chord so to speak of coumarin is  and then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules
  unrelated that have the same vibrations  and we actually in this case im
 sorry to say it happened it was serendipitous  because
 i got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said look 
 ive just found this such a beautiful reaction that even if this compound doesnt smell of coumarin i want to do it its just such a nifty
  one step i mean chemists have weird weird minds one step ninety percent yield you know  and you get this lovely crystalline compound let us try it and i said first of all let me do the calculation
 on that compound  bottom right which is related to coumarin but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule 
 calculate the vibrations  the purple spectrum is that new fellow  the white
 one is the old one and the prediction is it should smell of coumarin  they made it  and
 it smelled exactly like coumarin  and this is our new
 baby called tonkene  you see when youre a scientist youre always selling ideas  and people are very resistant to ideas and rightly so why should new ideas be
  when you put a little 
  vial on the table in front of perfumers
 and it smells like coumarin and it isnt coumarin  and youve found it in three weeks this focuses everybodys mind wonderfully 
 and people often ask me is your theory accepted and i said well
 by whom i mean
 most you know theres three attitudes  youre right and i dont know why which is the most rational one at this point 
 youre right and i dont care
 how you do it in a sense you bring me the molecules you know and youre completely wrong and im sure youre completely wrong  ok  now  were dealing with people who only want results
 and this is the commercial world and they tell us that even if we do it by astrology theyre happy
  were not actually doing it by astrology  but for the last three years ive had what i consider to be the best job in the entire universe which is to put my
 hobby which is you know 
 fragrance and all the magnificent things plus a little bit of biophysics a small amount of  self taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works
