  was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at yale university in the department of medicine
  and my job was to write many of the algorithms and code for nasa to do virtual surgery in preparation for the astronauts going into 
  deep space flight so they could be kept in robotic pods  one of the fascinating things about what we were working on is that we were seeing 
 using new scanning technologies things that had never been seen before not only in disease management but also things that allowed us to see things about the body
 that just made you marvel i remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen
  your entire body everything your hair skin bone nails everything is made of collagen and it 's a kind of rope like structure that
 twirls and swirls like this and the only place that collagen changes its its structure is in the cornea of your eye in your eye  it
 becomes a grid formation  and therefore it becomes transparent as opposed to opaque  so perfectly organized a structure
 it was hard not to attribute divinity to it because we kept on seeing this 
 in different parts of the body  one of the opportunities i had was
 one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the nih and what we were going to do was scan
 a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these new technologies  so i wrote the
  and code and he built the hardware paul lauterbur
 then went onto win the nobel prize for inventing the mri  i got the data  and i 'm going to show you a sample of the piece from conception to birth
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
  but as you can see when you actually start working on this data  it 's pretty spectacular  and as we kept on scanning more and more 
 working on this project looking at these two simple cells that have this unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you 
  and as we kept on working on this data  looking at small clusters of the body these little
 pieces of tissue that were the trophoblasts coming off of the blastocyst all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus saying 
 i 'm here to stay having conversation and communications with the estrogens the progesterones saying i 'm here to stay  plant me building this incredible trilinear fetus
  something that you can recognize and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being the marvel of this information how do we actually have this biological mechanism 
 inside our body to actually see this information  i 'm going to show you something pretty unique 
  itself within five weeks you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles 
 six weeks these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down
 each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart
 and then basically the development of the entire human body the magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure saying exactly where that nerve cell should go
  complexity of these the mathematical models of how these things are indeed done
 are beyond human comprehension even though i am a mathematician i look at this with marvel of how do these instruction sets
 not make these mistakes as they build what is us  it 's a mystery it 's magic it 's divinity  then you start to take a look at adult life 
 take a look at this little tuft of capillaries it 's just a tiny
 sub substructure microscopic but basically by the time you 're nine
 nine months and you 're given birth  you have almost sixty thousand miles of vessels inside your body
 and only one mile is visible fifty nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away the complexity of building that within a single system is again beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today
  then instructions set from the brain to every other part of the body look at the complexity of the folding where does this intelligence of knowing that a fold can actually hold more information  so 
  as you actually watch the baby 's brain grow and this is one of the things we 're doing we 're launching two new studies of scanning babies ' brains from the moment they 're born every
 six months until they 're six years old we 're going to be doing about two hundred and fifty children 
 watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us  and it 's not just
  our own existence but how does the woman 's body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological cardiovascular
 treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond again our comprehension the magic that is existence that is us  thank you
