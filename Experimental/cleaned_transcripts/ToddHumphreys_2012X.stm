  something happened in the early morning hours of may 2nd two thousand 
 that had a profound effect on the way our society operates  
 ironically hardly anyone noticed at the time the change was silent  imperceptible unless you knew exactly what to look
  for on that morning u s president bill clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the global positioning system 
 instantaneously  every civilian gps receiver around the globe
 went from errors the size of a football field
 to errors the size of a small
  it 's hard to overstate
 the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us 
 before this switch was thrown  we didn 't have in car navigation systems giving turn by turn directions because back then gps couldn 't tell you what block you were on let alone what street 
 for geolocation accuracy matters  
 and things have only improved over the last ten years  with more base stations more ground stations
  receivers and better algorithms gps can now not only tell you what street you are on but what part of the street 
 this level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation 
 in fact  many of you navigated here today with the help of your tomtom or your
  paper maps are becoming
 obsolete  but we now stand on the verge of another revolution
 in geolocation accuracy what if i told you that the two meter positioning that our current cell phones and our our tomtoms give us
 is pathetic compared to what we could be getting 
 for some time now it 's been known that if you pay attention to the carrier phase of the gps signal  and if you have an internet connection then you can go from meter level
 to centimeter level even millimeter level positioning  
 so why don 't we have this capability on our on our phones only i believe for a lack
 of imagination manufacturers haven 't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap gps chips
 because they 're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your
  hand  
 but you and i and other innovators we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy 
 imagine for example an augmented reality app
 that overlays a virtual world to millimeter level precision on top of the physical world 
 i could build for you a structure up here in 3d millimeter accurate that only you could see or my friends at home
  so this level of positioning this is what we 're looking for and i believe that within the next few years i predict that this kind of
  carrier phase based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous and the consequences will be fantastic  the holy
  of course is the gps dot do you remember the movie the da vinci code 
 here 's professor langdon examining a gps dot which his accomplice tells him
 is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe  but we know that in the world of nonfiction 
 the gps dot is impossible right  
 for one thing gps doesn 't work indoors and for
  they don 't make devices quite this small especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network 
 well  these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago  but things have changed  
 there 's been a strong trend toward miniaturization better sensitivity  
 so much so that a few years ago a gps tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys  
 compare that with the device released just months ago
 that 's now packaged into something the size of a key
  fob  
 and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete gps receiver which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever you realize that the gps dot
  will soon move from fiction to nonfiction  
 imagine what we could do with a world full of gps
  it 's not just that you 'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore or your child when you 're at disneyland 
 you 'll buy gps dots in bulk and you 'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars 
 i couldn 't find my shoes one recent morning and as usual had to ask my wife if she had seen them  
 but i shouldn 't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality  
 i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are
  those of you who have made the switch to gmail remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email
 to simply searching it the gps dot will do the same for our possessions now of course there is
 a flip side to the gps dot i was in my office some months back and got a telephone call the
  woman on the other end of the line we 'll call her carol was panicked 
 apparently   an ex boyfriend of carol 's from california had found her in texas and was following her around  
 so you might ask at this point why she 's calling you well so did i but it turned out there was a technical twist to carol 's case
  would show up at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations he was carrying an open laptop  
 and over time carol realized that he had planted a gps tracking device on her car  so she was calling me for help to disable it 
 well you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car i said i already
  he didn 't see anything obvious  and he said he 'd have to take the car apart piece by piece 
 well then you 'd better go to the the police i said i already have she replied 
 they 're not sure this rises to the level of harassment  and they 're not set up technically to find the device 
 okay what about the fbi i 've talked to them too 
 and same story we then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car
 but i wasn 't even sure that would work  
 given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they 're inside safe zones or when the car is moving 
 so there we were carol isn 't the first and certainly won 't be the last to find herself in this kind of
 fearsome environment  worrisome situation caused by gps tracking
 in fact  as i looked into her case i discovered to my surprise that it 's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else 's car  
 the supreme court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking  
 but the law isn 't clear about civilians doing this to one another so it 's not just
 big brother we have to worry about
  but big neighbor there is
 one alternative that carol could have taken very effective  it 's called the wave bubble  
 it 's an open source gps jammer  developed by limor fried a graduate student at
  and limor calls it a tool for reclaiming our personal space 
 with a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which gps signals can 't reside they get drowned out by the bubble  
 and limor designed this in part because like carol she felt threatened by gps tracking then she posted her design to the web  
 and if you don 't have time to build your own  you can buy one chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical
  devices
 on the internet 
 so you might be thinking the wave bubble sounds great  i should have one might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car  
 but you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the united states  and why is that well because
 it 's not a bubble at all its jamming signals don 't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car
  they go on to jam innocent gps receivers for miles around you laughter
 now if you 're carol or limor or someone who feels threatened by gps tracking  
 it might not feel wrong to turn on a wave bubble  
 but in fact  the results can be disastrous  imagine for example
  the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog
 and some passenger in the back turns on a wave bubble all of a sudden your gps readout goes blank 
 and now it 's just you and the fog
 and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it 
 they in fact  they don 't update or upkeep
  the only backup to gps was discontinued last year 
 our modern society has a special relationship with gps we
 're almost blindly reliant on it it 's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure some call it the invisible utility 
 so turning on a wave bubble might not just cause inconvenience  it might be
 deadly
  but as it turns out for purposes of protecting your privacy
 at the expense of general gps reliability  there 's something even more potent
 and more subversive than a wave bubble  and that is a gps spoofer  
 the idea behind the gps spoofer is simple  instead of jamming the gps signals you fake them  you imitate them
 and if you do it right the device you 're attacking doesn 't even know it 's being spoofed 
 so let me show you how this works 
 in any gps receiver there 's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals these three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak 
 but if you send in a fake
  peak pops up  and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned 
 the tracking points can 't tell the difference  and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal  with the authentic peak getting forced off 
 at this point the game is over the fake signals now completely control this gps receiver  
 so is this really possible can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a gps receiver just like that with
  spoofer well
 the short answer is yes  
 the key is that civil gps signals are completely open  they have no encryption  they have no authentication they 're wide open vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack 
 even so up until very recently  nobody worried about gps spoofers  people figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one
  but i and a friend of mine from graduate school we didn 't see it that way 
 we knew it wasn 't going to be so hard 
 and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against gps spoofing 
 i remember vividly the week it all came together  we built it at my home  which means that
 i got a little extra help from my
 three year old son ramon  here 's ramon looking for a little attention from dad that week 
 at first the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers  though we eventually got it packaged into a small box now 
 the dr frankenstein moment 
 when the spoofer finally came alive and i glimpsed its awful potential came late one
  night when i tested the spoofer against my iphone  let me show you some actual footage from that very first experiment 
 i had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo they seemed to speak to me they 'd say here you are 
 here you are 
 and you can trust us
  something felt very wrong about the world it was a sense almost of betrayal when this little blue dot started at my house 
 and went running off toward the north leaving me behind i wasn 't moving 
 what i then saw in this little moving blue dot
 was the potential for chaos 
  i saw airplanes and ships veering off course with the captain learning only too late
 that something was wrong 
 i saw the  gps derived timing of the new york stock exchange being manipulated by hackers  you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause
 if you knew what you were doing with a gps spoofer
  spoofer  it 's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of gps dots 
 imagine for example you 're being tracked well you can play the tracker
 for a fool pretending to be at work when you 're really on vacation 
 or if you 're carol you could lure your ex boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him 
 so i 'm fascinated by this
 conflict
  looming conflict between privacy on the one hand
 and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other we simply cannot tolerate gps jammers and spoofers  and yet  
 given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the gps dot can you really blame people for wanting
  to turn them on for wanting to use them  i hold out hope that we 'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of 
 some yet
 uninvented technology  
 but meanwhile  grab some popcorn  because things are going to get interesting  
 within the next few years  many of you will be the proud owner of a gps dot  maybe you 'll have a whole bag full of them  
 you 'll never lose track of your things
  again the gps dot will fundamentally reorder your life  
 but will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man 
 or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a gps spoofer or a wave bubble to protect your own privacy 
 so as usual what we see just beyond the horizon
 is full of promise and peril it 'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out
