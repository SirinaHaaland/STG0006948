  so a few years ago  i did something really brave
 or some would say really stupid i ran for congress 
 for years i had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser as an organizer
 in my heart  i always wanted to run 
 the sitting congresswoman had been in my district since one thousand nine hundred and ninety two she had never lost a race  
 and no one had really even run against her in a democratic primary  
 but in my mind  this was my way to make a difference to disrupt the
  a very different story  my pollsters told me that i was crazy to run that there was no way that i could win  
 but i ran anyway  and in two thousand and twelve i became an upstart in a new york city congressional race  i swore
 i was going to win  i had the endorsement from the new york daily
  the wall street journal snapped pictures of me on election day  and cnbc called it one of the hottest races in the country  
 i raised money from everyone i knew  including indian aunties that were just so happy an indian girl was running  
 but on election day  the polls were right  and i only got nineteen percent of the vote 
 and the same papers that said i was a rising political star now said i wasted one point three million
  dollars on six thousand three hundred and twenty one votes don 't do the math 
 it was humiliating 
 now  before you get the wrong idea  this is not a talk about the importance of failure  nor is it about leaning in  
 i tell you the story of how i ran for congress because i was thirty three years old
  and it was the first time in my entire life
 that i had done something that was truly brave  where i didn 't worry about being perfect and
 i 'm not alone  so many women i talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they 're going to be great in 
 that they know they 're going to be perfect in 
 and it 's no wonder why most girls
  are taught to avoid risk and failure  we 're taught to smile pretty play it safe get all a 's 
 boys on the other hand are taught to play rough  swing high  crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off
 headfirst  and by the time they 're adults  whether they 're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on
  take risk after risk they 're rewarded for it it
 's often said in silicon valley no one even takes you seriously unless you 've had two failed start ups 
 in other words we 're raising our girls to be perfect  and we 're raising our boys to be brave 
 some people worry about our federal deficit
 but i i worry about our bravery deficit our economy our society we 're just losing out
 because we 're not raising our girls to be brave  
 the bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in stem in c suites in boardrooms in congress and pretty much
 everywhere you look
  psychologist carol dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them 
 she found that bright girls were quick to give up  the higher the iq the more likely they were to give up  
 bright boys on the other hand found the difficult material to be a challenge  they found it energizing 
 they were more likely to redouble their efforts 
 what 's going on
  fifth grade level girls routinely outperform boys in every subject  including math and science 
 so it 's not a question of ability 
 the difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge  and it doesn 't just end in fifth grade 
 an hp report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only sixty percent of the qualifications
  but women women will apply only if they meet one hundred percent
 of the qualifications one hundred percent 
 this study is usually invoked as evidence that well 
 women need a little more confidence  but i think it 's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection and they 're overly cautious
  when we 're ambitious even when we 're leaning in that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers 
 and so those six hundred thousand jobs that are open right now
 in computing and tech 
 women are being left behind and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve
  solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect 
 so in two thousand and twelve i started a company to teach girls to code 
 and what i found is that by teaching them to code i had socialized them to be
  it 's an endless process of trial and error of trying to get the right command in the right place with sometimes just a semicolon
 making the difference between success and failure code breaks and then it falls apart  
 and it often takes many many tries until that magical moment
 when what you 're trying to build comes to life
  we immediately see in our program our girls ' fear of not getting it right of not being perfect  
 every girls who code teacher tells me the same story  during the first week when the girls are learning how to code a student will call her over and she 'll say 
 i don 't know what code to write 
 the teacher will look at her screen  and she 'll see a blank text editor
  't know any better she 'd think that her student spent the past twenty minutes just staring at the screen  
 but if she presses undo a few times she 'll see that her student wrote code
 and then deleted it she tried  she came close  but she didn 't get it exactly right 
 instead of showing the progress that she made she 'd rather show nothing at all
  perfection
 or bust it turns out that our girls are really good
 at coding  but it 's not enough just to teach them to code my friend lev brie who is a professor at the university of columbia and teaches intro to java
 tells me about his office hours with computer science students when the guys are struggling with an assignment they 'll come in and
  professor there 's something wrong with my code 
 the girls will come in and say professor there 's something wrong with me 
 we have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection  but we 've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone  
 because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system 
  't tell you how many women tell me i 'm afraid to raise my hand  i 'm afraid to ask a question because i don 't want to be the only one who doesn 't understand 
 the only one
 who is struggling when we teach girls to be brave
 and we have a supportive network cheering them on 
  they will build incredible things  and i see this
 every day  take for instance two of our high school students who built a game called tampon run yes tampon run
 to fight against the menstruation taboo
 and sexism in gaming or the syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country
 by building an app to help americans get to the polls
 or 
 girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant
 in the off chance that she can save her daddy 's life
 because he has cancer these are just three examples of
  thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect who have learned to keep trying who have learned perseverance  and whether they become coders
 or the next hillary clinton or beyonc they will not
 defer their dreams and those dreams have never been more important
 for our country  for the american economy for any economy to grow to truly innovate  we cannot leave behind
 half our population  we have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection  and we 've got to do it
 now  
 we cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like i did when i was thirty three years old  
 we have to teach them to be brave in schools and early
  in their careers when it has the most potential to impact their lives
 and the lives of others  and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted
 not for being perfect
 but for being courageous  and so i need each of you to tell every young woman you know
 your sister your niece your employee your colleague
 to be comfortable with imperfection  because when we teach girls to be
  imperfect  and we help them leverage it we will build a movement of young women who are brave
 and who will build a better world for themselves
 and for each and every one of us thank you
  it 's such a powerful vision you have you have a vision 
 tell me how it 's going how many girls are involved now in your program reshma saujani yeah so in two thousand and twelve  we taught twenty girls 
 this year we 'll teach forty thousand in all fifty states and
 that number is really powerful because last
  year we we only graduated seven thousand five hundred women in computer science like the problem is so bad
 that we can make that type of change quickly ca 
 and you 're working with some of the companies in this room even who are welcoming graduates from your program rs yeah we have about eighty partners from twitter to facebook
  to microsoft to pixar to disney i mean every single company out there and if you 're not signed up i 'm going to find you 
 because we need every single tech company to embed a girls who code classroom in their office ca and you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in
 more gender balance in
 the engineering teams good things happen rs great things happen  i mean i think that it 's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now eighty five percent of all consumer purchases are made by
  women women use social media at a rate of six hundred percent more than men we own the internet  
 and we should be building the companies of tomorrow  and i think when companies have diverse teams  and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams  they build awesome things and we see it every day ca reshma
 you saw the reaction there you 're doing incredibly important work  this whole community is cheering you on more power to
