  we all need a reason to wake up 
 for me it just took eleven thousand volts  
 i know you 're too polite to ask so i will tell you one night  sophomore year of college just
  back from thanksgiving holiday a few of my friends and i were
 horsing around and we decided to climb atop a parked
 commuter train it was just sitting there with the wires that run overhead  somehow that seemed like a
 great idea at the time we 'd certainly done stupider things  i scurried up the ladder on the back and when i stood up
  electrical current entered my arm  blew down and out my feet and that was that 
 would you believe that watch still works  takes a licking my
 father wears it now in solidarity
  that night began my formal relationship with death
 my death
 and it also began my long run as a patient it 's a good word it means one who suffers so
 i guess we 're all patients  
 now  the american health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction
 to match its brilliance to be sure
  i 'm a physician now a hospice and palliative medicine doc so i 've seen care from both sides
 and believe me almost everyone who goes into healthcare
 really means well i mean truly  but we who work in it
 are also unwitting agents for a system that too often
 does not serve  why well there 's actually a pretty easy answer to that question and it explains a lot
  lot because healthcare was designed with diseases not people at its center  
 which is to say of course it was badly designed 
 and nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life 
 where things are so
  distilled and concentrated
 my purpose today is to reach out
 across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation that is 
 to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying
 we have a monumental opportunity in front of us
  one of the few universal issues
 as individuals as well as a civil society to rethink and redesign how it is we die  
 so let 's begin at the end for most people the scariest thing
  about death isn 't being dead it 's dying suffering it 's a key distinction
 to get underneath this it can be very helpful to tease out suffering
 which is necessary as it is from
 suffering we can change  the former is a natural  essential part of life part of the deal and to this we are called to make space
 adjust  grow  
 it can be really good
 to realize forces larger than ourselves they bring
 proportionality like a cosmic right sizing 
 after my limbs were gone that loss for example became fact
  fixed necessarily part of my life and i learned that i could no more reject
 this fact than reject myself it
 took me a while but i learned it eventually  
 now another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that
 unites caregiver and
  care receiver human beings 
 this we are finally realizing is where healing happens  yes compassion
 literally as we learned yesterday suffering together  
 now on the systems side on the other hand so much of the suffering is unnecessary invented it serves no
 good purpose  but the good news is since this brand of suffering is made up well we can change it 
 how we die is indeed something we can affect
  making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering
 gives us our first of three design cues for the day
 after all our role as caregivers as people who care is to relieve suffering
 not add to the pile  
 true to the tenets of palliative care i function as something of a reflective advocate as much as prescribing physician
  quick aside palliative care a very important field but poorly understood
 while it includes it is not limited to  end of life care it is not limited to hospice it
 's simply about comfort and living well at any stage so please know that you don 't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care  
 now let me introduce you
  sort of makes this point i 've been seeing frank now for years he 's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long standing hiv
  we work on his bone pain and his fatigue but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life
 really about our lives 
 in this way frank grieves in this way he keeps up with his losses as they roll in so that he 's ready to take in the next moment
  loss is one thing but regret quite another
  frank has always been an adventurer he looks like something out of a norman rockwell painting and no fan of regret  
 so it wasn 't surprising when he came into clinic one day saying he wanted to raft down the colorado river 
 was this a good idea with all the risks to his safety and his health
 some would say no many did but he went for it while he still could
 it was a glorious marvelous trip  
 freezing water  
 blistering dry heat  scorpions snakes  wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the grand canyon
 all the glorious side of the world beyond our control
 frank 's decision while maybe dramatic is exactly the kind so many of us would make if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves
 over time 
 so much of what we 're talking about today is a shift in perspective  
 after my accident when i went back to college i changed my major to art history
  studying visual art i figured i 'd learn something about how to see
 a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn 't change so much of what he was seeing 
 perspective that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with turning anguish into a flower
  now i work at
 an amazing place in san francisco called the zen hospice project where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective  
 when one of our residents dies  
 the mortuary men come  and as we 're wheeling the body out through the garden heading for the gate we pause  
 anyone who wants
 fellow residents
  the hearse drivers too now
 shares a story or a song or silence as we sprinkle the body with flower petals it
 takes a few minutes it 's a
 sweet simple parting image
 to usher in grief with warmth  rather than repugnance  
 contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting 
 much like this floodlit room
 lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don 't stop even when the patient 's life has 
 cleaning crew swoops in the body 's whisked away and it all
 feels as though that person had never really existed well intended of course in the name
  of sterility but hospitals tend to assault our senses  and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness
 anesthetic literally the opposite of aesthetic 
 i revere hospitals for what they can do i am alive because of them  
 but we ask too much of our hospitals they are places for acute trauma and treatable illness  they are no place to live and die
  that 's not what they were designed for 
 now mind you i am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become
 more humane beauty can be found anywhere
  i spent a few months in a burn unit at st barnabas hospital in livingston new jersey where
 i got really great care at every
  turn  including good palliative care for my pain and one night it began to snow outside i
 remember my nurses complaining about driving through it 
 and there was no window in my room but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky 
 next day one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me
  i cannot tell you the rapture i felt holding that in my hand 
 and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin the
 miracle of it all the
 fascination as i watched it melt and turn into water in
  in that moment  
 just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether i lived or died 
 that little snowball packed all the inspiration i needed to both try to live and be ok if i did not in
 a hospital that 's a stolen moment  
 in my work over the years i 've known many people who were ready
  not because they had found some final peace or transcendence
  but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become
 in a word  cut off or ugly  
 there are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness and into ever
  older age  and we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami  
 we need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts
 in our population now is the time to create something new something
  i know we can because we have to the alternative is just unacceptable  
 and the key ingredients are known policy  education and training 
 systems  bricks and mortar 
 we have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with 
 we know for example from research what 's most important to people who are closer to death comfort
  unburdening to those they love existential peace  and a sense of wonderment and spirituality 
 over zen hospice 's nearly thirty years  
 we 've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail 
 little things aren 't so little
  take janette she finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to als well guess what she wants to start smoking again
 and french cigarettes if you please
  not out of some self destructive bent  but to feel her lungs filled while she has them  
 priorities change or kate she just wants
  know her dog austin is lying at the foot of her bed his
 cold muzzle against her dry skin  instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins she 's done that 
 sensuous aesthetic gratification where in a moment in an instant  we are rewarded for just
  so much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses  by way of the body
 the very thing doing the living and the dying  probably the most poignant room in the zen hospice guest house is our kitchen which is
 a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little 
  if anything at all but
 we realize we are providing sustenance on
 several levels  smell a symbolic plane  
 seriously with all the heavy duty stuff happening under our roof 
 one of the most tried and true interventions we know of is to
 bake cookies
  as long as we have our senses even just one
 we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human  connected
  imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia
  sensorial delights that say the things we don 't have words for impulses that make us stay present
 no need for a past or a future 
 so 
 if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue  
 then tending to dignity by way of the senses by way of the body
 the aesthetic realm is design cue number two now
 this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today  namely we need to lift our sights to set our sights on
 that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful  rather than just less horrible
  beneficence 
 here this gets right at the distinction between a disease centered and a patient or  human centered model of care
  and here is where caring becomes a creative  generative even playful act 
 play may sound like a funny word here
  also one of our highest forms of adaptation consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human  
 the need for food has birthed cuisine the
 need for shelter has given rise to architecture  the need for cover  fashion and for being subjected to the clock 
 well  
 we invented
 music  
 so  since dying is a necessary part of life what might we create with this fact
 by play i am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying  there are mountains of sorrow that cannot move  and one way or another  we will all kneel there  
 rather i am asking that we make
 space
 physical psychic room
  to allow life to play itself all the way out
 so that rather than just getting out of the way  aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end
 we can 't solve for death  i know some of you are working on this
  we can design towards it parts of me died early on and that 's something we can all say one way or another
 i got to redesign my life around this fact  and i tell you it has been a liberation
 to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left 
 like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment  all the while melting away
 if we
 love
 such moments ferociously  
 then maybe we can learn to live well not in spite of death  
 but because of it 
 let death be what takes us not
  lack of imagination
