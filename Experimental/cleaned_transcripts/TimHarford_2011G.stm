  the second world war a german prison camp and
 this man archie cochrane is a prisoner of war and a
  and he has a problem the problem is that the men under his care
 are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition
 that archie doesn 't really understand the symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin  
 but he doesn 't know whether it 's an infection whether it 's to do with malnutrition he doesn 't know how to cure it  
 and he 's operating in a hostile environment  and people do terrible things in wars
  the german camp guards  they 've got bored they 've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun 
 on one particular occasion one of the guards threw a grenade
 into the prisoners ' lavatory while it was full of prisoners  he said he heard suspicious laughter  
 and archie cochrane as the camp doctor was one of the first men in to clear up the mess 
 and one more thing
 archie was suffering from this illness himself  so the situation seemed pretty desperate but archie cochrane
 was a resourceful person 
 he 'd already smuggled vitamin c into the camp  and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black
  now some of you will be wondering what marmite is marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the british it looks like crude oil  it tastes  
 zesty 
 and importantly  it 's a rich source of vitamin
 so archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups he gives half of them vitamin c he gives half of them vitamin
  carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book 
 and after just a few days it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness  marmite is the cure  
 so cochrane then goes to the germans who are running the prison camp now you 've got to imagine at the moment forget this photo
  imagine this guy with this this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair he hasn 't been able to shave a sort of billy connolly figure 
 cochrane he starts ranting at these germans in this scottish accent in fluent german by the way but in a scottish accent
 and explains to them how german culture was the culture that gave schiller and goethe
 to the world  and he can 't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated and he vents his frustrations
  and then he goes back to his quarters  breaks down and weeps
 because he 's convinced that the situation is hopeless  but a young german doctor
 picks up archie cochrane 's exercise book
 and says to his colleagues this evidence is incontrovertible 
 if we don 't supply vitamins to the prisoners
 it 's a war crime 
 and the next morning supplies of vitamin b12 are delivered to the camp  and the prisoners begin to recover  
 now i 'm not telling you this story because i think archie cochrane is a dude  although archie cochrane is a dude  i 'm not
  even telling you the story because i think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy  
 although i think that would also be completely awesome 
 i 'm telling you this story because
 archie cochrane all his life  fought against a terrible affliction  
 and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive
  and he had a name for it he called it the god complex  
 now i can describe the symptoms of the god complex very very easily  so the symptoms of the complex are 
 no matter how complicated the problem  you have an absolutely overwhelming
 belief that you are infallibly right in your solution now archie was a doctor
  so he hung around with doctors a lot and doctors suffer from the god complex a lot
 now i 'm an economist i 'm not a doctor  but i see the god complex around me all the time in my fellow economists  
 i see it in our business leaders  i see it in the politicians we vote for
 people who in the face of an incredibly complicated world are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works
  and you know with the future billions that we 've been hearing about the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way 
 well let me give you an example  imagine for a moment that instead of tim harford in front of you there was hans rosling
 presenting his graphs  you know hans the mick jagger of ted and
 he 'd be showing you these amazing statistics these amazing animations and they are brilliant it 's wonderful work  but a typical hans rosling graph
 think for a moment not what it shows  but think instead about what it leaves out 
 so it 'll show you gdp per capita  population  longevity that 's
 about it so three pieces of data for each country
 three pieces of data three pieces of data is nothing i mean
  have a look at this graph this is produced by the physicist cesar hidalgo he 's at mit now you won 't be able to understand a word of it but this
 is what it looks like cesar has trolled the database of over five thousand different products 
 and he 's used techniques of network analysis
 to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products and it 's wonderful wonderful
  you show all these interconnections all these interrelations
 and i think it 'll be profoundly useful in understanding how it is that economies grow  brilliant work cesar and i
 tried to write a piece for the new york times magazine explaining how this works and what we learned is cesar 's work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine
 five thousand products that 's still nothing five thousand products imagine counting
  every product category in cesar hidalgo 's data imagine you had one second per product category in about the length of this session 
 you would have counted all five thousand now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in walmart 
 there are one hundred thousand there it would take you all
  now imagine trying to count every different specific product and service on sale in a major economy such as tokyo  london or new york it 's even more difficult in edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan if
 you wanted to count every product and service on offer in new york
 there are ten billion of them
 it would take you three hundred and seventeen years this is how complex the economy we 've created is and
 i 'm just counting toasters here i 'm not trying to solve the middle east
  problem  the complexity here is unbelievable and just a piece of context
 the societies in which our brains evolved had about three hundred products and services you could count them in five minutes  
 so this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us this perhaps is why we find the god complex so tempting we tend to retreat and say we can draw a picture  we can post some
  graphs  we get it we understand how this works and we don 't  we never do  
 now i 'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here i 'm not trying to say we we can 't solve complicated problems in a complicated world we clearly can 
 but the way we solve them is with humility to abandon the god complex and to actually use a
  and we we have a problem solving technique that works  now you show me a successful complex system  
 and i will show you a system that has evolved through trial and error  here 's an example 
 this baby was produced through trial and error  
 i realize that 's an ambiguous statement  maybe i should clarify it this baby is a human body
 it evolved what is evolution over millions of years  variation and selection  variation and selection
 trial and error 
 trial and error and it 's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error you could use it in an industrial
  's say you wanted to make detergent let 's say you 're unilever and you want to make detergent in a factory near liverpool how
 do you do it well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent  you pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle  you create a spray of detergent 
 then the spray dries it turns into powder  it falls to the floor  you scoop it up you put it in cardboard boxes  you sell it at a supermarket you make lots of money 
 how do you design
 that nozzle
 turns out to be very important  
 now if you ascribe to the god complex  what you do is you find yourself a little god  you find yourself a mathematician you find yourself a physicist somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid  and
 he will or she will calculate the optimal design of the
  now unilever did this
 and it didn 't work too complicated even this problem  too complicated  
 but the geneticist professor steve jones describes how unilever actually did solve this problem
 trial and error  variation and selection  you take a nozzle
 and you create ten random variations on the nozzle  you try out all ten  
 you keep the one that works best you create ten variations on that one  you try out all ten
  you keep the one that works best  you try out ten variations on that one you see how this works right 
 and after forty five generations  you have this incredible nozzle it looks a bit like a chess piece functions absolutely brilliantly  
 we have no idea
 why it works  no idea at all and
  the moment you step back from the god complex let 's just try to have a bunch of stuff let 's have a systematic way of determining what 's working and what 's not you can solve your problem  
 now
 this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize  and we 've heard a lot about how economies function 
 the u s economy is still the world 's greatest economy 
 how did it become the world 's greatest
  i could
 give you all kinds of facts and figures about the u s economy but i think the most salient one is this 
 ten percent of american businesses disappear
 every year  
 that is a huge failure rate it 's far higher than the failure rate of say americans ten percent of americans don 't disappear every year 
 which leads us to conclude american businesses fail faster than americans and therefore american businesses
 are evolving faster than americans
  and eventually they 'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets 
 if of course they haven 't already done so i sometimes wonder  
 but it 's this process of trial and error that explains
 this great divergence
  this incredible performance of western economies it didn 't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge  
 it 's come through trial and error  now i 've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months  and people sometimes say to me well
 tim it 's kind of obvious obviously trial and error is very important  obviously experimentation is very important  now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing so i say
 okay fine  you think it 's obvious 
 i will admit it 's obvious when
 schools
 start teaching children that there are some problems that don 't have a correct answer  stop giving them lists of
 questions every single one of which has an answer and there 's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher 's desk who knows all the answers  and if you can 't find the answers  you must be lazy or stupid 
 when schools stop doing that all the time i will admit that yes it 's obvious that trial and
  error is a good thing when a politician stands up
 campaigning for elected office and says i want to fix our health system  i want to fix our education system  i have no idea how to do it i 
 have half a dozen ideas  we 're going to test them out they 'll probably all fail then we 'll test some other ideas
  find some that work we 'll build on those we 'll get rid of the ones that don 't when a politician campaigns on that platform and more importantly when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician 
 then i will admit
 that it is obvious that trial and error works  and that thank you 
 until then until then i 'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex because it
 it 's so hard to admit our own fallibility it 's so uncomfortable and archie cochrane understood this as well as anybody
  there 's this one
 trial he ran many years after world war ii he wanted to test out
 the question of where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks should they recover in a
  unit in hospital  or should they recover at home 
 all the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down  
 they had the god complex in spades they knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients  and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment 
 nevertheless archie managed to get permission to do this he ran his trial and after the trial had been running for a little while  he gathered together all his
  colleagues around his table 
 and he said well gentlemen  we have some preliminary results  they 're not statistically significant 
 but we have something and it turns out that you 're right
 and i 'm wrong it is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home  they should be in hospital 
 and there 's this uproar and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying we always said
  you were unethical archie you 're killing people with your clinical trials you need to shut it down now shut it down at once and there 's this huge hubbub archie lets it die down 
 and then he says well that 's very interesting gentlemen because when i gave you the table of results  
 i swapped the two columns around 
 it turns out your hospitals are killing people and they should be at home would you like to close
  down the trial now or should we wait until we have robust results tumbleweed
 rolls through through the meeting room  
 but cochrane would do that kind of thing  and the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood
 it feels so much better to stand there
  in my own little world i am a god  i understand everything  i do not want to have my opinions challenged  i do not want to have my conclusions tested it feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law 
 cochrane understood that uncertainty that fallibility that being challenged  
 they hurt and you sometimes need to be shocked out of that  
 now i 'm not going to pretend that this is easy  it isn 't easy
 's incredibly painful and since i started talking about this subject and researching this subject 
 i 've been really haunted by something a japanese mathematician said on the subject
 so shortly after the war this young man  yutaka taniyama developed this amazing conjecture called the 
  conjecture  it turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving
  fermat 's last theorem in fact  it turns out it 's equivalent to proving fermat 's last theorem you prove one  you prove the other  
 but it was always a conjecture 
 taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true and shortly before his
  his friend goro shimura who worked on the mathematics with him many decades later reflected on taniyama 's life  
 he said 
 he was not a very careful person as a mathematician  
 he made a lot of mistakes  but he made mistakes in a good direction 
 i tried to emulate
  him  but i realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes
