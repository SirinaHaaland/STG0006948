  plant is called the llareta 
 what looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it
  this individual lives in the atacama desert in chile  and it happens to be three thousand years old  it also happens to be a relative of parsley 
 for the past five years i 've been researching working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are two thousand years old and older 
 the project is part art and part science there 's an environmental component  and i 'm also trying to
  a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale 
 i selected two thousand years as my minimum age because i wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there 
 what you 're looking at now is a tree called jomon sugi living on the remote island
  the tree was in part a catalyst for the project i 'd been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph  and then i heard about this tree that is two thousand one hundred and eighty years old and knew that i had to go visit it 
 it wasn 't until later when i was actually back home in new york that i got the idea for the project so it was the slow churn if you will  i think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art science and philosophy that allowed me
  to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on 
 so i started researching and to my surprise this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences  and perhaps naively i was surprised to find that there isn 't even an area 
 in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity  so what you 're looking at here is the rhizocarpon
  or map lichen  and this is around three thousand years old and lives in greenland  which is a long way to go for some lichens  
 visiting greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north it was very primal and more remote than anything i 'd ever experienced before
 and this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences one was when i had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord only to find that the archeologists
  i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found
  and it 's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e mail so i was literally left to my own devices
  but luckily it worked out obviously  but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected
  and then a few days later  we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite where the fish were so
  abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot long trout with your bare hands 
 it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet  
 and then of course there 's the lichens these lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years i think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective  
 and what you 're looking at here is an aerial photo take
  over eastern oregon  and if the title searching for armillaria death rings sounds ominous  it is the armillaria is actually a predatory fungus 
 killing certain species of trees in the forest it 's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the humongous fungus 
  so with the help of some biologists studying the fungus  i got some maps and some gps coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees  
 so i 'm not sure if there are any in this photo but i do know the fungus is down there  and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree  so that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood
  is the mycelial felt of the fungus  and what it 's doing it 's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients  
  so this strategy has served it pretty well it 's two thousand four hundred years old 
  find this one this is at about sixty feet or eighteen meters depth 
 and you 'll see there 's some damage to the surface of the coral that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it though luckily they lost interest before killing it 
 luckily still it seems to be out of harm 's way of the recent oil spill  but that being said we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet and
 the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen 
 now this is something that i think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet  
 this is clonal colony of quaking aspen trees living in utah that is literally eighty thousand years old  
 what looks like a forest is actually
  imagine that it 's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system so what you have is one giant interconnected genetically identical individual
 that 's been living for eighty thousand years  
 it also happens to be male and in theory immortal 
 laughter this is a clonal
  tree as well this is the spruce gran picea which at nine thousand five hundred and fifty years is a mere babe in the woods  the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection  
 i spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree  and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change as it 's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain  the vegetation zone is actually
  so we don 't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them  
 this is the fortingall yew
 no i 'm just kidding
 this is the fortingall yew 
 but i put that slide in there because i 'm often asked if there are any animals in the project and aside
  the oldest living tortoise so nowhere near two thousand 
 and then you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern iceland that reached four hundred and five
  it died in the lab as they were determining its age
 the most interesting discovery of late i think is the so called immortal jellyfish  which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity  
 so
 that being said it 's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild
  and back to the yew here so as you can see it 's in a churchyard it 's in scotland it 's behind a protective wall  and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around 
  the u k but if you do the math you 'll remember it 's actually the yew trees that were there first then the churches  
  and we saw a number of them and this is most likely the oldest it 's around two thousand and it 's called the sagole 
 i think of all of these organisms as palimpsests they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves  and they also contain records of natural and human events  
 and the baobabs in particular are a great
 example of this you can see that this one has
  names carved into its trunk  but it also records some natural events  so the baobabs as they get older tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out and this can create great natural shelters for animals 
 but they 've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses including a bar 
 a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree  
 and this brings me to another favorite of mine i think because it is just so unusual this plant is called the welwitschia and it
  lives only in parts of coastal namibia and angola  where it 's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea  
 and what 's more it 's actually a tree  it 's a primitive conifer you 'll
 notice that it 's bearing cones down the center  
 and what looks like two big heaps of leaves is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time
 and it actually never sheds those leaves  so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom  
 i spoke to a biologist at the kirstenbosch botanical garden in capetown to ask him
 where he thought this remarkable plant came from and his thought was that if you travel around namibia you see that there are a number of petrified forests and the
  the logs are all
 the logs are all giant coniferous trees  and yet there 's no sign of where they might have come from so
 his thought was that flooding in the north of africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago  and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment 
 this is what i think is the most poetic of the
  living things this is something called an underground forest  so i spoke to a botanist at the pretoria botanical garden who explained that certain species of trees have adapted 
 to this region it 's bushfelt region which is dry and prone to a lot of fires as so what these trees have done is if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree  and that this is ground level  imagine that
  thing that whole bulk of the tree  migrated underground and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface that way  when a fire roars through  it 's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed the tree can easily recover 
 these also tend to grow clonally the oldest of which is thirteen thousand years old 
  back in the u s there 's a couple plants of similar age  this is the clonal creosote bush which is around twelve thousand years old  if you 've been in the american west you know the creosote bush is pretty 
  ubiquitous  but that being said you see that this has this unique circular form  and what 's happening is it 's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape 
  and it 's one again that interconnected root system making it one genetically identical individual 
 well i think they 're friends
 this is the clonal mojave yucca it 's about a mile away  and it 's a little bit older than twelve thousand years and you see it has that similar circular form and there 's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it 
 and both of these the yucca and the creosote bush  live on bureau of land management land and that 's very different from being protected in a national park in fact this land is
  designated for recreational all terrain vehicle use 
 so now i want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet  this is siberian actinobacteria which is between four 
  hundred thousand and six hundred thousand years old  this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life
  on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours  
 and what they found by doing research into the permafrost was this bacteria 
 but what 's unique about it is that it 's doing dna repair below freezing  and what that means is that it 's not dormant it 's actually been living and growing for half a million
  it 's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things because if the permafrost melts  it won 't survive  
 this is a map that i 've put together of the oldest living things so you can get a sense of where they are you see they 're all over the world the blue flags represent things that i 've already photographed and the reds are places that i 'm still trying to get to 
 you 'll see also there 's a flag on antarctica i 'm trying to
  which lives on the antarctic peninsula  so i probably have about two more years left on this project
 on this phase of the project but after five years i really feel like i know what 's at the heart of this work 
 the oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future 
 they 've survived for millennia
  millennia in desert in the permafrost at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean 
 they 've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments  but now some of them are in jeopardy  and they can 't just get up and get out of the way
 it 's my hope that by going to find these organisms that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the
  foreseeable future  thank you
