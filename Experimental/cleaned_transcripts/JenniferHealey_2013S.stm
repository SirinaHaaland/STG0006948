  one of the things that we don 't like to think about 
 but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world
 betrays the fact that we
  know this to be true car accidents are the leading cause of death
 in people ages sixteen to nineteen in the united states leading cause of death
 and seventy five percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol  so what
  no one can say for sure  but i i remember my first accident i was a young driver out on the highway  
 and the car in front of me i saw the brake lights go on i 'm like okay all right this guy is slowing down i 'll slow down too i step on the brake 
 but no this guy isn 't slowing down this guy is stopping  dead stop dead stop on the highway it was just going sixty five to zero  
 i slammed on the brakes i felt the abs kick in and
 the car is still going
  not going to stop and i know it 's not going to stop  and the air bag deploys the car is totaled and fortunately no one was hurt but
 i had no idea that car was stopping  and i think we can do a lot better than that i think we can transform
 the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other
  want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now 
 get into your car close the door you 're in a glass bubble 
 you can 't really directly sense the world around you you 're in this extended body you
 're tasked with navigating it down partially seen roadways in and amongst other metal giants at super human
  and all you have to guide you are your two eyes  okay so that 's all you have eyes that weren 't really designed for this task but
 then people ask you to do things like you want to make a lane change what 's the first thing they ask you do 
 take your eyes off the road that 's right 
 stop looking where you 're going  turn  check your blind spot  and drive down the road without looking where you 're going  
 you and everyone else this is the safe way to
  drive  why do we do this because we have to we have to make a choice do i look here
 or do i look here what 's more important  and usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road  
 but occasionally
 we miss something  occasionally we sense something wrong or
  and i believe that i believe that we can only watch so much 
 but the technology exists now that can help us improve that 
 in the future  with cars exchanging data with each other  we will be able to see
 not just three cars ahead and three cars behind to the right and left all at the same time  bird 's eye view
 will actually be able to see into those cars we will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us to see how fast that guy 's going or stopping if
 that guy 's going down to zero i 'll know 
 and with computation and algorithms and predictive models we will be able to see the future
  you may think that 's impossible how can you predict the future that 's really hard actually no with cars it 's not impossible cars are three dimensional objects
 that have a fixed position and velocity they travel down roads 
 often they travel on pre published routes it 's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions
 about where a car 's going to be in the near future  even if when you 're in your car
 and some motorcyclist comes bshoom
  hour down lane splitting i know you 've had this experience
 that guy didn 't just come out of nowhere that guy 's been on the road probably for the last half hour 
 right i mean  somebody 's seen him  
 ten twenty thirty miles back someone 's seen that guy and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map he 's on the map
 position velocity
  he 'll continue going eighty five miles an hour you 'll know  because your car will know because that other car will have whispered something in his ear like by the way 
 five minutes motorcyclist watch out 
 you can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave i mean they 're newtonian objects that 's very nice about them
  so how do we get there  
 we can start with something as simple as sharing our position data
  between cars just sharing gps 
 if i have a gps and a camera in my car i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i 'm going 
 with computer vision i can estimate where the cars around me are sort of and where they 're going  
 and same with the other cars they can have a precise idea of where they are and sort of a vague idea of where
 the other cars are what happens if two cars share that data if they talk to each other
  i can tell you exactly what happens  both models improve everybody wins  professor bob wang and his team
 have done computer simulations of what happens
 when fuzzy estimates combine  even in light traffic when cars just share gps data and we 've moved this research
 out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now
  now on these robots stereo cameras gps and the two dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems  we also attach
 a discrete short range communication radio  and the robots talk to each other  when these robots come at each other  they track each other 's position
 precisely and they can avoid each other we 're now adding more and more robots into the mix
  and we encountered some problems one of the problems when you get too much chatter it 's hard to process all the packets  so you have to prioritize and that 's where the predictive model helps you 
 if your robot cars are all tracking
 the predicted trajectories you don 't pay as much attention to those packets you prioritize the one guy
 who seems to be going a little off course that guy could be a problem  and you can predict the new trajectory
  know that he 's going off course you know how 
 and you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way  and we wanted to do how can we best alert everyone how can these cars whisper you need to get out of the way 
 well it depends on two things one the ability of the car 
 and second the ability of the driver 
 if one guy has a really great car
  not probably in the best position to react in an emergency  so we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling  
 and now using a series of three cameras  
 we can detect if a driver is looking forward looking away looking down on the phone or having a cup of coffee
  we can predict the accident
  which cars are in the best position to move out of the way
 to calculate the safest route for everyone  fundamentally these technologies exist today  
 i think the biggest problem that that we face
 is our own willingness to share our data 
 i think it 's a very disconcerting notion this idea that our cars will be watching us talking about us to other cars 
 that we 'll be going down the road in a sea of
  gossip 
 but i believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy just like right now  when i look at your car from the outside i don 't
 really know about you if i
 look at your license plate number i don 't really know who you are  i believe our cars can talk about us
 behind our backs laughter
 and i think it 's going to be a great thing
 i want you to consider for a moment if you really don 't want the distracted teenager behind you
 to know that you 're braking that you 're coming to a dead stop  
 by sharing our data willingly  we can do what 's best for everyone  so let your car gossip about you it
 's going to make the roads a lot safer
