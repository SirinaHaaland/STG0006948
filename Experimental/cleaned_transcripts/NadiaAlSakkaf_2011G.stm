  brought us images from the yemen times  and take us through those and introduce us to
 another yemen nadia al sakkaf well i 'm glad to be here and i would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in yemen
  picture shows a revolution started by women and it shows women and men
 leading a mixed protest the other picture
 is the popularity of the real need for change so many people are there  the intensity of
 of the upspring this picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training
  for education these women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the constitution  
 i love this picture i just wanted to show that over sixty percent of the yemeni population are fifteen years and below and they were excluded from decision making
 and now they are in the forefront of the news  raising the flag  english
  jeans and
 tights and an english
 expression the ability to share with the world what is going on in our own country  and
 expression also  it has brought talents yemenis are using cartoons and
  each other about what 's going on obviously there 's always the dark side of it  and this is just
 one of the less gruesome pictures of
 of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay  
 the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing and finally lots of people are
 saying that yemen 's revolution is going to break the country 
 is it going to be so many different countries is it going to be another somalia but we want to tell the world that no under the one flag we 'll still remain as yemeni people pm 
 thank you for those images  
 nadia and they do in many ways tell a different story than the story of yemen the one that is often in the news and yet you yourself defy all those
 characterizations so let
 talk about the personal story for a moment your father is is murdered 
 the yemen times already has a strong reputation
 in yemen as an independent english language newspaper  
 how did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities
 of running a newspaper especially in such times of conflict
  first warn you that i 'm not the the traditional yemeni girl i 've guessed you 've already noticed this by now 
 laughter in yemen most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life 
 but there 's so much potential i wish i could show you my
  yemen through my eyes then you would know that there 's so much to it 
 and i was privileged because i was born into a family my father would always encourage the boys and the girls he would say we are equal and
 he was such an extraordinary man and even my mother i owe it to my family 
  i studied in india and in my third year i started becoming confused
 because i was yemeni  but i was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college and i went back home and i said 
 daddy i don 't know who i am i 'm not a yemeni i 'm not an indian and he said you are the bridge 
 and that is something i will keep in my heart forever so since then i 've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
 i don 't think so na but
 it just helps tell
 that some people are change agents in the society and when i became 
  editor in chief after my brother actually my father passed away in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and then my brother until two thousand and five
 and everybody was betting that i will not be able to do it what 's this young girl coming in and showing off because
 it 's her family business or something it was very hard at first i didn 't want to clash with people 
 but with all due respect to all the men and the older men especially 
 they did not want me around  
 it was very hard you know to impose
 my authority  but
 a woman 's got to do what a woman 's got to do
 and in the first year  i had to fire half of the men 
 brought in more women  brought in younger men and
  the other thing is that it 's about professionalism  it 's about proving who you are and what you can do 
 and i don 't know if i 'm going to be boasting now but in two thousand and six alone we won three international awards one of them is the ipi
 free media pioneer award  so
 that was the answer to all the yemeni people
  i want to score a point here because my husband is in the room over there if you could please stand up [ unclear ] 
 he has been very supportive of me pm and
 we should point out that he works with you as well at the
 paper but in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have you have become a bridge between
 an older and traditional society
  and the one that you are now creating at the paper and so along with changing who worked there  you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into 
 in particular with women and it has to do with outside image dress  
  of yemeni women is a lot of black and covered
  veiled women and this is true and a lot of it is because
 women are not able are not free to show their face to their self it 's a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men the grandparents and so on  
 and it 's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say
  much contributing to this family or more than you are and the more
 empowered the women become the more they are able to remove the veil for example or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel 
 so
 the other face of yemen is actually one that lies behind
  it 's economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it and i have done this
 throughout my work  i 've tried to encourage young girls  we started with you can take it off in the office
 and then after that you can take it off on assignments because i didn 't believe a journalist can be a journalist with with
 how can you talk to people if you have your face covered  and so on it 's just a movement  and i am a role model in yemen a lot of people look up to me
  a lot of young girls look up to me  and i need to prove to them that  yes you can still be married you can still be a mother and you can still be respected within the society  but at the same time that doesn 't mean you [ should ] just
 be one of the crowd  you can be yourself and have your face pm but by putting yourself personally out there both
 projecting a different image of yemeni women but also what
 have made possible for the women who work at the paper
 has this put you in personal danger na well the yemen times  across twenty years has been through so much 
 we 've suffered prosecution the paper was closed down more than three times it 's an independent newspaper but
 tell that to the people in charge they think that if there 's
  anything against them then we are being an opposition newspaper and
 very very difficult times some of my reporters were arrested  we had some court cases my father was assassinated
  today  we are
 in a much better situation we 've created the credibility  and in times of revolution or change like today  it is very important for independent media to have a
  voice  it 's very important for for you to go to yementimes com and it 's very important to listen to our voice
  and this is probably something i 'm going to
 share with you in western media probably and how
 there 's a lot of stereotypes thinking of yemen in one single frame this is what yemen is all about and
 that 's not fair it 's not fair for me it 's not fair for my country a lot of reporters come to yemen and they want to write a story on al qaeda or terrorism  
 and
 i just wanted to to share with you there 's one reporter that came he wanted to do a documentary on what his editors
  and he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me hip hop
 that there are young yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and
  it definitely does give a different image of yemen  you spoke about the responsibility of the press and certainly when we look at the ways in which we
 separated ourselves from others  and we 've created fear and danger often from lack of of knowledge lack of real understanding 
 how do you see the way that the western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region but in particular in your country na 
  you fear what you don 't know  and you hate what you fear 
 so it 's about the lack of research  basically it 's almost do your homework 
 some involvement and you cannot do
 parachute reporting just jump into a country for two days and think that you 've done your homework and a story so i wish
 that the world would know my yemen
  my country my people i am an example and there are others like me we may not be that many but if we are promoted as
 a good  positive example there will be others
 men and women who can eventually bridge the gap again coming to the bridge between yemen and the world and telling
 first about
 recognition and then about communication and compassion  i think yemen is going to be in a very
 bad situation in the next two or three years  it 's natural  but after the two years which is a price we are willing to pay  we are going to stand
  again on our feet but in the new yemen with a younger and more empowered people
 democratic pm 
 nadia i think 
  you 've just given us a very different view of yemen and certainly
  embrace and be grateful for and the very best of luck to you
