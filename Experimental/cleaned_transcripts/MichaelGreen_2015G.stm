  do you think the world is going to be a better place next year in the next decade can we
 end hunger achieve gender equality
  climate change all in the next fifteen years  
 well according to the governments of the world yes we can 
 in the last few days  the leaders of the world  meeting at the un in new york  agreed a new set of global goals for the development of the world to two thousand and thirty  
 and here they are these goals are the product
 of a massive consultation exercise the global goals
 are who we humanity want to be 
 now that 's the plan  
 but can we get there can this vision for a better world really be achieved 
 well i 'm here today because we 've run the numbers  
 and the answer
  is that maybe we actually can but not with business as usual
  now the idea that the world is going to get a better place may seem a little fanciful 
 watch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards not forwards 
 and let 's be frank it 's pretty easy to be skeptical about grand announcements coming out of the un  
 but please i invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment
 because back in two thousand and one the un agreed another set of goals  the millennium development goals 
 and the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people living in poverty
 by two thousand and fifteen the target was to take from a baseline of one thousand nine hundred and ninety 
  percent of the world 's population lived in poverty to get to eighteen percent poverty
 this year 
 did we hit this target well
 no  we didn 't  we exceeded it this year global poverty is going to fall to twelve percent 
 now that 's still not good enough and the world does still have plenty of problems  but the pessimists
  and doomsayers who say that the world can 't get better are simply wrong 
 so how did we achieve this success well a lot of it was because of economic growth 
 some of the biggest reductions in poverty were in countries such as china and india  which have seen
 rapid economic growth in recent years so can we pull off the same trick again can economic growth get us to the global goals
  well  to answer that question we need to benchmark where the world is today against the global goals and figure out how far we have to travel  
 but that ain 't easy because the global goals aren 't just ambitious  they 're also pretty complicated 
 over seventeen goals there are then one
  and literally hundreds of indicators also  while some of the goals are pretty specific
 end hunger
 others are a lot vaguer
 promote peaceful and tolerant societies  
 so to help us with this benchmarking  i 'm going to use a tool called the social progress index what this does is measures all the stuff the global goals are trying
  but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time 
 the social progress index basically asks three fundamental questions about a society  
 first of all does everyone have the basic needs of survival food water  shelter  safety  secondly does everyone have the building blocks of a better life education information
  and a sustainable environment  
 and does everyone have the opportunity to improve their lives through rights  freedom of choice  freedom from discrimination and access to the world 's most advanced knowledge 
 the social progress index sums all this together using fifty two indicators to create an aggregate score on a scale of zero to one hundred 
 and what we find is that there 's a wide diversity of performance in the world today  the highest performing country
  norway  scores eighty eight the lowest performing country  central african republic scores thirty one 
 and we can add up all the countries together weighting for the different population sizes  and that global score is sixty one 
 in concrete terms that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of cuba or kazakhstan today
 that 's where we are today sixty one out of one hundred  what do we have to get to to achieve the global goals  
 now the global goals are certainly ambitious  but they 're not about turning the world into norway in just fifteen years  
 so having looked at the numbers my estimate is that a score of 
 would not only be a giant
  it would also count as hitting the global goals target  
 so there 's our target seventy five out of one hundred can we get there well
 the social progress index can help us calculate this 
 because as you might have noticed there are no economic indicators in there there 's no gdp or economic growth in the social progress index model  
 and what that lets us do is understand the relationship between economic growth
 and social progress
 let me show you on this chart  so here on the vertical axis  i 've put social progress the stuff the global goals are trying to achieve higher is better and then
 on the horizontal axis is gdp per capita further to the right means richer  
 and in there i 'm now going to put all the countries of the world each one represented
  and on top of that i 'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship 
 and what this tells us is that as we get richer social progress does tend to improve 
 however as we get richer  each extra dollar of gdp is buying us less and less social progress  
 and now we can use this information to start building our
  we have a social progress score of sixty one and a gdp per capita of $ fourteen thousand and the place we 're trying to get to remember 
  global goals target  so here we are today $ fourteen thousand per capita gdp  how rich are we going to be in two thousand and thirty that 's what we need to know next 
 well 
  the best forecast we can find comes from the us department of agriculture  which forecasts three point one percent average global economic growth over the next fifteen years  
 which means that in two thousand and thirty  if they 're right 
 per capita gdp will be about $ twenty three thousand  
 so now the question is if we get that much richer  how much social progress are we going to get  
 well  we asked a team of economists at deloitte who checked and crunched the numbers  and they came back and
  if the world
 world 's average wealth goes from $ fourteen thousand a year to $ twenty three thousand a year social progress is going to increase from sixty one
 to sixty two point four 
 just sixty two point four just a tiny increase 
 now this seems a bit strange economic growth seems to have really helped
  in the fight against poverty  but it doesn 't seem to be having much impact on trying to get to the global goals  so what 's going on 
 well i think there are two things  the first is that in a way we 're the victims of our own success  we 've used up the easy wins from economic growth and now we 're moving on to harder problems  
  we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits there are costs to the environment costs from new health problems like obesity 
 so that 's the bad news we 're not going to get to the global goals just by getting richer  
 so are the pessimists right 
 well maybe not because the social progress index also has some very good news  
 let me take you back to that regression line so this is the average relationship between gdp and social progress
  and this is what our last forecast was based on but as you saw already there is actually lots of noise around this trend line what
 that tells us quite simply is that gdp is not destiny  
 we have countries that are underperforming on social progress
  relative to their wealth 
 russia has lots of natural resource wealth but lots of social problems  
 china has boomed economically  but hasn 't made much headway on human rights or environmental issues 
 india has a space program and millions of people without toilets 
 now on the other hand we have countries 
  on social progress relative to their gdp
  costa rica has prioritized education health and environmental sustainability and
 as a result it 's achieving a very high level of social progress  despite only having a rather modest gdp 
 and costa rica 's not alone 
 from poor countries like rwanda to richer countries like new zealand  we see that it 's possible to get lots of social progress  even if your gdp is not so great  
 and that 's really important  because it tells us
  two things  first of all it tells us that
 we already in the world have the solutions to many of the problems that the global goals are trying to solve 
 it also tells us that we 're not slaves to gdp 
 our choices matter if we prioritize the well being of people then we can make a lot more progress than our gdp might expect  
 how much
  enough to get us to the global goals  
 well let 's look at some numbers  what we know already the world today is scoring sixty one on social progress  and the place we want to get to is seventy five 
 if we rely on economic growth alone  we 're going to get to sixty two point four  so 
  let 's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress the russia china indias just up to the average how much social
  progress does that get us well that takes us to sixty five 
 it 's a bit better  
 but still quite a long way to go  so let 's get a little bit more optimistic and say what if every country gets a little bit better at turning its wealth into well being 
 well then we get to sixty seven 
 and now let 's be even bolder
  what if every country in the world chose to be like costa rica in prioritizing human well being using its wealth for the well being of its citizens well then we get to nearly seventy three 
 very close to the global goals  
 can we achieve the global goals  certainly not with business as usual  
 even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there if it just raises the
  if we 're going to achieve the global goals we have to do things differently  we have to prioritize social progress  and really scale solutions around the world  
 i believe the global goals are a historic opportunity because the world 's leaders have promised to deliver them 
 let 's not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism let 's hold them to that promise
  we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable  tracking their progress all the way through the next fifteen years  
 and i want to finish by showing you a way to do that called the people 's report card 
 the people 's report card brings together all this data into a simple framework that we 'll all be familiar with from our school days to hold them to account 
 it grades our performance on the global goals on a scale from f to a
 where f is humanity at its worst and a is humanity at its best our world today is scoring
 a c 
 the global goals are all about getting to an a  
 and that 's why we 're going to be updating the people 's report card annually for the world and for all the countries of the world so we can hold our leaders to account
 to achieve this target and fulfill
 this promise 
 because getting to the global goals will only happen if we do things differently  if our leaders do things differently 
 and for that  to happen that needs us to demand it 
 so let 's reject business as usual 
  just one question the millennium development goals established fifteen years ago they were kind of applying to every country but it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging
  the new global goals are explicitly universal 
 they ask for every country to show action and to show progress how can i as a private citizen use the report card to
 to create pressure for action michael green this is a really important point it 's a big shift in priorities it 's no longer about poor countries and just poverty it 's about every country  and every country is going to have challenges in getting to the global goals  even i 'm sorry to say bruno
  switzerland has got to work to do and so that 's why we 're going to produce these report cards in two thousand and sixteen for every country in the world then we can really see how are we doing and it 's not going to be 
  rich countries scoring straight a 's  and that then i think is to provide a point of focus for people to start demanding
