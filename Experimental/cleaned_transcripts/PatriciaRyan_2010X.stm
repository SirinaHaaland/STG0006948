  you think i 've lost my way and somebody 's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat 
  come to visit the children 
 how long are you staying 
 well actually i hope for a while longer yet  i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over thirty years
 now that statistic
 is quite shocking  and i want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of english  
 i want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi  
 and one fine day she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary  but it was she who ended up learning all
  the arabic words for the local plants as well as their uses medicinal uses cosmetics cooking  herbal 
 how did those students get all that knowledge of course from their grandparents and even their 
 it 's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations but sadly
  today languages are dying at an unprecedented rate a language dies every fourteen days 
 now at the same time english is the undisputed global language  
 could there be a connection well i don 't know  but i do know that i 've seen a lot of changes  when i first came out to the gulf i came to kuwait
 in the days when it was still a hardship
 actually not that long ago that is a little bit too early  
 but nevertheless  i was recruited by the british council along with about  twenty five other teachers  and we were the first  non muslims to teach in the state schools there in kuwait 
 we were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education
  and of course the u k benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth  okay  now
 this is the major change that i 've seen how teaching english has morphed
 from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today no longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum
 and no longer the sole domain of mother england it has become a bandwagon for every english speaking nation on earth  
 and why not after all the best
 education according to the latest world university rankings is to be found in the universities of the
  everybody wants to have an english education naturally  but if you 're not a native speaker you have to pass a test  now can it be right
 to reject a student on linguistic ability alone  perhaps you have a computer scientist who 's a genius would he need the same language as a lawyer for example  
  i don 't think so 
 we english teachers reject them all the time we put a stop sign  and we stop them in their tracks they can 't pursue their dream any longer ' til they get english  
 now
 let me put it this way  if i met
 a monolingual dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer  would i stop him from entering my british university i don 't think so
  indeed that is exactly what we do we english teachers are the gatekeepers  
 and you have to satisfy us first that your english is good enough  
 now it can be dangerous to give too much power
 to a narrow segment of
  i hear you say 
 what about the research it 's all in english 
 so the books are in english the journals are done in english  
 but that is a self fulfilling prophecy it feeds the english requirement  and so it goes on i ask you what happened to translation 
 if you think about the islamic golden age
  there was lots of translation then they translated from latin and greek
 into arabic into persian  and then it was translated on into the germanic languages of europe and the romance languages 
 and so light shone upon the dark ages of europe 
 now don 't get me wrong i am not against teaching english all you english teachers out there
  i love it that we have a global language we need one today more than ever  but i am against using it as a barrier 
 do we really want to end up with six hundred languages and the main one being english or chinese  
 we need more than that where do we draw the line this system
  and i want to remind you that the the giants upon whose shoulders today 's intelligentsia stand
 did not have to have english  they didn 't have to pass an english test case in point  einstein he by the
  way was considered remedial at school because he was in fact dyslexic 
 but fortunately for the world he did not have to pass an english test because they didn 't start until 
 with toefl the american test of english  now
 it 's exploded there are lots and lots of tests of english and millions and millions of students take these tests every year
 now you might think you and me those fees aren 't bad they 're okay but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people 
 so immediately we 're rejecting them it
 brings to mind a headline i saw recently education the great divide 
 now i get it i understand why people would want to focus on english  
 they want to give their children
  best chance in life 
 and to do that they need a western education 
 because of course the best jobs go to people out of the western universities that i put on earlier it 's a circular thing  
 okay  let me tell you a story about two scientists two english scientists
  they were doing
 an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals  
 but they couldn 't get the results they wanted they really didn 't know what to do 
 until along came a german scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does german
  if you can 't think a thought you are stuck  but if
 another language can think that thought then by cooperating we can achieve and learn so much more 
 my daughter came to england from kuwait she had studied science and mathematics in arabic
  it into english at her grammar school and she was
 the best in the class at those subjects  which tells us
 that when students come to us from abroad  
 we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know  and they know it in their own language  
 when a language dies we don 't know what we lose with that language this is i don 't know if you saw it on cnn
  recently they gave the heroes award to a young kenyan shepherd boy
 who couldn 't study at night in his village like all the village children because the kerosene lamp it had smoke and it damaged his eyes  
 and anyway there was never enough kerosene because what does a dollar a day buy for
  and now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home 
 when he
 received his award he said these lovely words the children can lead africa from what it is today a dark continent to
 a light continent a simple idea  but it could have such far reaching consequences 
 people who have no light whether it 's physical or metaphorical  cannot pass our exams  
 and we can never know what they know  
 let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark let us celebrate
  diversity mind your language  use it to spread great ideas
