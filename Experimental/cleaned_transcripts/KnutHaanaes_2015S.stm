  here are two reasons companies fail  they only do more of the same 
 or they only do what 's new to me the real
  quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities exploration and exploitation 
 both are necessary  but it can be too much of a good thing 
 consider facit 
 i 'm actually old enough to remember them
 facit was a fantastic company  they were born deep in the swedish forest  and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world
  used them  
 and what did  facit do when the electronic calculator came along they continued doing exactly the same 
 in six months they went from maximum revenue  and they were gone  
 gone to me the irony
 about the
  did too much exploitation 
 but exploration can go wild too a few years back i worked closely alongside a european biotech company let 's call them
 applications that promised to diagnose even cure  certain forms of blood cancer 
 every day was about creating something new  they were extremely innovative  
 and the mantra was when we only get it right or even we want it perfect 
 the sad thing is before they became perfect even
 good enough
  enough they became obsolete
  oncosearch did too much exploration  i first heard about exploration and exploitation
 about fifteen years ago when i worked as a visiting scholar at stanford university  the founder of the idea is is jim march
  and to me the power of the idea is is its practicality 
 exploration 
 exploration is about coming up with what 's new  
 it 's about search it 's about discovery it 's about new products it 's about new innovations 
 it 's about
 changing our frontiers our heroes are people who have done exploration 
  i come from norway all our heroes are explorers  and they deserve to be 
 we all know that exploration is risky  we don 't know the answers  we don 't know if we 're going to find them  and we know that the risks are high 
 exploitation is the opposite exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good
  better exploitation is about making our trains run on time it 's about making good products faster and cheaper 
 exploitation is not risky
 in the short term  but if we only exploit it 's very risky in the long term  
 and i think we all have memories of the
 famous pop groups who keep singing the same
  songs again and again  until they become obsolete or even pathetic that 's the risk of exploitation 
 so if we take a long term perspective  we explore 
 if we take a short term perspective  we exploit  small children they explore all day all day it 's about exploration
  as we grow older  we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on 
 the same goes for companies 
 companies become by nature less innovative as they become more competent  
 and this is of course a big worry to ceos  and i hear very often questions phrased in different ways
  example how can i both
 effectively run and reinvent my company 
 or how can i make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis 
 so doing one well is difficult doing both well as the same time is art pushing both exploration and exploitation
  so one thing we 've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time in parallel  
 but when they do the payoffs are huge  
 so we have lots of great examples we have
  we have lego going into animated films  toyota creating the hybrids  unilever pushing into sustainability there are lots of examples  and the benefits are huge
  why is balancing so difficult i think it 's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are 
 so i 'll talk about two but there are many
  so let 's talk about the perpetual search trap  
 we discover something but we don 't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work  so instead of staying with it we create something new 
  but the same goes for that then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated
  in companies  we see this in the public sector as well we all know that any kind of effective reform of
 education research  health care even defense takes ten  fifteen maybe twenty years to work  
 but still we change much more often 
 we really don 't give
  the success trap  
 they literally held the future in their hands  but they couldn 't see it they were simply so good at making what they loved doing that they wouldn 't change 
 we are like that too when we know something well it 's difficult to change
  bill gates has said success is a lousy teacher it seduces us into thinking we cannot fail 
 that 's the challenge with success  
 so i think there are some lessons  and i think they apply to us  and they apply to our companies
 the first lesson is get ahead of the crisis  
 and any company that 's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance
 in the future 
 netflix they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution  but they always and i think they will always keep pushing for the next battle 
 i see other companies that say i 'll win the next innovation cycle  whatever it takes 
  second one think in multiple time scales  i 'll share a chart with you and i think it 's a wonderful one 
 any company we look at taking a one year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company  innovation typically accounts for only about thirty percent  
 so when we think one year  innovation isn 't really that important  
 move ahead take a 10 year perspective on the same company
  ability to renew account for seventy percent  
 but companies can 't choose they need to fund the journey and lead the long term  
 third  
 invite talent  
 i don 't think it 's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves  i think it 's a team sport  i think we need to allow challenging 
 i think
 the mark
 of a great company is being open to be challenged  and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge  
 i think that 's also what good parenting is about 
 last one be skeptical of success  
 maybe it 's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in rome when the generals after a big
  victory were given their celebration riding into rome on the carriage  they always had a companion
 whispering in their ear remember you 're only human 
 so i hope i made the point  balancing exploration and exploitation
 has a huge payoff  but it 's difficult  and we need to be conscious
 i want to just point out two questions that i think are useful first question is  looking at your own company 
 in which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps 
 of just going on autopilot  
 and what can
  second question is when did i
 explore something new last  and what kind of effect did it have on me 
 is that something i should do more of in my case yes  
 so let me leave you with with this whether you 're an explorer
 by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know 
 don 't forget the beauty is in the balance 
 thank you
