  it 's a simple idea about nature   i want to say a word for nature because we haven 't talked that much about it
 the last couple days i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals
  and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that i have found
  really nothing more than a literary conceit it 's not a technology it 's very powerful for i think changing our relationship to the natural world
 and to the other species on whom we depend  
 and that tool is very simply as chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants ' or the animals ' point of view it
 's not my idea other people have hit on it
  but i 've tried to take it to some new places
 let me tell you where i got it like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools i use i found it in the garden
 i 'm a very devoted gardener 
 and there was a day about seven years ago  i was planting potatoes it was the first week of may this is new england when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom they 're just white clouds above
  i was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it 
 and the bees were working on this tree  bumblebees just making this thing vibrate and one of the things i really like about gardening
 is that it doesn 't take all your concentration you really can 't get hurt it 's not like woodworking
 and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question i asked myself
  that afternoon in the garden working alongside that bumblebee was what did i and that bumblebee
 have in common  how was our role in this garden similar and different  and i realized we actually had quite a bit in common  both of us were
 disseminating the genes of one species and not another  and both of us probably if i can imagine the bee 's point of view
 thought we were calling the shots  i had decided what kind of potato i wanted to plant
 i had picked my yukon gold or yellow finn or whatever it was
 and
 i had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country brought it  and i was planting it 
 and that bee no doubt assumed that it had decided i 'm going for that apple tree  i 'm going for that blossom
  'm going to get the nectar and i 'm going to leave we have a grammar that suggests
 that 's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me  i plant
 the potatoes  i weed the garden  i domesticate the species  but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar
 is nothing more than a
  course the bee thinks he 's in charge or she 's in charge but we know better we know
 that what 's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated
 by that flower and when i say manipulated i 'm talking about in a darwinian sense right i mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent
  that has lured that bee in and the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar and also picking up some powder on its leg  and going off to the next
 blossom the bee is not calling the shots  and i realized then i wasn 't either i had been seduced by that potato and not another
 into planting its
 into spreading its genes giving it a little bit more habitat
  and that 's when i got the idea which was well what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention 
 not as a human technology but as a  co evolutionary development
 in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically deforest the
  the competition of grasses right
  and suddenly everything looked different and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience  i had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book this was a book about gardening
 that
 lawns were nature under culture 's boot that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex  
 and that 's what the lawn was
  but then i realized no this is exactly what the grasses want us to do i 'm a dupe  i 'm a dupe of the lawns whose
 goal in life
 is to outcompete the trees who they compete with for sunlight and so by getting us to mow the lawn 
 we keep the trees from coming back which in
 in new england happens very very quickly  so i started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about
  it called the botany of desire and
 i realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees
 that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry
 what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug
  cannabis cross has something to say about us 
 and that wouldn 't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world
  now the test of any idea i said it was a literary conceit
 is what does it get us and when you 're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how
 does it meet the aldo leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that
 leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction
  and i would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some
 entertaining insights about
 about human desire
  as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species ' points of view
 helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is and this is in the realm of
 intellectual history which is that we have this darwinian revolution
 one hundred and fifty years ago ugh mini me 
 we have this intellectual this darwinian revolution in which thanks to darwin we figured out we are
  just one species among many  evolution is working on us the same way it 's working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting  
 we are really in the fiber the fabric of life but the weird thing is  we have not absorbed this lesson one hundred and fifty years later  none of us really believes this 
 we are still cartesians
 the children of descartes who believe that subjectivity
  consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another 
 as soon as you start seeing things from the plant 's point of view or the animal 's point of view you realize
 that the real literary conceit is that
 is the idea that nature
  that consciousness is everything
 and that 's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species ' points of view
 is a cure for the disease of human self importance you suddenly realize that consciousness
 which we value and we consider 
 the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools
  for getting along in the world 
 and it 's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there 's a comedian who said well 
 who 's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important 
 well consciousness so
 when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they 're just as interesting i 'll give you two examples
  lima bean does when it 's attacked by
 spider mites  it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world
 and summons another species of mite
 that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have
 consciousness tool making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond
  we can imagine their complexity their sophistication is
 something to really marvel at and i think it 's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty thousand or fifty thousand human genes
 and we came out with only twenty three thousand just to give you grounds for comparison
  so who 's the more sophisticated species well we 're all equally sophisticated we 've been evolving evolving just as long 
 just along different paths
  so  cure for self importance way to sort of make us feel the darwinian
 idea  and that 's really what i do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people feel what we know
  tell stories that actually help us think ecologically  now the other use of this is practical and i 'm going to take you to a farm right now  
 because i used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what i learned in fact is that we are all now  being manipulated by corn 
 and the talk you heard about ethanol
  to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense 
 applause it is part of corn 's
 corn 's scheme for world domination 
 and you will see  the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we 've decided ethanol is going to help us
  it 's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are
 in charge and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want  
 let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia i went looking for a farm
 where these
 ideas about looking at things from the species ' point of view are actually implemented  and i found it in a man the farmer 's name is joel salatin
 and i spent a week as an apprentice on his farm  and i took away from this some of the most hopeful news
 about our relationship to nature that i 've ever come across in twenty five years of writing about nature 
 and that is this the farm is called polyface which means  the idea is he 's got six different species of animals as well
  in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it 's permaculture those of you who know a little bit about this 
 such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the 
 what else does he have 
 all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take
  it 's a very elaborate and beautiful dance but i 'm going to just give you a close up on one piece of it  and that is the relationship between his cattle
 and his
 chickens his laying hens 
 and i 'll show you if you take this approach what you get ok  and this is a lot more than growing food as you 'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the 
  cartesian idea that either nature 's winning or we 're winning
 and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished 
 so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing  relatively new 
 hooked to a car battery even i could carry a quarter acre paddock set it up in fifteen minutes cows graze one day 
 they move ok they graze everything down intensive
  he waits three days and then we towed in something called the eggmobile the eggmobile is a very
 rickety contraption it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses three hundred and fifty chickens  he tows this into the paddock three days later
 and opens the gangplank
  turns them down and three hundred and fifty hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties
 and what they 're doing is very interesting they 're digging through the cow patties for the maggots 
 the grubs the larvae of flies 
 and the reason he 's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and he 'll have a huge fly problem  
 but he waits that long to grow them as big
 and juicy and tasty as he can because they are
  form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they 're pushing around the
 the manure to get at the grubs  and in the process they 're spreading the manure out 
 very useful second ecosystem service and third while they 're in this
 paddock
 they are of course defecating madly
  and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of
 just a few weeks  the grass just enters this blaze of growth 
 and within four or five weeks  he can do it again  he can graze again he can cut he can bring in another species like the lambs 
 or he can
 make hay
  i want you to just look really close up onto what 's happened there so it 's a very productive system and what i need to tell you is that on one hundred acres he gets forty thousand pounds of beef thirty thousand pounds of pork  twenty five thousand dozen eggs twenty thousand broilers one thousand turkeys one thousand rabbits
 an immense amount of food you know you hear can organic feed the world well look how much food you can produce on one hundred acres if you do this kind of
  its physiological distinctiveness  put that in play  
 but look at it from the point of view of the grass now  what happens to the grass when you do this 
 when a ruminant grazes grass 
 the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the
  and plants need to keep the the root mass
 in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy  so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots 
 they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work
 basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is
 new soil  this is how soil
  is created it 's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses
  and what i realized when i understood this and if you ask joel salatin what he is he 'll tell you he 's not a chicken farmer  he 's not a
 sheep farmer he 's not a cattle rancher  he 's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system
  is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads  
 which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature
  here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility
  and more biodiversity
 it 's a remarkably hopeful thing to do there are a lot of farmers doing this today  this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a cartesian system more or less 
 and
 what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take
  are so cheap they could be all over africa in no time that we can take the food we need from the earth and actually
 heal the earth in the process this
  a way to reanimate the world 
 and that 's what 's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin 's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than
 these ideas
 are something to be very hopeful about
