  i 'm here to talk to you about the importance of
 praise admiration and thank you and having it be specific and genuine  
 and the way i got interested in this was i noticed in myself when i was growing up and until about a few years ago that
 i would want to say thank you to someone i would want to praise them
  i would want to take in their praise of me and i 'd just stop it
  and i asked myself why 
 i felt shy i felt embarrassed  and then my question became am i the only one who does this so i decided to investigate  
 i 'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility so i get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction
  and sometimes it comes down to something as simple as their core wound is their father died without ever
 without ever saying he 's proud of them  but then they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him but he never told the son it 's because he didn 't know
 that his son needed to hear it  so my question is why don 't we ask for the things that we need
  i know a gentleman married for twenty five years who 's longing to hear his wife say thank you for being the breadwinner so i can stay home with the kids
 i know a woman who 's good at this she once a week meets with her husband and says i 'd really like you to thank me for all these things i did in the house
 and with the kids and he goes oh this is great this is great and praise really does have to be genuine  but she takes responsibility for that and a friend of mine  april who i 've had since kindergarten 
 she thanks her children for doing their chores
  why wouldn 't i thank it even though they 're supposed to do it so the question is why was i blocking it why were other people blocking it why can i say i 'll take my steak medium rare i need size six shoes 
 but i won 't say would you praise me this way and it 's because i 'm giving you critical data about me 
 i 'm telling you where i 'm insecure i 'm telling you where i need your help  
 and i 'm treating you my inner circle like you 're the enemy because what can you do with that data you could neglect me
 you could abuse it  or you could actually meet my need  and i took my bike into the bike store i love this
 same bike and they 'd do something called truing the wheels the guy said you know when you true the wheels it 's going to make the bike so much better i get the same bike back  and they 've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels i 've had for two and a half years and my bike is like new
  i 'm going to challenge all of you i want you to true your wheels be honest about the praise that you need to hear what do you need to hear go home to your wife
 go ask her what does she need go home to your husband what does he need  
 go home and ask those questions and then help the people around you and it 's simple and why should we care about this we talk about world peace how can we have world peace with different cultures different languages  
 i think it starts household by
  under the same roof  
 so let 's make it right in our own backyard and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands great mothers friends daughters sons and maybe somebody 's never said that to you but you 've done 
  a really really good job and thank you for being here just showing up and changing the world with your ideas
