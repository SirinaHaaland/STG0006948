  the truth of what i 'm going to say  i think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been
 around since before the french revolution  what 's changed is
 we now can look at the evidence we can compare societies more and less equal societies  and see what inequality does i
 'm going to take you through that data
 and then explain why the links
 i 'm going to be showing you exist  but first see what a miserable lot we are 
 i want to start though with a
  this shows you life expectancy against gross national income how rich countries are on average 
 and you see the countries on the right like norway and the usa are twice as rich as israel greece  portugal on the left  
 and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all there 's no suggestion of a relationship there  but if we look within
  there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society  this again is life expectancy these are small areas of england and wales the poorest on the right  the richest on the left
 a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top  
 so income means something very important within our societies  
 and nothing between them
  the explanation of that paradox is that within our societies we 're looking at relative income
 or social position social status
 where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us and as soon as you 've got that idea you should immediately
  what happens if we widen the differences or compress them make the income differences bigger or smaller 
 and that 's what i 'm going to show you i
 'm not using any hypothetical data i 'm taking data from the u n it 's the same as the world bank has on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies  
 the measure we 've used  because it 's easy to understand and you can download it is how much richer the top twenty percent than the bottom twenty percent in each country
  and you see in the more equal countries on the left
 japan finland norway sweden the top twenty percent are about three and a half four times as rich as the bottom twenty percent 
 but on the more unequal end u k portugal  usa singapore the differences are twice as big 
 on that measure we are twice as unequal
 as some of the other successful market democracies
  to show you what that does to our societies  
 we collected data on problems with social gradients the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder 
 internationally comparable data on life expectancy on kids ' maths and literacy scores on infant mortality rates homicide rates 
 proportion of the population in prison teenage birthrates levels of trust
 mental illness which in standard diagnostic
 classification includes drug and alcohol addiction and social mobility  
 we put them all in one index they 're all weighted equally where a country is is a sort of average score on these things 
 and there you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i 've just shown you 
 which i shall use over and over again in the data
  the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems  
 it 's an extraordinarily close correlation  
 but if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to gnp per capita gross national income 
 there 's nothing there 
 no correlation anymore
  we were a little bit worried that people might think we 'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this  this evidence  
 so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the unicef index of child well being it has forty different components put together by other people
  it contains whether
 kids can talk to their parents whether they have books at home what immunization rates are like whether there 's bullying at school  everything goes
  into it here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality  
 kids do worse in the more unequal societies  highly significant relationship  
 but once again if you look at that measure of child well being in relation to national income per person  there 's no relationship
  no suggestion of a relationship 
 what all the data i 've shown you so far says is the same thing 
 the average well being of our societies is not dependent any longer
 on national income and economic growth that 's very important in poorer countries but not in the rich developed world 
 but the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much i 'm going to show you some of the separate
  bits of our index here for instance is trust it 's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted it comes from the world values survey 
 you see at the more unequal end  
 it 's about fifteen percent of the population who feel they can trust others  
 but in the more equal societies it rises to sixty
  and if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital very similar relationships closely related to inequality 
 i may say  we did all this work twice we did it first on these rich developed countries 
 and then as a separate test bed we repeated it all on the fifty american states asking just the same question
  the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality 
 very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust same thing is going on 
 basically we found that almost anything that 's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the fifty states in that separate test bed 
  we 're not just talking about
 a fluke 
 this is mental illness who put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society  
 this is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year  
 and it goes from about eight percent
 up to three times that whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of
  others  and again closely related to inequality  this is violence these red dots are american states and the blue
 triangles are canadian provinces  but look at the scale of the differences 
 it goes from fifteen homicides per million up to one hundred and fifty 
 this is the proportion of the population in prison
  there 's a about a tenfold difference there  log scale up the side but it goes from about forty to four hundred people in prison 
 that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime 
 in some places that 's part of it but most of it is about more punitive sentencing  harsher sentencing
  and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty here we have
 children dropping out of high school  
 again quite big differences  extraordinarily damaging if you 're talking about using the talents of the population 
 this is social mobility  
 it 's actually a measure of mobility based on
  's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons or is there no relationship between the two 
 and at the more unequal end  fathers ' income is much more important
 in the u k usa  and in scandinavian countries fathers ' income is much less important there 's more social mobility  
  like to say and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here
 if americans want to live the american dream they should go to denmark 
 i 've shown you just a few things in italics here i could have shown 
 a number of other problems they 're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient  
  in more unequal countries not just a little bit worse but anything from twice as common to ten times as common 
 think of the expense  the human cost of that 
 i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points one is that in graph after graph
 we find the countries that do worse whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones 
 and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan  
 so what we 're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality it 's not just one or two things that go wrong it 's most things 
 the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that if you look at the
  different countries in all sorts of ways the position of women how closely they keep to the nuclear family  are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world 
 but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality  
 sweden has huge differences in earnings  and it narrows the gap through taxation 
  generous benefits and so on 
 japan is rather different though it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax  it has lower taxes  it has a smaller welfare state  
 and in our analysis of the american states we find rather the same contrast there are some states that do well through redistribution some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax
  so we conclude that it doesn 't much matter how you get your greater equality as long as you get there somehow i
 am not talking about perfect equality i 'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies  
 another really surprising part of this picture
 is that it 's not just the poor who are affected by inequality  there seems to be some truth in john donne 's no man is an island
 in a number of
 studies it 's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy  
 this is just one example
  it 's infant mortality  some swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the british register of general socioeconomic
  and so
 it 's anachronistically a classification by fathers ' occupations so single parents go on their own  but then where it says low social class that 's
 unskilled manual occupations it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle then the
 junior non manual going up high to the professional occupations
  directors of larger companies you see there that sweden does better than britain all the way across the social hierarchy  
 the biggest differences are at the bottom of society  but even at the top  
 there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society  
 we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally 
 and that seems to be the general picture
 that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom but has some benefits even at the top  but i should say a few words about what 's going on  
 i think i 'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality 
 more to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority of being valued and devalued respected and disrespected  
 and of course those feelings
 the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society  
 it also leads to status insecurity we worry more about how we 're judged and seen by others  whether we
 're regarded as attractive clever all that kind of thing the
  parallel work going on in social psychology  
 some people reviewed two hundred and eight different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory
 and had their stress hormones their responses to doing stressful tasks
  in the review what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise
 levels of cortisol the central stress hormone  
 and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social evaluative threat threats to self esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance  
 those kind of stresses have a very particular effect
 on the physiology of
  stress 
 now we have been criticized of course there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising 
 i should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data  we never pick and choose data we have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we 're looking at it goes into the analysis
  our data source decides whether it 's
 reliable data we don 't otherwise that would introduce bias 
 what about other countries  there are two hundred studies of health in relation to income and equality
 in the academic peer reviewed journals this isn 't confined to these countries here hiding a very simple demonstration the same
 countries the same measure of inequality one problem after another 
 why don 't we control for other factors well we 've shown you that gnp per capita doesn 't make any difference and of course others using more sophisticated methods in the literature
 have controlled for poverty and education and so on 
 what about causality
  in itself doesn 't prove prove causality  we spend a good bit of time  and indeed people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic
 health in the rich developed world
 is how important chronic stress from social sources is
 affecting the
  immune system the cardiovascular system 
 or for instance the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people
 are
 sensitive to being looked down on
 i should say that
 to deal with this we 've got to deal with the post tax things and the pre tax things we 've got to constrain income the bonus culture incomes at the top  i think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can
  i think the take home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life
 by reducing the differences in incomes between us  suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well being of whole societies  and that 's exciting
