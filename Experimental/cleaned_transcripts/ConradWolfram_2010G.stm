  we 've got a real problem with math education right now basically no one 's very happy  those learning it
 think it 's disconnected  uninteresting and hard  those trying to employ them think they don 't know enough
  governments realize that it 's a big deal for our economies but don 't know how to fix it  and teachers are also frustrated  yet math
 is more important to the world than at any point in human history 
 so at one end we 've got falling interest in education in math and at the other end we 've got a more mathematical world 
 a more quantitative world than we ever have had  
 so what 's the problem why has this
  opened up and what can we do to fix it  well actually i think the answer is staring us right in the face use computers 
 i believe that
 correctly using computers
 is the silver bullet for making math education work  
 so to explain that  let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education
 see in the real world math
 isn 't necessarily done by mathematicians  it 's done by geologists  
 engineers  biologists all sorts of different people modeling and simulation it 's actually very popular  
 but in education it looks very different dumbed down problems lots
  mostly by hand  lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world  except if you 're learning it and
 another thing about math  math sometimes looks like math like in this example here
 and sometimes it doesn 't like am i drunk 
 and then you get an answer that 's quantitative in the modern world  you wouldn 't have expected that a few years back
  but now you can find out all about unfortunately my weight is a little higher than that but
 all about what happens  so let 's zoom out a bit and ask why are we teaching people math what 's the point of teaching people math 
 and in particular why are we teaching them math in general why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject  
 well i think there are about three
  reasons technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies  what i call everyday living
 to function in the world today you 've got to be pretty quantitative much more so than a few years ago
  figure out your mortgages being skeptical of government statistics those kinds of things
 and thirdly what i would call
  like logical mind training logical thinking 
 over the years we 've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically it 's part of human society it 's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that  
 so let 's ask another question  
 what is math what do we mean when we say we 're doing math or educating people to do math well i think it 's about four steps roughly speaking
 starting with posing the right question what is it that we want to ask what is it we 're trying to find out here and this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world beyond virtually any other part of doing 
  math people ask the wrong question and surprisingly enough they get the wrong answer for that reason if not for others 
 once you 've done that then there 's the computation step turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form 
 and of course math is very powerful at doing that 
 and then finally  turn it back to the real world  did it answer the question and also verify it crucial step 
 now here 's the crazy thing right now 
 in math education we 're spending about perhaps eighty percent of the time teaching people to do
  step three by hand  
 yet that 's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice instead we ought to be using computers to do step three
 and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one two and four conceptualizing problems applying them
  getting the teacher to run them through how to do that see crucial point here 
 math is not equal to calculating 
 math is a much broader subject than calculating 
 now it 's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years there was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand  
 but in the last few decades that has totally changed we 've had the biggest transformation of any ancient
 subject that i could ever imagine with computers 
 calculating was typically the limiting step and now often it isn 't 
 so i think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating  
 but that math liberation didn 't get into education yet see i think of calculating in a sense as the machinery of math  
 it 's the chore  it 's the thing you 'd like to avoid if you can like to get a machine to do 
 it 's a means to an end not an end in itself
 and automation allows us to have that machinery computers allow us to do that
 and this is not a small problem by any means i estimated that just today across the world we spent about one hundred and six average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand 
 that 's an amazing amount of human endeavor 
 so we better be damn sure and by the way
  't even have fun doing it most of them
 so we better be damn sure
 that we know why we 're doing that and it has a real purpose
 i think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that and i think there are some cases 
 for example mental arithmetic i still do a lot
  think about it roughly it 's still quicker to do that and more practical so i think practicality is one case where it 's worth teaching people
 by hand  
 and then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating but i think they 're relatively small in number 
 one thing i often ask about is ancient greek and how this relates see the thing we 're doing right
 we 're forcing people to learn mathematics it 's a major subject 
 i 'm not for one minute suggesting that if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre they should do that that 's absolutely
 the right thing for people to follow their self interest 
 i was somewhat interested in ancient greek but i don 't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient greek  i don 't think it 's warranted  
 so i have this distinction between what we 're making people do and the
  subject that 's sort of mainstream and the subject that in a sense people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that  
 so what are the issues people bring up with this  well one of them is they say you need to get the basics first you shouldn 't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject 
 so my usual question is what do you mean by basics basics of
  are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it  or design it for that matter are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill  
 i don 't think so i think you need to separate the basics of what you 're trying to do
 from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done
 and automation allows you to make that separation a hundred years ago it 's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the
  ignition timing worked and all sorts of things 
 but automation in cars allowed that to separate so driving is now a quite separate subject so to speak from
 engineering of the car
 or learning how to service it  
 so automation allows this separation and also allows in the case of driving and i believe also in the future case of maths a democratized way of
 of doing that it can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that  
 so there 's another thing that comes up with basics people confuse in my view the order of the invention of the tools
 with the order in which they should use them for teaching so just because paper was invented before computers it doesn 't necessarily mean you get more to the basics
  using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics 
 my daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this  she enjoys making what she calls paper laptops 
 so i asked her one day you know when i was your age i didn 't make these why do you think that was and after a second or two carefully reflecting she said
  you were born after computers and paper it doesn 't really matter which order you 're taught with them in you just want to have the best tool  so another one that comes up is computers dumb math down 
 that somehow if you use a computer  it 's all mindless button pushing but if you do it by hand  it 's all intellectual 
 this one kind of
  do we really believe
 that the math that most people are doing in school practically today
 is more than applying procedures to problems they don 't really understand for reasons they don 't get 
 i don 't think so and what 's worse what they 're learning there isn 't even practically useful anymore might have been fifty years ago  
 but it isn 't anymore  when they 're out of education they do it on a computer 
 just to be clear i think computers can really help with this problem actually make it more conceptual
  of course like any great tool they can be used completely mindlessly like turning everything into a multimedia show 
 like the example i was shown of solving an equation by hand  where the computer was the teacher show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand  
 this is just nuts why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway all backwards  
 let me show you that
  can also make problems harder to calculate  see  normally in school you do things like solve quadratic equations  but
 you see  when you 're using a computer  you can just substitute  you can make it a quartic equation make it kind of harder
 same principles applied calculations
  and problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this they 've got hair all over them they 're not just simple dumbed down things that we see in school math 
 and think of the outside world do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things
 that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers i don 't think so quite the opposite  
 so the problem we 've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down
  down  but that we have dumbed down problems right now
  well another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding so if you go through lots of examples you can get
 the answer you can understand how the basics of the system work better i think there is one thing that i think very valid here
  which is that i think understanding procedures and processes is important but there 's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world it 's called programming 
 programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days and it 's also a great way
 to engage students much more
 and to check they really understand if you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it  
 so programming is the way i think we should be doing that  so to be clear what i really
  am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual simultaneously  
 i can 't think of any other subject where that 's recently been possible it 's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual  
 but i think we can do both at the same time here 
 and
 we open up so many more possibilities  you can do so many more problems what i
  really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in
 far greater quantities than they 've ever got before and experience of harder problems being able to play with the math  interact with it  feel it 
 we want people who can feel the math instinctively that 's what computers allow us to do 
 another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum traditionally it 's been by how difficult it is to calculate
  but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts however hard the calculating so calculus has traditionally been taught very late  
 why is this  well it 's damn hard doing the calculations that 's the problem  
 but actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group 
 this was an example i built for my daughter and very very simple
  we were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number and
 of course it turns into a circle and by the way she was also very insistent on being able to change the color an important feature
 for this demonstration  you can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things
  to an extreme and very small sides and a very large number of sides  very simple example that 's a view of the world that we don 't usually give people for many many years after this 
 and yet that 's a really important practical view of the world  so one of the roadblocks we have
 in moving this agenda forward
 is exams in the end if we test everyone by hand in exams  it 's kind of hard to
 to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the during the semesters
 and one of the reasons it 's so important so it 's very important to get computers in exams  
 and then we can ask questions real questions questions like what 's the best life insurance policy to get real questions that people
  have in their everyday lives and
 you see this isn 't some dumbed down model here this is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens  how many years of protection do i need what does that do to the payments
 and to the interest rates and so forth now i 'm not for one minute suggesting it 's the only kind of question that that should be asked in exams  
 but i think it 's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored
 and is critical
  got to make sure
 that we can move our economies forward 
 and also our societies  based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics  
 this isn 't some optional extra and the country that does this first will
  my view leapfrog others in achieving
 a new economy even an improved economy an improved outlook in
 fact i even talk about us moving from what we often call now the knowledge economy 
 to what we might call a computational knowledge economy where high level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is 
 we can engage so many more students with this
  and they can have a better time doing it  and let 's understand this is not
 an incremental sort of change we 're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real world math 
 and you know if you walk across a chasm you end up making it worse than if you didn 't start at all bigger disaster no
 what i 'm suggesting
 is that we should leap off we
 we should increase our velocity so it 's high  and we should leap off one side
 and go the other of course having calculated our differential equation very carefully 
 so i want to see a completely renewed  changed math curriculum built from the ground up based on computers being there computers that are now ubiquitous almost calculating 
  machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years 
 but what i am sure is it 's the mainstream subject of the future 
 let 's go for it  
 and while we 're about it  let 's have a bit of fun for us for the students and for ted here
