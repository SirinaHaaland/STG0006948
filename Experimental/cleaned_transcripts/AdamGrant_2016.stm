  seven years ago a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company he said 
 i 'm working with three friends and we 're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online 
 and i said ok you guys spent the whole
  we all took internships just in case it doesn 't work out all right but you 're going to go in full time once you graduate 
 not exactly we 've all lined up backup jobs 
 six months go by  it 's the day before the company launches  and there is still not a functioning website 
 you guys realize the entire company is a website that 's literally all it is 
 so
 i obviously declined to invest and they ended up naming the company
  parker 
 they sell glasses online  
 they were recently recognized as the world 's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars  
 and now my wife handles our investments  
 why was i so wrong to find out i 've been studying people
  originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them 
 they are people who stand out and speak up originals drive creativity and change in the world  they 're the people you want to bet on 
 and they look nothing like i expected 
 i want to show you today three things i 've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them 
 so the first reason that i passed on
 warby parker was they were really slow getting off the ground  now  you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator  
 well i have a confession for you i 'm the opposite  i 'm a 
 yes that 's an actual term you know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven 't done anything yet  
 i just feel that a few months ahead of time
 so this started early when i was a kid  i took nintendo games very seriously  
 i would wake up at 5am start playing and not stop until i had mastered them 
 eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of
  since then i have traded hair for teeth 
 but this served me well in college because i finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline  
 and i was proud of that
  until a few years ago  i had a student named jihae who came to me
 and said i have my most creative ideas when i 'm procrastinating and i was like that 's cute where are the four papers you owe me 
 no she was one of our most creative students and as an organizational psychologist this is the kind of idea that i test  
 so i challenged her to get some data  she goes into a bunch of companies she has people fill out
  surveys about how often they procrastinate then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are  
 and sure enough the precrastinators like me who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately  
 so i want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators  she was like
  are our results 
 you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don 't have any new ideas 
 and on the flip side the people who race in
 are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don 't have original thoughts either there 's a sweet
 sweet spot where originals seem to live  
 why is this  maybe original people just have bad work habits  maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity 
 to find out 
 we designed some experiments  we asked people to generate new business ideas and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are 
 and some of them are asked to do the task right away others we randomly assign to procrastinate
 by dangling
  minesweeper in front of them
 for either five or ten minutes  
 and sure enough  the moderate procrastinators are sixteen percent more creative than the other two groups 
 now minesweeper is awesome but it 's not the driver of the effect  because if you play the game first before you learn about the task there 's no creativity boost it
 's only when you 're told that you 're going to be working on this problem  and then you start procrastinating but the task
  is still active in the back of your mind 
 that you start to incubate procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas to think in nonlinear ways to make unexpected leaps  
 so just as we were finishing these experiments i was starting to write a book about originals and i thought this is the perfect time to teach myself to
  i woke up early the next morning and i made a to do list with steps on how to procrastinate 
 laughter and then i worked diligently
 toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal i started writing the procrastination chapter and one day i
  was halfway through i literally put it away in  mid sentence for months it was agony  
 but when i came back to it i had all sorts of new ideas 
 as aaron sorkin put it you call it procrastinating  i call it thinking 
 and along the way i discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators  take leonardo da vinci he
  toiled on and off for sixteen years on the mona lisa he felt like a failure he wrote as much in his journal  
 but some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light
 and made him into a much better painter  what about martin luther king jr the night before the biggest speech of his life the march on washington  he was up past
 rewriting it he 's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage  and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines 
 when he gets onstage  eleven minutes in he leaves his prepared remarks
 to utter four words that changed the course of history i have a dream that was not in the script 
 by delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the
  very last minute  
 he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas and because the text wasn 't set in stone  he had freedom to improvise 
 procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity  but it can be a virtue for creativity  
 what you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they 're slow to finish and this is what i missed with
 when they were dragging their heels for six months i looked at them and said you know a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online 
 they missed the first mover advantage  
 but what i didn 't realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online  
 and it turns out the first mover advantage is mostly a myth 
 look at a classic study of over fifty product categories
  comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better 
 what you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of forty seven percent compared with only eight percent
 for the improvers look at facebook waiting to build a social network until after myspace
 and friendster look at google waiting for years after altavista and yahoo
  's much easier
 to improve on somebody else 's idea than it is to create something new from scratch 
 so the lesson i learned is that to be original you don 't have to be first you just have to be different and better 
 but that wasn 't the only reason i passed on warby parker  they were also full of doubts they had backup plans
  and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original because i expected that
 originals would look something like this 
 now on the surface a lot of original people look confident but behind the scenes they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do 
 they just manage it differently  
 let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us
 laughter now in my research i discovered there are two different kinds of doubt there 's self doubt and idea
 doubt self doubt is paralyzing  
 it leads you to freeze  but idea doubt is energizing it motivates you to test to experiment to refine just like mlk did 
 and so the key to being original
 is just a simple thing
 of avoiding the leap from step three to step four instead of saying i 'm crap you say the first few drafts are always crap  
 and i 'm just not there yet 
 so how do you get there well there 's a clue it turns out in the internet browser that you use we can predict your job performance and your commitment just by
  knowing what web browser you use  now some of you are not going to like the results of this study 
 but there is good evidence that firefox and chrome users significantly outperform internet explorer and safari users 
 they also stay in their jobs fifteen percent longer by the way  why it 's not a technical advantage
  the four browser groups on average have similar typing speed
 and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge it 's about how you got the browser 
 because if you use internet explorer or safari those came preinstalled on your computer and you accepted the default option that was handed to you 
 if you wanted firefox or chrome you had to doubt the default and ask is there a different option out there  and then be a little resourceful and download a
  so people hear about this study and they 're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser 
 no  it 's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option 
 and if you do that well  you will open yourself up to the opposite of dj vu 
 there 's a name for it it 's called vuja de laughter
  de is when you look at something you 've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes  
 it 's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can 't get the green light for more than half a century 
 in every past version  the main character has been an evil queen  
 but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense she rewrites the first act reinvents the villain as a tortured hero
 and frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever
  so there 's a simple message from this story when you feel doubt don 't let it go 
 what about fear originals feel fear too 
 they 're afraid of failing  but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they 're even more afraid of failing to try  
 they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
 they know that in the long run our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions  
 the things we wish we could redo if you look at the science are the chances not taken  
 elon musk told me recently he didn 't expect tesla to succeed  he was sure the first few spacex launches would fail to make it to orbit let alone
  but it was too important not to try  and for so many of us when we have an important idea we don 't bother to try  
 but i have some good news for you 
 you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas a lot of people think they will if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion
 eighty five percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up 
  they were afraid of embarrassing themselves of looking stupid  but guess what originals have lots and lots of bad ideas  tons of them in fact  
 take the guy who invented this do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults 
 you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb 
 if you look across fields  the greatest originals are the ones
  who fail the most because they 're the ones who try the most  take classical composers the best of the best  why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others
 and also have their compositions rerecorded more times one of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate  
 the more output you churn out the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original
  even the three icons of classical music bach  beethoven mozart
 had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions
 to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces  
 now  you may be wondering how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot  i don 't know how wagner pulled that off  
 but for most of us  if we want to be more original we have to generate more
  ideas 
 the  warby parker founders  when they were trying to name their company  
 they needed something sophisticated unique with no negative associations to build a retail brand  
 and they tested over two thousand possibilities before they finally put together warby and parker  
 so if you put all this together what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us  they feel fear and doubt
  procrastinate  they have bad ideas and sometimes it 's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed  
 so when you see those things don 't make the same mistake i did don 't write them off and when that 's you don 't count yourself out either 
 know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity 
 that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try
  need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones 
 look being original is not easy  but i have no doubt about this  it 's the best way to improve the world around us
