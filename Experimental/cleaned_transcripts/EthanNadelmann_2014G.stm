  the war on drugs done to the world 
 look at the murder and mayhem in mexico central america  so many other parts of the planet the
 global black market estimated at three hundred billion dollars a year  prisons packed in the united states and elsewhere
 police and military drawn into an unwinnable war that
 violates basic rights and ordinary citizens just hope they don 't get caught in the crossfire  
 and meanwhile more people using more drugs than ever it 's my country 's history with alcohol prohibition and al capone  times fifty 
 which is why it 's particularly galling to me as an american that
  we 've been the driving force behind this global drug war ask why so many countries criminalize drugs they 'd never heard of 
 why the u n drug treaties emphasize criminalization over health 
 even why most of the money worldwide for dealing with drug abuse goes not to helping agencies but those that punish and you 'll find
  why did we do this 
 some people especially in latin america think it 's not really about drugs  it 's just a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the u s 
 but by and large  that 's not it 
 we don 't want gangsters and guerrillas funded with illegal drug money terrorizing and taking
  the fact is america really is crazy when it comes to drugs i mean don 't forget we 're the ones who thought that we could prohibit alcohol  so think about our global drug war not as any sort of rational policy 
 but as the international projection of a domestic psychosis 
 but here 's the good news now it 's the russians leading the drug war
 not us most politicians in my country want to roll back the drug war now put fewer people behind bars  not more and i 'm proud to say as an american that we 
  now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies  it 's now legal for medical purposes in almost half our fifty states  millions of people can purchase their marijuana their medicine
  licensed dispensaries and over half my fellow citizens now say it 's time to legally regulate and tax marijuana more or less like alcohol that 's what colorado and washington are doing and uruguay  and others are sure to follow
  so that 's what i do work to end the drug war 
 i think it all started growing up in a fairly religious moral family  eldest son of a rabbi going off to
  university where i smoked some marijuana
 and i liked it laughter
 and i liked drinking too but it was obvious that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two  but my friends and i could get busted for smoking a joint now that hypocrisy kept bugging me  so i wrote my ph d dissertation on international
  i talked my way into the state department i got a security clearance i interviewed hundreds of dea and other law enforcement agents all around europe and the americas and i 'd ask them what do you 
  think the answer is well in latin america they 'd say to me you can 't really cut off the supply  the answer lies back in the u s in cutting off the demand 
  you can 't really cut off the demand the answer lies over there you 've got to cut off the supply 
 then i 'd go and talk to the guys in customs trying to stop drugs at the borders  and they 'd say you 're not going to stop it here  the answer lies over there in cutting off supply and demand 
 and it hit me  
 everybody involved in this thought the answer lay in that area about which they knew the
 so that 's when i started reading everything i could about psychoactive drugs the history the science the politics all of it and the more one read the 
  more it hit you how a thoughtful enlightened intelligent approach took you over here  whereas the politics and laws of my country were taking you
  struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle  there 's probably never been
 a drug free society  
 virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain increase our energy socialize even commune with
  our desire to alter our consciousness may be as fundamental as our desires for food companionship and sex 
 so our true challenge
 is to learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible harm and in some cases the greatest possible benefit i
 'll tell you something else i learned that the reason some drugs are legal and others not has almost nothing to do with science or health
  or or the relative risk of drugs and almost everything to do with who uses and who is perceived to use particular drugs  in the late  19th century
  when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal the principal consumers of opiates in my country and others were 
 white women  using them to alleviate aches and pains when few other analgesics were available and nobody
  thought about criminalizing it back then because nobody wanted to put grandma behind bars  
 but when hundreds of thousands of chinese started showing up in my country  working hard on the railroads and the mines and then kicking back in the evening just like they had in the old country with
 a few puffs on that opium pipe 
 that 's when you saw the first drug prohibition laws in california and nevada  driven by racist fears of chinese transforming white women
  into opium addicted sex slaves  
 the first cocaine prohibition laws similarly prompted by racist fears of black men sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in southern society 
  and the first marijuana prohibition laws all about fears of mexican migrants
  in so many others as well with both the origins of these laws and their implementation 
 put it this way  and i exaggerate only slightly  
 if the principal smokers of cocaine were affluent older white men and the principal consumers of viagra
  cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor and selling viagra would get you five to ten years behind bars 
 i used to be a professor teaching about this now i 'm an activist a human rights activist and what drives 
  me is my shame at living in an otherwise great nation that has less than five percent of the world 's population but almost twenty five percent of the world 's incarcerated
  population it 's the people i meet who have lost someone they love to  drug related violence or prison or overdose or aids because our drug policies emphasize criminalization 
 over health it 's good people who have lost their their jobs their homes their freedom  even their children to the state not because they hurt anyone but solely because they chose to use one drug
  instead of another 
 so is legalization the answer 
 on that i 'm torn  three days a week i think yes three days a week i think no  and on sundays i 'm agnostic
 but since today is tuesday let me just say that
  legally regulating and taxing most of the drugs that are now criminalized would radically reduce the crime violence corruption and black markets and the problems of adulterated 
  and unregulated drugs and improve public safety and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes
  sugar  and so many other things where there is a demand there will be a supply  
 knock out one source and another inevitably emerges people tend to think of prohibition
 as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents the abdication of regulation
 with criminals filling the void  
 which is why putting criminal laws and police front and center in trying to control a dynamic global commodities market is a recipe for disaster  
 and what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground
 and regulate them as intelligently
  as we can
 to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies 
 now with marijuana that obviously means legally regulating and taxing it like alcohol
  the benefits of doing so are enormous the risks minimal will more people use marijuana maybe  
 but it 's not going to be young people because it 's not going to be legalized for them and quite frankly they already have the best access to marijuana
  i think it 's going to be older people it 's going to be people in their 40s and 
  and 80s
 who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a long term marriage 
 and that just might be a net public health benefit as for the other
  drugs  look at portugal where nobody goes to jail for possessing drugs and the government 's made a serious commitment to treating addiction as a health issue look at switzerland 
  germany the netherlands denmark  england where people who have been addicted to heroin for many years and repeatedly tried to quit and failed can get pharmaceutical heroin and helping services 
 in medical clinics and the results are in illegal drug abuse
 and disease and and overdoses and crime and arrests all go down 
 health and well being improve taxpayers benefit and many drug users even put their addictions behind them 
 look at new zealand  which recently enacted a law allowing certain recreational drugs to be sold legally provided their
  can be legally bought and consumed provided it 's done so within a religious context  
 look in bolivia and peru  where all sorts of products made from the coca leaf the source of cocaine are sold legally over the counter with no apparent harm to people 's public health
  and so far as we know was no more addictive than coca cola is today conversely think about cigarettes  nothing
 can both hook you and kill you like cigarettes when
 researchers ask heroin addicts what 's the toughest drug to quit most say cigarettes  yet in my country and many others 
 half of all the people who were ever addicted
  to cigarettes have quit without anyone being arrested or put in jail or sent to a treatment program by a prosecutor or a judge what did it were
  were higher taxes and time and place restrictions on sale and use and effective anti smoking campaigns 
 probably  but just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result  
 so the challenges we face today are twofold  the first is the policy challenge
 of designing and implementing
 alternatives to ineffective
 prohibitionist policies even as we need to get better at regulating and living with the drugs that are now legal 
 but the second challenge is tougher 
 because it 's about us  
 the obstacles to reform lie not just out there in the power of the prison industrial complex or other vested interests that want to keep things the way they are but within each and every one of us 
 it 's our
  fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands in the way of real reform 
 and ultimately  i think that boils down to the kids  
 and to every parent 's desire to put our baby in a bubble and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk in fact sometimes it seems like the entire
 war on drugs gets justified as one great big child protection act which any young person can tell you it 's not 
 so
 here 's what i say to teenagers first don 't do drugs  second don 't do
  if you do do drugs  there 's some things i want you to know because my bottom line as your parent is come home safely 
  at the end of the night and grow up and lead a healthy and good adulthood that 's my drug education mantra  safety first  
  people who believe we need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug policies grounded in science  compassion health and human 
  rights  where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well where people who love our drugs  people who hate drugs and people who don 't give a damn about drugs
  every one of us believes that this war on drugs this backward  heartless disastrous war on drugs  has got to
  congrats quite the reaction that was a powerful talk 
 not quite a complete standing o though
  and i 'm guessing that some people here and maybe a few watching online maybe someone
 knows a teenager or a friend or whatever who got sick maybe died from some drug overdose  i 'm sure you
  had these people approach you before what do you say to them ethan nadelmann chris the most amazing thing that 's happened of late
 is that i 've met a growing number of people who have actually lost a sibling or a child to a drug overdose  and ten years ago those people just wanted to say let 's line up all the drug dealers and shoot them and that will solve it  
 and what they 've come to understand is that the drug war did nothing to protect their kids if anything it made it more likely that those kids were put at risk
 and so they 're now becoming part of this drug policy reform movement 
 there 's other people who have kids one 's addicted to alcohol the other one 's addicted to cocaine or heroin and they ask themselves the question why does this kid get to take one step at a time and try to get better 
 and that one 's got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time so everybody 's understanding the drug war 's not
  certainly in the u s you 've got political gridlock on most issues is there any realistic chance of anything actually shifting on this issue in the next five years en i 'd say it 's quite remarkable i 'm getting 
  all these calls from journalists now who are saying to me ethan it seems like the only two issues advancing politically in america right now are marijuana law reform and gay marriage  
  to be enacted with majority democratic support so we 've gone from being sort of the third rail the most fearful issue of american politics to becoming one of the most successful
