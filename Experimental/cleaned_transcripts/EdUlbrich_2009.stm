  i 'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers
 that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years 
 and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization  so i want to show you a clip of the film now hopefully it won 't stutter
  and if we did our jobs well  you won 't know that we were even involved
  there were many changes some you could
 some you couldn 't hair started growing in all sorts of places along with other things  
 i felt pretty good considering ed ulbrich 
 that was a clip from the curious case of benjamin button many of you  maybe you 've seen it or you 've heard of the story
  but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film the main character benjamin button who 's played by brad pitt is completely computer generated from the neck up 
 now  there 's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor 's body  we 've created a completely digital human head 
 so i 'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project this is based on an f scott fitzgerald short story
 it 's about a man who 's born old and lives his life in reverse now this movie has floated around hollywood for
 well over half a century and we first got involved with the project in the early ' 90s with ron howard as the director we took a lot of meetings and
 we seriously considered it but at the time we had to throw in the towel  
 it was deemed impossible it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards backwards 
 the human form in particular the human head has been considered the holy grail of our industry
  came back to us about a decade later and this time with a director named david fincher now  fincher is is an interesting guy 
 david is fearless of technology and he is absolutely tenacious  and david won 't take no and david believed like we do
 in the visual effects industry  that anything is possible as long as you have enough
  resources and of course money 
 and so david had an interesting take on the film  and he threw a challenge at us he wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor  it happened to be this guy  
 we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery
 with david and we ruled out of course swapping actors that was one idea that we would have different actors and we would hand off from actor to actor we even ruled out the idea of using makeup we realized that prosthetic
  makeup just wouldn 't hold up  
 particularly in close up and makeup is an additive process you have to build the face up and david wanted to carve deeply into brad 's face to bring the aging to this character  
 he needed to be a very sympathetic character
  so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a
  's head aged to appear as benjamin and attach that to the body of the real actor  
 sounded great of course  this was the holy grail of our our industry  and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn 't help
 either because i 'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store  you know we see his face constantly so there really was no tolerable
  margin of error
 there were two studios involved  warner brothers and paramount  and they both believed this would make an amazing film of course but it was a very high risk proposition there was lots of money and reputations at stake
  but we believed that we had a very solid methodology that
 might work  but despite our verbal assurances they wanted some proof
 and so in two thousand and four they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin  and we did it in about five
  weeks  
 but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts we basically put something together to get through the meeting i 'll roll that for you now this was the first test for benjamin button  and in here you can see that 's a computer generated head
 pretty good attached to the body of an actor  and it worked  and it gave the studio
 great relief after many years of starts and stops on this project and making that tough decision they
  finally decided to greenlight the movie and i can remember actually when i got the phone call to congratulate us to say the movie was a go i actually threw up you
 this is some tough stuff  so we started to have early team meetings and we got everybody together and it was really more like therapy in the beginning 
  convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character and it 's not a special effects film it has to be a man
  we really felt like we were in a kind of a 12 step program  and of course the first step is admit you 've got a problem 
 so
 we had a big problem we didn 't know how we were going to do this  but we did know one thing
 being from the visual effects industry we with david believed that we now had enough time enough resources and god we hoped we had enough money
  and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence  so  when you 're faced with something like that of course you 've got to break it down you take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that so we had three main areas that we had to focus on 
 we needed to make brad look a lot older needed to age
  and we also needed to make sure that we could take brad
 's
 idiosyncrasies his little tics the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen  and we also needed to create
 a character that could hold up under really all conditions  he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at nighttime under candlelight he had to hold an extreme close up he had to deliver dialogue he had to be able to run he had to be able to sweat he had to be able to take a bath to cry
  he even had to throw up not all at the same time but he had to you know 
 do all of those things  and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we did about three hundred and twenty five shots  so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do  
 and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in two thousand and four and where we needed it to be
 we focused on motion capture  i 'm sure many of you have seen motion capture  the state of the art at the time was something called marker based motion capture i 'll give you an example here it 's basically the idea of you wear a leotard 
 and they put some reflective markers on your body  and instead of using cameras there 're infrared sensors around a volume  and those infrared sensors track the
  in real time and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character you can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the
 as the dancers but we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that 's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process and as you can see it gives you a
 pretty crappy performance that
 's not terribly compelling  and what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers we needed the the subtleties of the skin we needed to see skin moving 
  over muscle moving over bone we needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo 
  the state of the art  so we aborted using motion capture  and we were now well out of our comfort zone  and in uncharted territory
  we were left with this idea that we ended up calling 
 technology stew we started to look out in other fields  the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that
 come from other industries like medical imaging the video game space  and re appropriate them  and
 we had to create kind of a sauce and the sauce was
 code in software that we 'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come
  together and and work as one   initially we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named dr paul ekman in the early ' 70s he believed
 that he could in fact catalog the human face and he came up with this idea of facial action coding system or facs he believed that there were seventy basic poses or shapes of the
  those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing  and of course
  these transcend age race culture gender  so this became the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour 
  and here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face and now what we 're looking at is really
  of a computer array of cameras  and those cameras can
 frame by frame reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject 's doing at the moment so effectively you get
 3d data in real time of the subject  and if you look in a comparison on the left we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us so clearly 
 we were in a substantially better place for this but these were the early days of this technology
  proven yet  we measure
 complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count  and so
  on the left we were seeing one hundred thousand polygons we could go up into the millions of polygons it seemed to be infinite this was when we had our aha this was the breakthrough this is when we 're like ok we 're going to be ok this is actually going to work 
 and
  what if we could take brad pitt  and we could put brad
 in this device
  and use this contour process and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights  and we could in fact scan him in real time performing ekman 's facs poses 
 right so  effectively we ended up with a 3d database of everything brad pitt 's face is capable of doing 
 from there we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face so we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes 
  a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of of doing now  that 's great except we had him at age forty four we need to put another forty years on him at this point we 
  brought in rick baker  and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry  and we also brought in a gentleman named kazu tsuji and kazu tsuji is one of the great
 sculptors of our time  and we commissioned them to make a
 a maquette or a bust of benjamin  so in the spirit of the great unveiling i had to do this i had to unveil something  so this is ben eighty
 we created three of these there 's ben eighty there 's ben seventy there 's ben sixty  and this really became
  this was made from a life cast of brad so in fact
  anatomically it is correct the eyes the jaw the teeth everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has we have these maquettes scanned into the computer at at very high resolution enormous polygonal count
  and so now we had
 three age increments of benjamin in the computer  but we needed to get
 a database of him doing more than that we went through this process then called retargeting
  this is brad doing one of the ekman facs poses and here 's the resulting data that comes from that the model that comes from that retargeting is the process of transposing that data 
 onto another model and because the life cast or the bust the maquette of benjamin was made from brad we could transpose the data
  everything brad pitt 's face can do at age eighty seven in his 70s and in his 60s next we had to go into the shooting process so while all that 's going on we 're down in new orleans and locations around the 
  world and we shot our body actors and we shot them wearing blue hoods so these are the gentleman who played benjamin 
  now we needed to get brad 's performance to drive our virtual benjamin  and so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the the rest of the cast and
 the body actors
 and about six months later we brought brad onto a sound stage in los angeles
 and he watched on the screen
 his job then was to become benjamin  and so we looped the scenes he watched again and again we encouraged him to improvise  and he took
  benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn 't think he was going to go 
 we shot him with four hd cameras so we 'd get multiple views of him and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast
 from there we went into a process called image analysis  and so here you can see again  the chosen take  and you are seeing now that data being transposed on to ben
  about this is we used something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjamin 's face and so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well in frame fourteen 
  the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here and it concludes moving in frame thirty two and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from and then the sauce i talked about with our technology stew that secret sauce
  to match the performance footage of brad in live action
 with our database of aged benjamin the facs shapes that we had on a frame by frame basis we could actually reconstruct
 a 3d head that exactly matched the performance of brad  so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film  
 and here you can see the body actor  and then this is what we called the dead head no reference to jerry garcia
  and
 then here 's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance and then again  the final shot it
 was a long process 
  next section here  i 'm going to just blast through this because we could do a whole tedtalk on the next
 several slides  we had to create a lighting system so really a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that
 benjamin had to appear so that
 we could put ben 's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that 's on the other actors in the real world  we also had to create an eye system  we found
  the eyes are the window to the soul absolutely true so the key here was to keep everybody looking in ben 's eyes  and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel his intent coming through the 
  eyes then we would succeed so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years we also had to create a mouth system  we worked from dental molds of brad we had to age the teeth over time we also had to create an articulating tongue
  that allowed him to enunciate his words there was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue we had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months he was very popular 
 skin displacement another big deal the skin had to be absolutely accurate he 's also in an old age home he 's in a nursing home around other old people so he had to look exactly the same as the others  
 so  lots of work on skin deformation you can see in some of these cases it works in some cases it looks bad this is a very very very early test in
  effectively we created a digital puppet that brad pitt could operate with his own face  there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior
 or
 enhance his performance  there was something that we encountered though that we ended up calling the digital botox effect so  as things went through this process  
 fincher would always say it sandblasts the edges off of the performance
 intent the intent of the actor  so it sees a smile as a smile it doesn 't recognize an ironic smile or a
 happy smile or a frustrated smile so it did take humans to kind of push it
 one way or another but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture as opposed to just motion capture take another look
