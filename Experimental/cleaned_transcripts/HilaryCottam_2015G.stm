  i want to tell you three stories
 about the power of relationships to solve the deep and complex social problems of this century you know  sometimes it seems like all these problems of
  ill health unemployment violence addiction they 're right there in one person 's life  so i want to tell you about someone like this that i know
 i 'm going to call her ella 
 ella lives in a british city on a run down estate  
 the shops are closed the pub 's gone the playground 's pretty desolate and never used and inside ella 's house the tension is palpable and the
  noise levels are deafening the tv 's on at full volume one of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters another son ryan is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen and the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining 
 ella is stuck she has lived with crisis for forty years she knows nothing else and she knows no way out 
 she 's had a whole series of abusive partners and  
  one of her children has been taken into care by social services the three children that still live with her
 suffer from a whole range of problems and none of them are in education  and ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle of her own mother 's life before her 
 but when i met ella there were seventy three different services on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives 
 seventy three different services run out of twenty four departments in one city 
 and ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them they think nothing of calling social services
  and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out 
 and the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers  youth workers a health officer a housing officer a home tutor
 and the local policemen and the governments say that there are one hundred thousand families in britain today like ella 's  struggling to break the cycle
  social and environmental
 deprivation 
 and they also say that managing this problem costs a quarter of a million pounds per family per year and yet nothing changes  none of these well meaning visitors are making a difference 
 this is a chart we made in the same city with another family
 like ella 's  this shows thirty years of intervention in that family 's life 
 and just as with ella not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan there 's no end goal in sight none of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues
  these are just containment measures ways of managing a problem
 one of the policemen says to me look i just deliver the message and then i leave 
 so i 've spent time living with families like ella 's in different parts of the world because i want to know what can we learn from places where our social institutions just aren 't working 
 i want to know what it feels like to live in ella 's family i want to know what 's going on and what we can do differently
  first thing i learned is that cost is a really slippery concept 
 because when the government says that a family like ella 's costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage what it really means is that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year 
 because not one penny of this money actually touches ella 's family in a way that makes a difference  
 instead the system is just like this costly gyroscope that spins around the families keeping them stuck at its heart exactly where they are
 and i also spent time with the frontline workers  and i learned that it is an impossible situation  so tom who is the social worker for
 ella 's 14 year old son ryan has to spend eighty six percent of his time servicing the system  
 meetings with colleagues filling out forms more meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms and maybe most shockingly the fourteen
  time he has to be with ryan is spent getting data and information for the system so he says to ryan 
 how often have you been smoking have you been drinking when did you go to school 
 and this kind of interaction rules out the possibility of a normal conversation  it rules out the possibility of what 's needed to build a relationship between tom and ryan 
 when we made this chart the frontline workers the professionals they stared at it absolutely amazed it snaked around the walls of their offices  so many hours
  well meant  but ultimately so futile  and there was this moment of absolute breakdown 
 and then of clarity we had to work in a different way 
 so in a really brave step the leaders of the city where ella lives agreed that we could start by reversing ryan 's ratio so
 everyone who came into contact with ella or a family like ella 's would spend eighty percent of their time working with the families and
  only twenty percent servicing the system and even more radically the families would lead and they would decide who was in a best position to help them  
 so ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel to choose from amongst the existing professionals who would work with them 
 and many many people wanted to join us because you don 't go into this kind of work to manage a system you go in because you can and you want to make a difference
  and the mother asked everybody who came through the door what will you do when my son starts kicking me and so the first person who comes in says well
 i 'll look around for the nearest exit and i will back out very slowly  and if the noise is still going on i 'll call my supervisor and the mothers go you 're the system get out of here 
 and then the next person who comes is a policeman
  tackle your son to the ground and then i 'm not sure what i 'll do and the mothers say thank you 
 so they chose professionals who confessed they didn 't necessarily have the answers who said 
 well they weren 't going to talk in jargon they showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin even though they wouldn 't be soft with them 
 so these new teams and the families were then given a
 sliver of the former budget but they could spend the money in any way they chose  
 and so one of the families went out for supper they went to mcdonald 's and they sat down and they talked and they listened for the first time in a long time another family asked the
 team if they would help them
 do up their home and one mother took the money and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise  
 and in a really short space of time something new started to grow a relationship between the team and the workers
  and then some remarkable changes took place
 maybe it 's not surprising that the journey for ella has had some big steps backwards as well as forwards  but today 
 she 's completed an it training course she has her first paid job her children are back in school  
 and the neighbors who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere except next door to them 
  are fine they 've made some new friendships and all the same people have been involved in this transformation
 same families same workers  but the relationship between them has been supported to change  
 so i 'm telling you about ella because i think that relationships are the critical resource we have in solving some of these intractable problems  
 but today our relationships are all but written off by our
  our social policies our welfare institutions and i 've learned that this really has to change 
 so what do i mean by relationships 
 i 'm talking about the simple human bonds between us a kind of authentic sense of connection of belonging the bonds that make us happy that support us to change to be brave like ella and try something new 
 and you know it 's no accident that those who run and work in the institutions
  supposed to support ella and her family don 't talk about relationships 
 because relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model that was drawn up in britain and exported around the world  
 the contemporaries of william beveridge who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the beveridge report had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man instead 
 they trusted this idea of the impersonal system and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system 
  beveridge
 on the way the modern state sees social issues just can 't be underestimated  
 the beveridge report sold over one hundred thousand copies in the first weeks of publication alone 
 people queued in the rain on a november night to get hold of a copy and it was read across the country across the colonies across europe across the united states of america  
 and it had this huge impact on the way that welfare states were designed around the globe
  cultures the bureaucracies the institutions
 they are global and they 've come to seem like common sense they 've become so ingrained in us that actually we don 't even see them anymore  
 and i think it 's really important to say that in the 20th century they were remarkably successful these institutions they led to longer lifespans the eradication of mass disease mass housing almost universal education
  but at the same time beveridge sowed the seeds of today 's challenges  
 so let me tell you a second story  what do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking  
 it 's loneliness  according to government statistics one person
  over sixty one in three
 doesn 't speak to or see another person in a week 
 one person in ten that 's eight hundred and fifty thousand people doesn 't speak to anyone else in a month  
 and we 're not the only people with this problem this problem touches the whole of the western world  and it 's even more acute in countries like china where a process of rapid urbanization mass migration has left older people alone in the villages  
 and so the services that beveridge designed and exported they can 't address
  this kind of problem loneliness is like a collective relational challenge  and it can 't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response 
 so some years ago wanting to understand this problem  i started to work with a group of about sixty older people in south london where i live 
 i went shopping i played bingo  but mainly i was just observing and
  to know what we could do differently  
 and if you ask them people tell you they want two things 
 they want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb or to be there when they come out of hospital they want on demand practical support 
 and they want to have fun  they want to go out do interesting things with like minded people and make friends like we 've all made friends at every stage of our lives  
 so we rented a phone
  hired a couple of handymen and started a service we called circle 
 and circle offers its local membership a toll free zero eight hundred number that they can call on demand for any support 
 and people have called us for so many reasons they 've called because their pets are unwell their dvd is broken they 've forgotten how to use their mobile phone or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there 
 and circle also offers a rich social calendar
 knitting
  museum tours hot air ballooning you name it 
 but here 's the interesting thing the really deep change  
 over time  the friendships that have formed have begun to replace the practical offer  
 so let me tell you about belinda belinda 's a circle member  
 and she was going into hospital for a hip operation so she called her local circle to say they wouldn 't see her for a bit 
 and damon who runs the local circle calls her back and says how can i help
 jocelyn is doing the shopping tony 's doing the gardening melissa and joe are going to come in and cook and chat 
 so five circle members had organized themselves to take care of belinda  
 and belinda 's eighty  although she says that she feels twenty five inside but she also says that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined circle
  but the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event
 led to a process where natural friendships formed friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services 
 it 's relationships that are making the difference  
 so i think that three factors have converged that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center of how we solve social problems
  the nature of the problems they 've changed and they require different solutions  secondly the cost human as much as financial of doing business as usual 
 and thirdly technology 
 i 've talked about the first two factors 
 it 's technology that enables these approaches to scale and potentially now support thousands of people 
 so the technology we 've used is really simple it 's made up of available things like databases mobile phones circle has got this very simple system that underpins it
  enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand 
 and you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization of the 1970s when this kind of scale just wasn 't possible neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide  
 so it 's relationships underpinned by technology that can turn the beveridge models on their heads  
 the beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources
  managing access in my work at the front line i 've seen again and again how
 up to eighty percent of resource is spent keeping people out so professionals have to administer these increasingly complex forms of administration that are basically about stopping people accessing the service
 or managing the queue  and circle like the relational services that we and others have designed inverts this logic what it
  says is the more people the more relationships the stronger the solution  
 so i want to tell you my third and final story which is about unemployment 
 in britain as in most places in the world  our welfare states were primarily designed to
 get people into work to educate them for this and to keep them healthy  but here
  systems are failing 
 and so the response has been to try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional to speed up processing times divide people into ever smaller categories try and target services at them more efficiently
 in other words  the very opposite of relational 
 but guess how most people find work today
  through word of mouth  
 it turns out that in britain today most new jobs are not advertised  
 so it 's friends that tell you about a job  it 's friends that recommend you for a job  and it 's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work
 maybe some of you here this evening are thinking but i found my job through an advert but if you think back it was probably a friend that showed you the ad and then encouraged you to apply  
 but not surprisingly people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network
 are those who are most isolated from it 
 so knowing this and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems we designed something new with relationships at its heart we designed
 a service that encourages people to meet up people in and out of work to work together in structured ways and try new
  it 's very hard to compare the results of these new systems with the old transactional models but it looks like with our first one thousand members we outperformed existing services by a factor of three at a fraction of the cost 
 and here too we 've used technology  
 but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do we 've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other building real relationships and supporting people to find work
  at the end of his life in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight beveridge wrote a third report  and in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake 
 he had left people and their communities
 out and this omission he said led 
 to seeing people and people starting to see themselves within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions
  and human relationships were already withering  
 but unfortunately this third report was much less read than beveridge 's earlier work  
 but today  
 we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services in an approach that i call relational
  we need to leave behind these old transactional unsuitable outdated models 
 and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like ella 's 
 that can address an issue like loneliness that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market that can also address challenges of education of health care 
  systems and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies
