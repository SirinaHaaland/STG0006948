  you to put off your preconceptions your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles because
 that is the only way i 'm going to get my story across to you and by the way if i come across as a sort of rabid hippie conservationist  it 's purely a figment of your
  imagination 
 okay we are actually the first species on earth to
 be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival  
 and i know we 've all seen images enough to make us numb of the tragedies that we 're perpetrating on the planet 
 we 're kind of like greedy kids using it all up
  and today is a time for me to talk to you about water  it 's not only because we like to drink lots of it 
 and its marvelous derivatives beer wine etc  
 and of course watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers  
 but for several other reasons as well  when i was a kid growing up in new york i was smitten by snakes the same way most kids are
 tops marbles  cars trains  cricket balls 
 and my mother  
 brave lady was partly to blame taking me to the new york natural history museum  buying me books on snakes and then starting this infamous career of mine 
 which
 has culminated in of course  arriving in india sixty years ago brought by my mother doris norden and my stepfather
  rama chattopadhyaya  it 's been a roller coaster ride 
 two animals two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on 
 one of them was the remarkable gharial this crocodile which grows to almost twenty feet long
 in the northern rivers  and this charismatic snake the king cobra  what my purpose of the talk today really is is to sort
  indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures  because
 this is what you will take away from here a reconnection with nature i hope  
 the king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons 
 what you 're seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest nearby here of a female king cobra making her nest here is a limbless animal
  of gathering a huge mound of leaves  and then laying her eggs inside to withstand five to ten [ meters of rainfall ] 
 in order that the eggs can incubate over the next ninety days and hatch into little baby king cobras  so she protects her eggs 
 and after three months the babies finally do hatch out a majority of them will die of course there is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just
  ten to twelve inches long 
 my first experience with king cobras was in ' seventy two at a magical place called agumbe  in karnataka this state  
 and it is a marvelous rain forest this first encounter was kind of like the
 the maasai boy who kills
  the lion to become a warrior it really changed my life totally  and it brought me straight into the conservation fray 
 i ended up starting this research and education station in agumbe  which you are all of course invited to visit  
 this is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system and
 try to hang on to what 's there make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean and of course
  having a good time too you can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that
 little cottage where we stay when we 're there it was very important for us to get through to the people and
 through the children is usually the way to go they are fascinated with snakes they haven 't got that
 that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way
  interested  and it really works to start with them  
 this gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes this is an average size king cobra about twelve feet long  
 and it actually crawled into somebody 's bathroom and was hanging around there for two or three days the people of this part of india worship the king cobra  and
 they didn 't kill it they called us to catch it now we 've caught more than one hundred king cobras over the last three years  and relocated them in nearby forests
  but in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures [ it
 was necessary ] for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside [ each ] snake  now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets 
 where the babies go after they hatch and remarkable things like this you 're about to see  
 this was just a few days ago in agumbe  i had the pleasure of
  being close to this large king cobra who had caught a venomous pit viper and it does it in such a way that it doesn 't get bitten itself  and
 king cobras feed only on snakes
 over the last breeding season wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra  
 didn 't mate with it actually killed it and swallowed it  we 're still trying to explain and come to terms with
 what is the evolutionary advantage of this but they do also a lot of other remarkable things  this is again something [ we were able to see
  by virtue of the fact that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes  
 this male snake twelve feet long  met another male king cobra  and they did this incredible ritual combat dance 
 it 's very much like the rutting of mammals including humans you know sorting out our differences  but gentler  no biting allowed  it 's just a wresting match  but a remarkable activity 
 now what are we doing with all this information what 's the point of all this
  the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests and our job is to convince the authorities
 that these forests have to be protected and this is one of the ways we do it  by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic
 in the rainforests there  in order to help protect
 trees animals and of course the water sources  you 've all heard perhaps of project tiger which started back in the early
  in fact a very dynamic time for conservation we were piloted i could say by a
 highly autocratic stateswoman  but who also had an incredible passion for environment  
 and this is the time when project tiger emerged and just like project tiger 
 our
 activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything
  it so the tiger is the icon  and now the king cobra is a new one all the major rivers in south india
 are sourced in the western ghats the chain of hills running along the west coast of india 
 it pours out millions of gallons every hour  and supplies drinking water to at least three hundred million
  many babies and of course
 feeds many many animals both domestic and wild  produces thousands of tons of rice 
 and what do we do how do we respond to this well basically we dam it  we pollute it  we pour in pesticides weedicides fungicides  you drink it
 in peril of your life  and the thing is it 's not just big industry it 's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this 
 it 's us it seems that our citizens find
 the best way to dispose of garbage are in water sources  
 okay  now we 're going north very far north 
 north central india the chambal river is where we have our base  this is the home of the gharial this incredible crocodile  
 it is an animal which has
 been on the earth for just about one hundred million years it survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off
 it has remarkable features even though it grows to
 twenty feet long since it eats only fish it 's not dangerous to human beings 
 it does have big teeth however and it 's kind of hard to convince people if an animal has big teeth that it 's a harmless creature 
 but
 we actually back in the early
 if you see the map  the range of their original habitat was all the way from the indus in pakistan to the irrawaddy in burma  
 and now it 's just limited to a couple of spots in nepal and india  
 so
  in fact at this point there are only two hundred breeding gharial left in the wild
  to start projects
 which were basically government supported to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests and release five thousand baby gharial back to the wild  
 and pretty soon we were seeing sights like this 
 i mean  just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again  
 but complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt and sure enough
  with all the other pressures on the river like sand mining for example 
 very very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river 's edge not allowing the animals to breed anymore  we 're looking at
 even more problems building up for the gharial despite the early good intentions their
 nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings it 's just an amazing sight
 this was actually just taken last year  but then the monsoon arrives  and
 unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or there is always a barrage  and shoop they get washed down to their doom  
 luckily there is still a lot of interest my pals in the crocodile specialist group of the
  departments  and the ministry of environment  we all work together on stuff  but it 's possibly and
 definitely not enough
 for example
  in the winter of two thousand and seven and two thousand and eight there was this incredible die off of gharial in the chambal river suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river dead why how could it happen  this is a relatively clean river  the chambal if you look at it
  water people scoop water out of the chambal and drink it something you wouldn 't do in most north indian rivers  
 so  in order to try to find out the answer to this we got veterinarians from all over the world working with indian vets to try to figure out what was happening 
 i was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside and we
 actually looked through
 all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on and it came down to something
  called gout which as a result of kidney breakdown is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body  and
 worse in the joints which made the
 gharial unable to swim  and it 's a horribly painful death 
 just downriver from the chambal is the filthy yamuna river the sacred yamuna river and i hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it 's the truth
  it 's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine it flows down through
 delhi  mathura agra  and
 gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine  
 so  it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain something in the fish they were eating and you know once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected
  these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course  in order to try to answer some of these questions we again turn to technology to
 biological technology in this case again telemetry  putting radios on ten gharial and actually following their movements they 're being watched everyday as we speak to try to find out what this mysterious toxin is 
 the chambal river is an absolutely incredible place it 's
 a place that
  famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits  the dacoits who used to
 work up there and there still are quite a few around but poolan devi was one [ of them ] which actually shekhar kapur made an incredible movie the bandit queen which i urge you to see you 'll get to see the incredible [ chambal ] landscape as well  
 but again  heavy fishing pressures
 one of the last repositories of the ganges river dolphin various species of turtles thousands of migratory birds  
 and fishing is causing problems like this and now
 new elements of human intolerance for for river creatures like the gharial means that
 if they don 't drown in the net then they simply cut their beaks off animals like the ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left and it is also critically
  endangered so who is next us  
 because we are all dependent on these water sources  
 so we all know about the narmada river  the tragedies of dams the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems
 without providing livelihoods  and development just basically going berserk for a double
  we 're not sure where this story is going to end  whether it 's got a happy or sad ending and climate change is certainly going to
 turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads  we 're still working hard at it we 've got a lot of a good team of people working up there  and
 the thing is  you know the decision makers the folks in power they 're up in their bungalows
 so on in delhi in the city capitals they are all supplied with plenty of water it 's cool  but out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really
 bad shape  and it 's a bleak future for them 
 so we have our ganges and yamuna cleanup project we 've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it and nothing to show for it  incredible  
 so  people talk about political will during the die off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action government cut through all the red tape we got foreign vets on it it was great
 so we can do it but if you stroll down to the yamuna or to the gomati in lucknow or to the adyar river in
 chennai or the mula mutha river in pune just see what we 're capable of doing to a river  it 's sad
 but i think the final note really is that
 we can do it  the corporates the artists the wildlife nuts
 the good old everyday folks can actually bring these rivers back  and
 the final word is that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders  
 and there is a gharial looking at us from the river and these are powerful water totems  and they are going to disturb our dreams
 until we do the right thing
  you know most people are
 terrified of snakes and there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra
 bite the dust  do you have those conversations with people how do you really get them to care romulus whitaker i take the
 sort of
 humble approach i guess you could say
  i don 't say that snakes are huggable exactly it 's not like the teddy bear  but
 i sort of
 there is an innocence in these animals and when the average person looks at a cobra going ssssss like that they say my god look at that angry dangerous creature 
 i look at it
 as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being and that is the truth  and that 's what i try to get
 incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed you were saying that that hasn 't been filmed before rw yes
 this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it for one thing as i said it 's just like a little snack for him you know usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes or even cobras  
 but this guy who we 're following right now is in the deep jungle whereas other king cobras very often come
  into the human interface you know the plantations to find big rat snakes and stuff this guy specializes in pit vipers  and the guy who is working there with them he 's from maharashtra  
 he said i think he 's after the nusha now 
 the nusha means the high whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little
 venom rush
