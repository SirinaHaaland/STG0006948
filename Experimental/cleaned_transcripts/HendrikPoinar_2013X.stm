  when i was a young boy  i used to gaze through the microscope of my father
 at the insects in amber that he kept in the house and they were remarkably well preserved morphologically just phenomenal  
 and we used to imagine that someday they would actually come to life and they would crawl
  out of the resin and if they could they would fly away  
 if you had asked me ten years ago whether or not we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals i would have told you it 's unlikely 
 if you had asked whether or not we would actually be able to revive an extinct species i would have said  pipe dream  but i 'm actually standing here today amazingly
  to tell you that not only is the sequencing of extinct genomes a possibility actually a modern day reality  
 but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach maybe not from the insects in amber
 in fact this mosquito was actually used for the inspiration for jurassic park but from woolly mammoths the well preserved remains of woolly mammoths in the permafrost 
 woollies are a particularly interesting quintessential image of the ice age they were large they were hairy they had large tusks and we seem to
  have a very deep connection with them like we do with elephants maybe it 's because elephants
 share many things in common with us they bury their dead they educate the next of kin they have social knits that are very close or maybe it 's actually because we 're bound 
  by deep time because elephants like us share their origins in africa some seven million years ago  
  actually like the elephants migrated out into europe and asia  
 so the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis which was standing four meters tall weighing about ten tons and was a woodland adapted species 
  and spread from western europe clear across central asia across the bering land bridge and into parts of north america  
  and new habitats opened up we had the arrival of a steppe adapted species called trogontherii in central asia pushing meridionalis out into western europe 
 and the open grassland savannas of north america opened up leading to the columbian mammoth a large hairless species in north america  
 and it was really only about five hundred thousand years later that we had the arrival of the woolly the one that we all know and love so much
  an east beringian point of origin across central asia  again pushing the trogontherii out through central europe 
 and over hundreds of thousands of years migrating back and forth across the bering land bridge during times of glacial peaks and coming into direct contact with the columbian relatives living in the south  
 and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years during traumatic climatic shifts so there 's a highly plastic
  animal dealing with great
 transitions in temperature and environment and doing very very well  and there they survive on the mainland until about ten thousand years ago  and actually surprisingly on the small islands 
  off of siberia and alaska until about three thousand years ago  so egyptians are building pyramids and woollies are still living on islands  
 likely due to a warming climate and 
 dense forests that are migrating north and also as the late great paul martin once put it probably pleistocene overkill so the large game hunters that took them down 
 fortunately we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in siberia and alaska and we can actually go up there
 and actually take them out and the preservation is again like
  those insects in [ amber ] phenomenal  
 so you have teeth bones with blood which look like blood you have hair and you have intact carcasses or heads which still have brains in them  
 so the preservation and the survival of dna depends on many factors and i have to admit most of which we still don 't quite understand but depending upon when an organism dies and how quickly he 's buried the depth of that burial
 the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment will ultimately dictate how long dna will survive over geologically meaningful time frames and it
 's probably surprising to many of you sitting in this room that it 's not the time that matters it 's not the length of preservation it 's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most 
 so if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization
 the dna which was once intact tightly wrapped around histone proteins is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime 
  so those bacteria along with the environmental bacteria  free water and oxygen actually break apart the dna into smaller and smaller and smaller dna
  until all you have are fragments that range from ten base pairs to in the best case scenarios a few hundred base pairs in length 
 so most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures 
 but a few of them actually have dna fragments that survive for thousands  even a few millions of years in time 
 and using state of the art clean room technology we 've devised ways that we can actually pull
  away from all the rest of the gunk in there and it 's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if i take a mammoth bone or a tooth and i extract its dna that i 'll get mammoth dna 
 but i 'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth and more complicated i 'll get all the dna that survived in that environment with it so the bacteria the fungi and so on and so forth 
 not surprising then again that a mammoth preserved in the permafrost will have something on the order of fifty percent of its dna being mammoth whereas something like
  the columbian mammoth living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment over its laying in will only have three to ten percent endogenous  
 but we 've come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate  capture and discriminate the mammoth from the non mammoth dna and with the advances in high throughput sequencing we can actually pull out and
  all these small mammoth fragments and place them onto a backbone
 of an asian or african elephant chromosome  and so by doing that we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an asian elephant 
 and what do we know then about a mammoth well  the mammoth genome is almost at full completion  
 and we know that it 's actually really big it 's mammoth  so a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs but an elephant and mammoth genome is about two billion base pairs larger
  and most of that is composed of small repetitive dnas that make it very difficult to actually re jig the entire structure of the genome 
 so having this information allows us to answer one of the interesting relationship questions between mammoths and their living relatives the african and the asian elephant 
 all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago  but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share a most recent common ancestor with asian elephants about
  six million years ago so slightly closer to the asian elephant 
 with advances in ancient dna technology we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that i mentioned and i just wanted to talk about two of them the woolly and the columbian mammoth 
 both of which were living very close to each other
  so when the glaciers were massive in north america  the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones and came into contact with the relatives living to the south  and there they shared refugia  and a little bit more than the refugia it turns out it looks like they were interbreeding 
 and that this is not an uncommon feature in proboscideans because it turns out that large savanna male elephants will outcompete the smaller forest elephants for their females 
  hairless columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies it reminds me a bit of high school unfortunately 
 so this is not trivial given the idea that we want to revive extinct species because it turns out that an african and an asian elephant can actually interbreed and have live young and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo in chester u k in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight 
 so that means that we can actually take asian
  elephant chromosomes modify them into all those positions we 've actually now been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome we can put that into an enucleated cell 
 differentiate that into a stem cell subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm artificially inseminate an asian elephant egg  and over a long and arduous procedure 
 actually bring back something that looks like this now this wouldn 't be an exact replica because the short
 dna fragments that i told you about will prevent us from building the exact structure but it would make something that looked and felt very much like a woolly mammoth did 
 now when i bring up this
 with my friends we often talk about well where would you put it where are
 you going to house a mammoth there 's no climates or habitats suitable well that 's not actually the case it turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of siberia and yukon 
  that actually could house a mammoth remember this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation
  so this landscape would be easily able to house it and i have to admit
 that there [ is ] a part of the child in me the boy in me that would love to see these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost of the north once again  
 but i do have to admit that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders
 whether or not we should  thank you very much
  you 've left us with a question i 'm sure everyone is asking this when you say should we it feels like you 're reticent there and yet you 've
 given us a vision of it being so possible what 's your reticence hendrik poinar i don 't think it 's reticence i think it 's just that
 we have to think very deeply about the implications ramifications of our actions  and so as long as we have good deep discussion like we 're having now
  think we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it but i just want to make sure that we spend time thinking about why we 're doing it first
