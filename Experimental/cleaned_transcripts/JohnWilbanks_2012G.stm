  so i have bad news  i have good news  and i have a task  
 so the bad news is that we all get sick  i get sick  you get sick  
 and every one of us gets sick and the question really is how sick do we get is it something that kills us is it something that we survive is it something that we can
  treat  and we 've gotten sick as long as we 've been people  and so we 've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick  
 and for a long time it was the gods right the gods are angry with me or the gods are testing me right 
 or god  singular more recently is punishing me or judging me  
 and as long as we 've looked for
  we 've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science  which is hypotheses as to why we get sick  
 and as long as we 've had hypotheses about why we get sick we 've tried to treat it as well so this is avicenna he wrote a book over a thousand years ago called the canon of medicine 
 and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today that
 the disease and the medicine must be the same strength the medicine needs to be pure  and in the end we need to test it in people  and so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis
 in human testing 
 right you get some beautiful results even when we didn 't have very good technologies this is a guy named carlos finlay  
 he had a hypothesis that was way outside the box for his time in the late  1800s he thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing 
 he thought it was transmitted by mosquitos  
 and they laughed at him for twenty years they called this guy the mosquito man 
 but he ran an experiment in people
  hypothesis and he tested it in people 
 so he got volunteers to go move to cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever  so some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever  
 and it definitively proved that it wasn 't this magic dust called
 fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever
 but it wasn 't until we tested it in people that we actually knew  
 and this is what those people signed up for this is what it looked like to have yellow fever in cuba at that time you suffered in a tent 
 in the heat  alone and you probably died  
 but people volunteered for this  
 and it 's not just a cool example of a scientific design of experiment in theory they also did this beautiful thing they signed this document  and it 's
  an informed consent document and
 informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society right it 's something that separates us from the nazis at nuremberg  
 enforced medical experimentation it 's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn 't agreement 
 it 's something that protects us from harm from
  from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don 't understand or that we don 't agree to  and so you put together the thread
 of narrative hypothesis experimentation in humans and informed consent and you get what we call clinical study  and it 's how we do the vast majority of medical work it
 doesn 't really matter if you 're in the north the south the east the west 
 clinical studies form the basis of how we
  to look at a new drug right we test it in people we draw blood  we do experiments  and we gain consent for that study to make sure that we 're not screwing people over as part of it  
 but the world is changing around the clinical study which has been fairly well established for tens of years if not fifty to one hundred years 
 so now we 're able to gather data about our genomes but as we saw earlier our genomes aren 't dispositive
  we 're able to gather information about our environment  
 and more importantly we 're able to gather information about our choices because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies our genomes our choices
 and our environment  
 and the clinical methods that we 've got aren 't very good at studying that because they are based on the idea of person to person interaction you interact with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study  
 so this is my grandfather i actually never met him but
 he 's holding my mom and his genes are in
  right  his choices ran through to me  he was a smoker like most people were this is my son  
 so my grandfather 's genes go all the way through to him  and my choices are going to affect his health 
 the technology between these two pictures
 cannot be more different but the methodology for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period we just have better statistics
  the way we gain informed consent
 was formed in large part after world war ii around the time that picture was taken that was seventy years ago  
 and the way we gain informed consent this tool that was created to protect us from harm  now creates silos  so the data that we collect for prostate cancer or for alzheimer 's trials
 goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for alzheimer 's research
 right it can 't be networked  it can 't be integrated  it cannot be used by people who aren 't credentialed  
 so a physicist can 't get access to it without filing paperwork a computer scientist can 't get access to it without filing paperwork  computer scientists aren 't patient  
 they don 't file paperwork  
 and this is an accident these are
  tools that we created to protect us from harm but what they 're doing is protecting us from innovation now 
 and that wasn 't the goal it wasn 't the point right it 's a side effect if you will of a power we created
 to take us for good 
 and so if you think about it  the depressing thing is that facebook would never make a change to something as important as an advertising algorithm with a sample size as small as a phase iii clinical trial  
 we cannot take the information
  from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples  
 and that sucks right so forty five percent of men develop cancer thirty eight percent of women develop cancer one in four men dies of cancer 
 one in five women dies of cancer at least in the united states  
 and three out of the four drugs we give you if you get
  and this is personal to me my sister is a cancer survivor my mother in law is a cancer survivor cancer sucks  
 and when you have it you don 't have a lot of privacy in the hospital you 're naked the vast majority of the time people you don 't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you 
 and when i tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used 
 especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study
  is not thank you god for protecting my privacy it 's outrage
 that we have this information and we can 't use it and it 's an accident  
 so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous 
 two hundred and twenty six billion a year is spent on cancer in the united states  fifteen hundred people a day die in the united states
  and it 's getting worse  
 so the good news is that some things have changed and the most important thing that 's changed is that we can now measure ourselves in ways that used to be the dominion of the health system  
 so a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust i like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid 
 we can reach back and grab that dust  and we can learn a lot about health from it so if our choices are part of our health what we eat is a
  really important aspect of our health so you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food and if enough people do that we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health 
 one interesting thing that came out of this this is an app for iphones called the eatery is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people 's pizza is okay and
 it seems like a trivial result but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish it was done in five months by a startup
  company of a couple of people i don 't have any financial interest in it 
 but more nontrivially we can get our genotypes done and although our genotypes aren 't dispositive they give us clues  
 so i could show you mine it 's just a 's t 's c 's and g 's this is the interpretation of it as you can see i carry a thirty two percent risk of prostate cancer twenty two percent risk of psoriasis and a fourteen percent risk of alzheimer 's disease  
 so that means if
 you told everyone you carry the apoe e4 allele what 's wrong with you right 
 when i got these results i started talking to doctors and they told me not to tell anyone and my reaction is is that going to help anyone cure me when i get the disease 
 and no one could tell me yes  
 and i live in a web world where when you share things beautiful stuff happens not bad stuff so i started putting this in my slide decks  and i got even more obnoxious
  to my doctor and i said i 'd like to actually get my bloodwork  
 please give me back my data so this is my most recent bloodwork as you can see i have high cholesterol  i have particularly high bad cholesterol  and i have some bad liver numbers but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test 
 but look at how non computable this information
  this is like the the photograph of my granddad holding my mom
 from a data perspective  and i had to go into the system and get it out  
 so the thing that i 'm proposing we do here is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype 
 and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records  and we use it to build something together  which is a commons 
  a commons is nothing more than a public good that we build out of private goods  we do it voluntarily and we do it through standardized legal tools we do it through standardized technologies 
 right that 's all a commons is it 's something that we build together because we think it 's important 
 and a commons of data is something that 's really unique because we make it from our own data  
 and although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data and obsess around privacy at least some
  of us really like to share as a form of control 
 and what 's remarkable about digital commonses is you don 't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful 
 so not that many programmers write free software  but we have the apache web server 
 not that many people who read wikipedia edit  but it works
  so as long as some people like to share as their form of control we can build a commons as long as we can get the information out 
 and in biology the numbers are even better so vanderbilt ran a study asking people we 'd
 like to take your biosamples your blood and share them in a biobank and only five percent of the people opted out 
 i 'm from tennessee it 's not the most science positive state in the united states of america 
 but only five percent of the people wanted out  so people like to share  if you give them the opportunity and the choice
  and the reason that i got obsessed with this besides the obvious family aspects is that i spend a lot of time around mathematicians 
 and mathematicians are drawn to places where there 's a lot of data because they can use it to tease signals out of noise  
 and those correlations that they can tease out they 're not necessarily causal agents  but math in this day and
  is like a giant set of power tools
 that we 're leaving on the floor not plugged in in health while we use hand saws 
 if we have a lot of shared genotypes and a lot of shared outcomes and a lot of shared lifestyle choices and a lot of shared environmental information 
 we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people  the choices they make and the health that they create
  as a result of those choices and there 's open source infrastructure to do all of this sage bionetworks is a nonprofit that 's built a giant math system that 's waiting for data 
 but there isn 't any 
 so that 's what i do i 've actually started what we think is the world 's first fully digital fully 
 unlimited in scope  global in participation ethically approved
 clinical research study where you contribute the data  
 so if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust if you reach into your body and grab your genome if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record 
 you can actually go through an online informed consent process because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed
 and you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research
  and the goal is to get one hundred thousand in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we have a statistically significant cohort
 that you can use to take smaller sample sizes from traditional research and map it against 
 so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations between the variations that make us unique
 and the kinds of health that we need to to move forward as a society  and i 've spent a lot of
  time around other commons i 've been around
 the early web i 've been around the early creative commons world and there 's four things that all of these share which is they 're all really simple 
 and so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study you 're not going to see something complicated
 but it 's not simplistic 
 these things are weak intentionally  right because you can always add power and control to a system  but it 's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning  
 and so being simple doesn 't mean being simplistic and being weak
  doesn 't mean weakness those are strengths in the system and open doesn 't mean that there 's no money 
 closed systems corporations make a lot of money on the open web  and they 're one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system 
 and so all of these things are
  of the clinical study that we 've created so you can actually come in all you have to be is fourteen years old willing to sign a contract that says i 'm not going to be a jerk  basically  
 and you 're in you can start analyzing the data  you do have to solve a captcha as well 
 and if you 'd like to build corporate structures on top of it that 's okay too that 's all in the consent  
 so if you don 't like those terms you don 't come in it 's very much the design principles of a commons that we 're trying to bring to health data
 and the other thing about these systems is that it only takes a small number of really unreasonable people working together
 to create them it didn 't take that many people to make wikipedia wikipedia or to keep it wikipedia  
 and we 're not supposed to be unreasonable in health and so i hate this word patient i don 't like being patient when systems are broken  
 and health care is broken
  politics of health care i 'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care  so i don 't want to be patient  and the task i 'm giving to you is to not be patient  
 so i 'd like you to actually try when you go home to get your data you 'll be shocked and offended and i would bet outraged at how hard it is
 to get it  but it 's a challenge that i hope you 'll take and maybe you 'll share it  maybe you won 't if you don 't have anyone in your family who 's sick maybe you wouldn
  be unreasonable 
 but if you do or if you 've been sick  then maybe you would 
 and we 're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there 
 so this is the athena breast health network it 's a study of one hundred and fifty thousand women in california  
 and they 're going to return all the data to the participants of the study in a computable
  to load it into the study that i 've put together so we 'll know exactly how many people are willing to be unreasonable
