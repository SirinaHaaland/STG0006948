  as a child  i was raised by native hawaiian elders
 three old women who took care of me while my parents worked  
 the year is
 we 're watching the rising of the stars
 and the shifting of the tides  it 's a stretch of beach we know so well  
 the smooth stones on the sand
 are familiar to us  
 if you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes  you might dismiss them
  as poor and simple that would be a mistake 
 these women are descendants of polynesian navigators  trained in the old ways
 by their elders  and now they 're passing it on to me 
 they teach me the names of the winds and the rains of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars
 there 's a new moon on the horizon  hawaiians say it 's a good night for fishing  they begin to chant
  when they finish  they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them
  someday the world will be in trouble  people will forget their wisdom  
 it will take elders  ' voices from the far corners of the world
 to call the world into balance you will go far
  away 
 it will sometimes be a lonely road  we will not be there 
 but you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers  
 and you will recognize your ohana  your family  
 and it will take all of you  it will take all of you
 i hold onto all my life because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me 
 the year is two thousand and seven  
 i 'm on a remote island in micronesia satawal is one half mile long
 by one mile wide  it 's the home of my mentor his name is pius mau
 piailug mau is a palu a navigator priest he 's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world 
 there are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island  their tradition is so extraordinary
 that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the pacific without the use of instruments
  they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars  the sequence and direction of waves  the flight patterns of certain birds even the slightest hint of color
 on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy
  when western scientists would join mau on the canoe
 and watch him go into the hull it appeared that an old man was going to rest 
 in fact the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel  
 it is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of
  mau was in fact  gathering explicit data
 using his entire body  it 's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old 
 now science may dismiss this methodology  
 but polynesian navigators use it today
 because it provides them
 an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel
  the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance 
 sometimes i 'd be with mau on a cloud covered night and we 'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island  and he would look out  
 and then he would say okay we go 
 he saw that first glint of light he knew what the weather was going to be three
  days from now 
 their achievements  intellectually and scientifically are extraordinary  and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms 
 we are in such a critical moment of our collective history 
 they have been
  compared to astronauts
 these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes
 thousands of miles from a small island 
 their canoes our rockets their sea our
  the wisdom of these elders is not
 a mere collection of stories
 about old people in some remote spot this is part of our collective narrative  
 it 's humanity 's dna  we cannot afford to lose it 
 the year is two thousand and ten  
 just as the women in hawaii that raised me predicted the world
 is in trouble 
 we live in a society bloated with data  
 yet starved for wisdom  
 we 're connected
  an african shaman said your society worships the jester
 while the king stands in plain clothes 
 the link between the past
 and the future is fragile this i know intimately because
  even as i travel throughout the world
 to listen to these stories and record them 
 i struggle 
 i am haunted
 by the fact that i no longer remember the names of the winds
  and the rains  
 mau passed away five months ago  but his legacy and lessons live on
  sums of knowledge in them 
 as potent as the micronesian navigators 
 that are going dismissed that this is a testament to brilliant brilliant technology and science and wisdom
 that is vanishing rapidly because when an elder dies a library is burned  and throughout the world libraries are ablaze
  i am grateful
 for the fact that i had a mentor like mau who taught me how to navigate  
 and i realize through a lesson that he shared
 that we continue to find our way and this is what he said the island
  and what he meant was  
 if you are voyaging and far from home 
 your very survival depends on everyone aboard  
 you cannot make the voyage alone you were never meant to this whole notion of every man for himself is completely
  always was so in closing i would offer you this 
 the planet
 is our canoe and we are the voyagers  true navigation
 begins in the human heart  it 's the most important map of all together may we journey well
