  can i say how delighted i am to be away from the the calm of westminster and whitehall
  napalm  and she awakened the conscience of the nation of america
 to begin to end the vietnam war 
 this is birhan who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 
 fifteen minutes away from death when she was rescued and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world
  this is tiananmen square a man before a tank
 became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance this next
 is the sudanese girl a few moments from from death a vulture hovering in
  a picture that went round the world
 and shocked people into action on poverty this is neda  the iranian girl who was shot
 while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago  and she is now the focus  rightly so of the youtube
 generation  and what do all these pictures and events have in common what they have in common is
  what we see
 unlocks what we cannot see what we see unlocks the invisible
 ties and bonds of sympathy
 that bring us together
 to become a human community what these pictures demonstrate
 is that we do feel the pain of others  however distantly  what i think these
  pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger
 than ourselves 
 what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions across all faiths 
 across all continents a moral sense
 that not only do we share the pain of others  and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong
  that need righted see injuries that need to be corrected see problems that need to be rectified there is a story about
 olof palme the swedish prime minister going to see ronald reagan in america in the 1980s
 before he arrived ronald reagan said and he was the swedish social democratic prime minister isnt this man a communist
  and ronald reagan said i dont care what kind of communist he is laughter
 ronald reagan asked
 olof palme  the social democratic prime minister of sweden well what do you believe in do you want to abolish the rich he said no 
 i want to abolish the poor our responsibility
 is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full
 i believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic
 that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith  and people of no faith  but i think what 's new
 is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world
 we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet
  who we will meet through the internet
 and through all the modern means of communication that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together
 to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with and i believe that this makes this
 a unique age in human history and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly
 global society
  go back two hundred years
 when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters  
 they protested across britain  they won public opinion over a long period of time  
 but it took twenty four years for the campaign to be successful 
 what could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication
  to win peoples hearts and minds or if you take eglantyne jebb  the woman who created save the children ninety years ago  
 she was so appalled by what was happening in austria
 as a result of the first world war and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated
 families of austria that in britain she wanted to take action but she had to go house to house
  to leaflet to get people to attend a rally in the royal albert hall that eventually
 gave birth to save the children an international organization that is now
 fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world  but what more could she have done
 if shed had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately now look at whats happened
  in the last ten years in philippines in two thousand and one president estrada
 a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime eventually brought it down
 and it was of course called the coup de text then you have in zimbabwe the first election under robert mugabe
 a year ago  because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening
  at the polling stations it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do 
 or take burma and the monks that were blogging out a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening until these blogs told the world
 that there was a repression meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted
  is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world  had
 to be listened to then take iran itself and what people are doing today  
 following what happened to neda 
 people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran any
 by everybody who is blogging changing their address to tehran
  and making it difficult for the security services take therefore what modern technology
 is capable of the power of our moral sense
 allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally that in my view  gives us the first opportunity
 as a community to fundamentally change the world foreign policy can never be the same again it cannot be run by elites its got to be run by listening to
  the public opinions
 of peoples who are blogging who are communicating with each other around the world two hundred years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery one
 hundred and fifty years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people children had the right to education one hundred years ago in most countries in in europe
  the pressure was for the right to vote fifty years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare in the last 50 60 years we have seen fascism anti semitism racism 
 apartheid  discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world  
 i was with nelson mandela a year ago when he was in london
 i was at a concert that he was
  attending to mark his birthday and for the
 creation of new resources for his foundation
 i was sitting next to nelson mandela i was very privileged to do so when amy winehouse came onto the stage 
 and nelson mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and i was explaining
  nelson mandela and i have a lot in common
  my husband too has spent a long time in prison laughter
 nelson mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized
 the challenge for us all he said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain the mountain of challenging and
  then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid
 he said that there was a greater challenge ahead 
 the challenge of poverty of climate change global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation
 of a truly global society we are the first generation which is in a position
  the power of a global ethic
 with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally 
 with the challenges that we now face 
 most of which are global in their nature climate change cannot be solved in one country  but has got to be solved by the world working together a financial crisis just as we have seen could not be solved by america alone or europe alone
  it needed the world to work together  
 take the problems of security and terrorism and equally the problem of human rights and development  they cannot be solved by africa alone  they cannot be solved by america or europe alone 
 we cannot solve these problems
 unless we work together  so the great project of our generation it seems to me 
 is to build for the first time out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize
  a truly global society  
 built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future 
 we have now and are the first generation with the power to do this 
 take climate change is it not absolutely scandalous
 that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem 
 where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that when we want to create a global
 carbon market  
 but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement 
 that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world
 reasons why an institution is not in itself enough
 is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well so you need that global ethic
 of fairness and responsibility across the generations take the financial crisis if
 people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in new york
 or starts in the sub prime market of the united states of america 
 if people can find that that sub prime product has been transferred across nations many many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain and people 's ordinary savings are affected by it 
 then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision you need in the long run for
  for economic growth for jobs as well as for financial stability global economic institutions that make sure that
 growth to be sustained has to be shared  and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect
 our ideas of fairness and responsibility not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years then take development
  partnership we need between our countries
 and the rest of the world the poorest part of the world  
 we do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future  and yet out of peoples desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done 
 i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone
  this is a country of six and a half million people 
 but it has only eighty doctors 
 it has two hundred nurses it has one hundred and twenty midwives you cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people
 with such limited resources or take the girl i met when i was in tanzania a girl called miriam  
 she was eleven years old her parents had both died from aids
  mother and then her father she was an aids orphan being handed across different
 extended families to be to be cared for she herself was suffering from hiv  she was suffering from tuberculosis i met her in a field she was ragged she had no shoes 
 when you looked in her eyes  any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future  
 but there was an unreachable sadness in that girls eyes
 and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that
  moment i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv aids fund
 would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire
  that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture so that africa is not a net importer of food but an exporter of food
  rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world  burma is in chains zimbabwe
 is a human tragedy in sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent 
 in the rwanda children 's museum there is a
  and the children 's museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the rwandan genocide where a million people died
 there is a photograph of a boy called david beside that photograph
 there is the information about his life it said
  last words
 said to his mother who was also tortured to death don 't worry  the united nations are coming 
 and we never did  and that young boy believed
 our promises that we would help people in difficulty in rwanda
  never did 
 so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict ridden states of the world  
 so my argument today is basically this 
 we have the means by which we could create a truly global society  the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors that global
  ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work but we should not lose the chance
 in this generation in this decade in particular with president obama in america with other people working with us around the world 
 to create global institutions for the environment and for finance and for security and for development that make sense of our responsibility to other
 our desire to bind the world together and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist it is said that in ancient
 rome
 that when cicero spoke to his audiences people used to turn to each other and say
 about cicero great speech but it is said that in ancient greece when demosthenes spoke to his audiences people turned to each other and didnt say
  great speech they said let 's march we should be marching towards a global society  thank you
