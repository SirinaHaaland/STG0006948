  which means i paint people
 like this but i 'm here tonight to tell you about something personal that changed my work and my perspective 
 it 's something we all go through and my hope is
  that my experience may be helpful to somebody 
 to give you some background on me i grew up the youngest of eight 
 yes eight kids in my family i have six older brothers and a sister to give you a sense of what that 's like 
 when my family went on vacation we had a bus 
  my supermom would drive us all over town to our various after school activities not in the bus
  we had a regular car too 
 she would take me to art classes and not just one or two  she took me to every available art class from when i was eight to sixteen  
 because that 's all i wanted to do  
 she even took a class with me in new york city now being the youngest of eight
  learned a few survival skills  rule number one  don 't let your big brother see you do anything stupid  
 so i learned to be quiet and neat and careful to follow the rules and stay in line  
 but painting was where i made the rules that was my private world 
 i knew i really wanted to be an artist  my big plan was to be a waitress to support my painting  
 so i continued honing my skills i went to graduate school and i got an mfa and at my first solo show  
 my brother asked me what do all these red dots mean next to the paintings 
 nobody was more surprised than me 
 the red dots meant that the paintings were sold and that i 'd be able
  my apartment had four electrical outlets and i couldn 't use a microwave and a toaster at the same time but still i could pay my rent
  so i was very happy 
 here 's a painting from back around that time
  i needed it to be as realistic as possible it had to be specific and believable 
 this was the place where i was isolated and in total control
  since then i 've made a career of painting people in water  bathtubs and showers
 were the perfect enclosed environment  it was intimate and private and water was this complicated challenge that kept me busy for a decade 
 i made about two hundred of these paintings some of them six to eight feet 
  for this painting i mixed flour in with the bathwater to make it cloudy and i floated cooking oil on the surface
 and stuck a girl in it  and when i lit it up it was so beautiful i couldn 't wait to paint it i was driven by this kind of
 impulsive curiosity 
 always looking for something new to add vinyl steam glass  i once put all this vaseline in my head and hair
 just to see what that would look like
  don 't do that 
 so it was going well  i was finding my way  
 i was eager and motivated and surrounded by artists 
 always going to openings and events i was having some success and recognition
 and i moved into an apartment with more than four outlets  my mom and i would stay up very late
 talking about our latest ideas and inspiring each other  she made beautiful pottery  
 i have a friend named bo who made this painting of his wife and i dancing by the ocean and he called it the light years i
 asked him what that meant and he said well that 's when you 've stepped into adulthood you 're no longer a child 
 but you 're not yet weighed down by the responsibilities of life
  the light years 
 on october eight  two thousand and eleven the light years came to an end  my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer  
 it had spread to her bones and it was in her brain when she told me this i fell to my knees i totally lost it
  and when i got myself together and i looked at her i realized this isn 't about me this is about figuring out how to help her 
 my father is a doctor  and so we had a great advantage having him in charge  and he did a beautiful job taking care of her  
 but i too wanted to do everything i could to help so i wanted to try everything we all did  i researched alternative medicines
  is this what you want me to do and she said no she said pace yourself i 'm going to need you later 
 she knew what was happening and she knew what the doctors and the experts and the internet didn 't know how she wanted to go through this 
 i just needed to ask her  
 i realized that if i tried to fix it
  i would miss it  so i just started to be with her  whatever that meant and whatever situation came up just really listen to her 
 if before i was resisting then now i was surrendering  
 giving up trying to control the uncontrollable and just being there in it with
  time slowed down and the date was irrelevant we developed a routine
 early each morning i would crawl into bed with her and sleep with her  
 my brother would come for breakfast and we 'd be so glad to hear his car coming up the driveway so i 'd help her up and take both her hands
 and help her walk to the kitchen  she had this huge mug she made she loved to drink her coffee out of and
  she loved irish soda bread for breakfast afterwards was the shower  and she loved this part she
 loved the warm water so i made this as indulgent as i could like a spa  my sister would help sometimes  we had
 warm towels
 and slippers ready immediately so she never got cold for a second i 'd blow dry her hair
  my brothers would come in the evenings and bring their kids and that was the highlight of her day 
 over time we started to use a wheelchair and she didn 't want to eat so much  and she used the tiniest
 little teacup we could find to drink her coffee 
 i couldn 't support her myself anymore so we hired an aide to help me with the showers these simple daily activities
  activities
 became our sacred ritual 
 and we repeated them day after day as the cancer grew  it was humbling and painful and exactly
 where i wanted to be we called this time the beautiful awful she died on october twenty six
  two thousand and twelve  it was a year and three weeks after her diagnosis she was gone  
 my brothers sister  and father and i all came together in this supportive and attentive way  
 it was as though our whole family dynamic and all our established roles vanished and we were just all together in this unknown  feeling the same thing
 and taking care of each other
  so grateful
 for them
 as someone who spends most of my time alone in a studio working i had no idea that this kind of connection
 could be so important so healing  this was the most important thing it
 was what i always wanted  so after the funeral it was time for me to go back to
  my studio  
 so i packed up my car and i drove back to brooklyn and painting is what i 've always done so that 's what i did  
 and here 's what happened
 it 's like
 a release of everything that was unraveling in me
  that safe 
 very very carefully rendered safe place that i created in all my other paintings it was a myth  it didn 't work 
 and i was afraid because i didn 't want to paint anymore  
 so i went into the woods  i thought i 'll try that going outside i got my paints  and
  a landscape painter but i wasn 't really much of any kind of painter at all so
 i had no attachment no expectation  which allowed me to be reckless and free  i actually left one of these wet paintings outside overnight
 next to a light in the woods  by the morning it was lacquered with bugs  
 but i didn 't care it didn 't matter it didn 't matter
 i took all these paintings back to my studio and scraped them  and carved into them and poured paint thinner on them put more paint on top drew on them 
 i had no plan 
 but i was watching what was happening 
 this is the one with all the bugs in it 
 i wasn 't trying to represent a real space  it was the chaos and the imperfections that were fascinating
  and something started to happen i got curious again this is another one from the woods 
 there was a caveat now though i couldn 't be controlling the paint like i used to it had to be about implying and suggesting 
 not explaining or describing 
 and that imperfect  chaotic turbulent surface is what told the story
  i started to be as curious as i was when i was a student 
 so the next thing was i wanted to put figures in these paintings people and i loved this new environment so i wanted to have both people and this
 atmosphere when the idea hit me of how to do this i got kind of nauseous and dizzy  which is
 really just adrenaline probably but for me it
  really good sign  and so now i want to show you what i 've been working on it 's
 something i haven 't shown yet and it 's like a preview i guess of my upcoming show what i have so far  
 expansive space instead of the isolated bathtub i 'm going outside instead of
  savoring the imperfections allowing the
 allowing the imperfections  and in that imperfection you can find a vulnerability i could feel my
 my deepest intention what matters most to me 
 that human connection that can happen in a space where there 's no resisting or controlling
  i want to make paintings about that 
 so here 's what i learned we 're all going to have big losses in our lives
 maybe a job or a career relationships love our youth we 're going to lose our
  these kinds of losses are out of our control they 're unpredictable  and they bring us to our knees  and so i say  let them  
 fall to your knees be humbled 
 let go of trying to change it
 or even wanting it to be different it just is 
 and then there 's space and in that space feel your vulnerability
  vulnerability what matters most to you your deepest intention  and be curious to connect
 to what and who
 is really here awake and alive it 's what we all want 
 let 's take the opportunity to find something beautiful
 in the unknown in the unpredictable  and even in the awful  thank you
