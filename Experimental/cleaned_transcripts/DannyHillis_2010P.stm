  i admit that
 i 'm a little bit nervous here because i 'm going to say some radical things about how we should think about cancer differently to an audience that contains a lot of people who
 know a lot more about
 cancer than i do  but i will also contest that i 'm not as nervous as i should be because i 'm pretty sure i 'm right about this 
 and that this in fact will be the way that we treat cancer in the future
  in order to talk about cancer i 'm going to
 actually have to
 let me
 get the big slide here first i 'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics i want to put it in perspective
 of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on
 and then talk about something you haven 't heard so much about which is proteomics having explained those that will set up for what i
 think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer  
 so let me start with genomics  it is the hot topic it is the place where we 're learning the most this is the
  but it has its limitations and in particular you 've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body  
 and if that were only true it would be great but it 's not it
 's like the parts list of your body  it doesn 't say how things are connected what causes what and so on  
 so if i can make an analogy let 's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant
  and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder  so it might be that if you went to a french restaurant
 and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn 't have butter  you could say ah i see what 's wrong with them i can make them healthy 
 and there probably are special cases of that you could certainly tell the difference between a chinese restaurant and a french restaurant by what they had in a
 larder
  the list of ingredients does tell you something and sometimes it tells you something that 's wrong
 if they have tons of salt you might guess they 're using too much salt or something like that  
 but it 's limited because really to know if it 's a healthy restaurant  you need to taste the food you need to know what goes on in the kitchen you need the product of all of those ingredients
  if i
 look at a person and i look at a person 's genome it 's the same thing the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients  
 and so indeed there are times when we can find ingredients that [ are ] bad 
 cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient
 and you have a disease and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease  but most things you really have to know what 's going on in the kitchen
  because mostly sick people used to be healthy people they have the same genome  so the genome really tells you much more about
 predisposition so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list 
 but you really for the most part can 't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person except in some of these special cases 
 so why all the big deal about
 genetics  
 well first of all  it 's because we can read it  which is fantastic it is very useful in certain circumstances it
 's also the great theoretical triumph of biology it
 's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right
 it 's fundamental to darwin and
 mendel and so on and so it 's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical
  construct  so mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing 
 and darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing  and then watson and crick actually looked and
 found one 
 so this happens in physics all the time  you predict a black hole and you look out the telescope and there it is just like you said but it rarely happens in biology
  triumph it 's so good there 's almost a religious experience in biology and darwinian evolution is really the
 core theory  
 so the other reason it 's been very popular is because we can measure it it 's digital  and in fact  thanks to kary
 kary mullis you can basically measure
 your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients
  so for instance by measuring the genome  we 've learned a lot about how we 're related to other kinds of animals
 by the closeness of our genome  or how we 're related to each other the family tree or the tree of life there 's a huge amount of
 information about the genetics
 just by comparing the genetic similarity
 of course in medical application that is very useful because it 's the same kind of information
 that the doctor gets from your family medical history except probably your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do  
 and so by reading the genome we can find out much more about your family than you probably know  
 and so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your
  relatives  but they may be surprising  i did the 23andme thing
 and was very surprised to discover that i am fat and bald 
 but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that 
 but
 mostly
 what you need to know to find out if you 're sick
  but it 's actually what 's going on in your body right now 
 so to do that what you really need to do  you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what 's happening after the genetics and that 's what proteomics is about 
 just like genome mixes the study of all the genes proteomics is the study of all the proteins 
 and the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells actually
  the machines that are operating that 's where the action is basically a human body
 is a conversation going on both within the cells and between the cells and they 're telling each other to grow and to die and
 when you 're sick something 's gone wrong with that conversation and so the trick is unfortunately we don 't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome
 so the problem is that measuring if you try to measure all the proteins it 's a very elaborate process it requires hundreds of steps  
 and it takes a long long time  and it matters how much of the protein it is it could be very significant that a protein changed by ten percent so it 's not a nice digital thing
 like dna and
  problem is somebody 's in the middle of this very long stage they pause for just a moment 
 and they leave something in an enzyme for a second and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don 't work  
 and so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way 
 people have tried very hard to do this i tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it 
 i kept getting this call from this oncologist named david agus  
 and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems
 and i didn 't think this was a very likely one to call back so i kept on giving him to the delay list  and then one day  i get a call from
 john doerr bill berkman and al gore on the same day saying return david agus 's phone call
  patients dying every day because we don 't know what 's going on inside of them we have to have a window into this and he took me through specific
  examples of when he really needed it and i realized wow this would really make a big difference if we could do it  and so i said well let 's look at it applied minds
 has enough play money that
 we can go and just work on something without getting anybody 's funding or permission or anything  so we started playing around with this 
 and as we did it we realized this was the basic problem that taking the sip of coffee that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done
 was to automate this process like an assembly line
  and build robots that would measure proteomics  and so we did that and
 working with david we made a little company called applied proteomics eventually  
 which makes this robotic assembly line which in a very consistent way measures the protein and i 'll show you what that protein measurement looks like
  what we do is we take a drop of blood
 out of a patient  
 and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh how slippery they are 
 and we arrange them in an image  
 and so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once
 out of that drop of blood and we can take a different one tomorrow and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different they 'll be different after you eat or after you sleep
 they really tell us what 's going on there 
 and so this picture which looks like a big smudge to you 
 is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track  
 so if i zoom into that picture  i can just show you what it means we sort out the proteins from left to right is the weight
 of the fragments that we 're getting and from top to bottom
  is how slippery they are so we 're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it and so each of these lines represents some signal that we 're getting out of a piece of a protein 
 and you can see how the lines occur in these little
 groups of bump bump  bump bump bump 
 and that 's because we 're measuring the weight so precisely that carbon comes in different isotopes so if it has an extra neutron on it  we actually measure it as a different
 as
 a different chemical  so we 're actually measuring each isotope as a different one  and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is  so 
 seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time  
 and suddenly you say wow it 's way more complicated than we thought it was but we can see that stuff out there
 and actually see features of it
  so this is the signature out of which we 're trying to get patterns so what we do with this
 is for example we can look at two patients one that responded to a drug and one that didn 't respond to a drug and ask what 's going on differently inside of them 
 and so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients
 and look at the differences so here we have alice in green and bob in red
  we overlay them  this is actual data  and you can see mostly it overlaps and it 's yellow but there 's some things that
 just alice has and some things that just bob has and if we find
 a pattern of things of the responders to the drug  we see that in the blood they have the condition
 that allows them to respond to this drug we might not even know what this protein is  but we can see it 's a marker
 for the response to the disease  so
 this already  i think is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine
  but i think this is actually just the beginning of
 of how we 're going to treat cancer so let me move to cancer the thing about cancer
 when i got into this  i really knew nothing about it but working
  with david agus i started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out and as i looked at it
 to me it didn 't make sense how we were approaching cancer and in order to make sense of it i had to learn
 where did this come from we 're treating cancer almost like it 's an infectious disease we 're treating it as something that got inside
  of you that we have to kill  so this is the great paradigm this is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked
 was the germ theory of disease  so what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose that is put you into a category
 and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis
 and that works great for infectious diseases so
 if we put you in the category of you 've got syphilis we can give you penicillin we know that that works if you 've got malaria we give you quinine
 or some derivative of it  and so that 's the basic thing doctors are trained to do  and it 's miraculous in the case of of
 infectious disease how well it works and many people in this audience probably wouldn 't be alive if doctors didn 't do this
 but now let 's apply that to systems diseases like cancer 
 the problem is that in cancer there isn 't something else that 's inside of you  it 's you you 're broken
 that conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way  so how do we diagnose that conversation
  right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body you know where did it appear  and we put you in different categories
 according to the part of the body and then we
 do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer and we treat these as if they 're separate diseases
 and that this way of dividing them had something to do with
 what actually went wrong and of course
  really doesn 't have that much to do with what went wrong
 because cancer is a failure of the system  
 and in fact  i think we 're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing i think this is the big mistake  
 i think cancer should not be a noun we should talk about cancering
 as something we do not something we have and so those tumors those are symptoms of
  and so your body is probably cancering all the time  but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control  
 and so to give you an idea of an analogy of what i mean by thinking of cancering as a verb  
 imagine we didn 't know anything about plumbing  
 and the way that we talked about it we 'd come home and we 'd find a leak
  that 's kind of the level at which it is kitchen water well first of all we 'll go in there and we 'll mop out a lot of it  and then we know that if we sprinkle drano around the kitchen that helps
  whereas living room water it 's better to do tar on the roof
  sounds silly but that 's basically what we do and i 'm not saying you shouldn 't mop up your water if you have cancer  
 but i 'm saying that 's not really the problem that 's the symptom of the problem  what we really need to get at is the process that 's going on and that 's happening at the level of the proteonomic
 actions happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally
  because normally your body is dealing with this problem all the time so your house is dealing with leaks all the time  but it 's fixing them it 's draining them out and so on 
 so
 what we need is
 to have a causative model of what 's actually going on and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that
  got me invited to give a talk at national cancer institute
 and anna barker was there  and so i gave this talk and said why don 't you guys
 do this and anna said 
 because nobody within cancer would look at it this way  
 but what we 're going to do is we 're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer
 to get together with doctors who really know about cancer
 and
 work out different programs of research so david and i applied to this program and created a consortium
 at usc where we 've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world from cold spring harbor
  austin i won 't even go through and name all the places
 to have a research project that will last for five years
 where we 're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this we 're doing it in mice first  
 and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this  
 but they will die for a good cause  and we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model
 where we can understand when
  actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer  
 so let me just end with giving you a little picture of what i think cancer treatment will be like in the future  
 so i think eventually once we have one of these models for people which we 'll get eventually i mean our group won 't get all the way there but
 eventually we 'll have a very good computer model sort of like a global climate model for weather
  lots of different
 information about what 's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales  and so we will simulate in that model
 for your particular cancer
 and this also will be for als or any kind of system neurodegenerative neurodegenerative diseases things like that
 we will simulate
 specifically you
  not just a generic person but what 's actually going on inside you 
 and in that simulation what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments and it might be very gentle treatments very small amounts of drugs it might
 be things like don 't eat that day or
 give them a little chemotherapy maybe a little radiation
  do surgery sometimes and so on but design a program of treatments specifically for you and 
 help your body guide
 back to health guide your body back to health because your body
 will will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong we put it in the equivalent of splints  and so your body basically has
  lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer and we just have to prop those up in the right way
 and get them to do the job  
 and so i believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future it 's going to require a lot of work a lot of research there
 will be many teams like like our team that that work on this  
 but i think eventually 
 we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer  
 so
