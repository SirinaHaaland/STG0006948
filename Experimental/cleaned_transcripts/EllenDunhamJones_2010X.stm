  in the last fifty years we 've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences and i 'm going to talk about some of those consequences
 and just present a whole bunch of really interesting
 projects that i think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the
  big design and development project of the next fifty years is going to be retrofitting suburbia  so whether it 's redeveloping dying malls or
  dead big box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots  i think the fact is the growing number of empty and
  throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our
  landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places  
 and in the process 
 what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost and have the infrastructure in place  
 instead of continuing
  to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges  so why is this important  i think there are
 any number of reasons and i 'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few just from the perspective of climate change the average urban dweller in the u s has about 
  the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller  mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more and living in detached buildings you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of 
 so
 strictly from a climate change perspective
 the cities are already relatively green  the big opportunity to reduce
 greenhouse gas emissions is actually in
  urbanizing the suburbs all that driving that we 've been doing out in the suburbs we have doubled the amount of miles we drive  it 's increased our 
  dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency we 're just driving so much more we haven 't been able to keep up technologically 
  have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles 
 and those have been linked then with the rather alarming growing rates of obesity shown in these maps here 
 and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a
  developing diabetes and that rate has been escalating at the same rate
 as children not walking to school anymore again because of our development patterns and then there 's finally there 's the affordability question i
 mean how
 affordable is it
 to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices suburban expansion
  to cheap land 
 for the last fifty years you know the cheap land out on the edge has helped generations of families enjoy the american dream  but increasingly the savings promised by
  affordability which is basically our model
 those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs for instance here in atlanta about half
  of households make between $ twenty thousand and $ fifty thousand a year  and they are spending twenty nine percent of their income on housing
 and thirty two percent
 on transportation i mean that 's two thousand and five figures that 's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon you
 know none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs  and they 're not going down
  down any time soon 
 whether you love suburbia 's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips there are reasons why it 's important to retrofit but is it practical  
 i think it is june williamson and i have been researching this topic for over a decade and we 've found over
  and what 's driving the market in particular number one is major demographic shifts  we all tend to think of suburbia as this very
 but that 's really not the case anymore  since two thousand already two thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them  
 we just haven 't caught up
  actual realities of this the reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now the baby boomers
 retiring
 and then then there 's a gap generation x which is a small generation they 're still having kids but generation y hasn 't even started
  of new households will not have kids in them 
 and the market research  consumer research asking the the boomers and gen y what it is they would like what they would like to
  tells us there is going to be a huge demand and we 're already seeing it
 for more urban lifestyles within suburbia 
 that basically the boomers want to be able to age in place and gen y would like to live an urban lifestyle but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia 
 the other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt
  i keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band
  but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots and suburbia is full of them  
 when the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown 
 it made sense to just build surface parking lots  
 but those sites have now
  now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again as we 've just continued to sprawl and they now have a relatively central location  
 it no longer just makes sense that land is more valuable than just surface parking lots  
 it now makes sense to go back in build a deck and build
  on those sites 
 so what do you do with a dead mall dead office park it turns out all sorts of things 
 in a slow economy like ours
 is one of the more popular strategies  
 so this happens to be a dead mall in st louis that 's been  re inhabited as art space it 's now home to artist studios theater groups dance troupes it 's not pulling in
  much tax revenue as it once was but it 's serving its community  it 's keeping the lights on
 it 's becoming i think a really great institution 
 other malls have been re inhabited as nursing homes as universities  and as all variety of office space  
 we also found a lot of examples
  been converted into all sorts of community serving uses as well
 lots of schools lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one 
 this was a little grocery store a food lion grocery store that is now a public library 
 in addition to i think doing a beautiful adaptive reuse they tore up some of the parking spaces put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff put in a lot more
  to connect to the neighborhoods
 and they 've made this what was
 just a store along a commercial strip into a community gathering space  this one is a little 
  l shaped strip shopping center in phoenix arizona really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint a gourmet grocery
  and they put up a restaurant in the old post office never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination it 's been so successful they 've now taken over the strip across the street
 the real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim walking distance to le grande orange 
 because it provided its neighborhood with what
  if home is the first place and work is the second place  
 the third place is where you go to hang out and build community  and especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family the
 family households there 's a real hunger for more third places
 so the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category the next strategy redevelopment now during the boom
 there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density a sort of compact  walkable urban neighborhoods  
 but some of them have been much more incremental  this is mashpee commons the oldest retrofit that we 've found and it 's just
  over the last twenty years built urbanism on top of its parking lots  
 so the black and white photo shows the simple sixty 's strip shopping center and then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact mixed use new england village 
 and it has plans now that have been approved
 for it to
  sometimes it 's incremental  sometimes it 's all at once 
 this is another infill project on the parking lots  this one of an office park outside of washington d c 
 when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site 
 the owners decided to
 build a new parking deck and then insert
  top of their surface lots a new main street several apartments and condo buildings  while keeping the existing office buildings  
 here is the site in one thousand nine hundred and forty it was just a little farm in the village of hyattsville by one thousand 
 nine hundred and eighty it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right
  today the transit the main street and the new housing have all been built eventually  i expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment 
  of the mall plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to to be redeveloped transit is a big driver of
  so here 's what it looks like you can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street  
 this one is one of my favorites belmar  i think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all green construction there 's massive p v arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines  
 this was a very large mall on a
  blocks
 with public streets two public parks eight bus lines and a range of housing types  
 and so it 's really given lakewood colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had 
 here was the mall in its heyday  they had their prom in the mall they loved their mall
  the mall has died  the department store has been kept and we found this was true in many cases the department stores are multistory they 're better built they 're easy to be 
 but the one story stuff that 's really history  so here it is at projected build out this project i think has great connectivity
  to the existing neighborhoods it 's providing one thousand five hundred households with the option of a more urban lifestyle  it 's about two thirds built out right now 
 here 's what the new main street looks like it 's very successful  and it 's helped to prompt
 eight of the thirteen regional malls in denver have now or have announced plans to be retrofitted  
 but it 's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring just
 bulldozers are coming and just
  plowing down the whole city no it 's pockets of walkability on the sites of under performing properties 
 and so it 's giving people more choices  but it 's not taking away choices  
 but it 's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability 
 you want to also try to get more systemic transformation we need to also retrofit the corridors
  themselves  so this is one that has been retrofitted in california 
 they took the commercial strip shown on the black and white images below  and they built a boulevard that has become the main street for their town  and it 's transformed from being an ugly  unsafe  
 undesirable address to becoming
  sort of good address i mean now we 're hoping we start to see it they 've already built city hall attracted two hotels
  i could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree  
 so there 's a lot of great things but i 'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting  but densification is not going to work everywhere
 there 's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs
 in cities like flint michigan  there 's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement sort of victory gardens meets the internet  
 but perhaps one of the most important re greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology as in this example outside of minneapolis
  when the shopping center died  
 the city restored the site 's original wetlands creating lakefront property  which then attracted private investment the first private investment to this very low income neighborhood in over forty years  
 so they 've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy
 at the same time this is another re greening example it also makes sense in very strong markets  this one in seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot
  adjacent to a new transit stop and the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit  the creek had been culverted under the parking lot but daylighting our creeks really
 improves their water quality and contributions to habitat
 so i 've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits what 's next i think we have three challenges for the future
  first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale  we need to be able to target which areas really should 
  be re greened where should we be redeveloping  and where should we be encouraging  re inhabitation 
 atlanta one hundred years from now and we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves expensive but simple 
 one in a hundred years  transit on all major rail and road corridors 
 two in a hundred years thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors it 's a little extreme  but we 've got a little water problem 
 in a hundred years
 that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit
  the architectural design quality of the retrofits  
 and i close with this image of democracy in action  this is a protest that 's happening on a retrofit in silver spring maryland on an astroturf town green 
 now retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism
  not without reason you don 't get much more phony than an astroturf town green
  i have to say these are very hybrid places they are new but trying to look old they have urban streetscapes but suburban parking ratios 
  their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia but they 're less diverse than cities and
  public places but that are managed by private companies 
 and just the surface appearance are often like the astroturf here
 they make me wince so you know
 i mean i 'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job the fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks the streets and blocks the putting in of public space
  compromised as it may be is still a really great thing but we 've got to get the architecture better the final challenge is for all of you 
 i want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places more sustainable places period  but
 culturally
  we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic and we expect that but we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to 
 it 's time to let them grow up 
 so i want you to all support the zoning changes  the road diets the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you
