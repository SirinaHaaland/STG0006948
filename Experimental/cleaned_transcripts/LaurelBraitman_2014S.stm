  unstable male that i completely lost my heart to
  and i adopted him and about six months in we realized that he was a mess  he had such paralyzing separation anxiety that we couldn 't leave him alone once he jumped out of our third floor apartment  
 he ate fabric he ate things  recyclables  he hunted flies that didn 't exist he suffered from hallucinations he was diagnosed with a canine
  compulsive disorder and that 's really just the tip of the iceberg  but
 like with humans
  sometimes it 's six months in before you realize that the person that you love has some issues 
 and most of us do not take the person we 're dating
 back to the bar where we met them
  back to the friend that introduced us or sign them back up on match com 
 we love them anyway  and we stick to it  and that is what i did
 with my dog  and i was a i 'd studied
  in history of science from mit  and had you asked me ten years ago if a dog i loved or just dogs generally had emotions i would have said yes but i 'm not sure that i would have told you 
  that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder a prozac prescription and a therapist
  it cracked open my world  
 and i spent the last seven years actually looking into this topic of mental illness in other animals can they be mentally ill like people and if so what does it mean about us  and
 what i discovered is that i i do believe they can suffer from mental illness and actually
 looking and trying to identify mental illness in them often helps us be better friends to them and also can help
  us better understand ourselves  
 so let 's talk about diagnosis for a minute  many of us think that we can 't know what another animal is thinking 
 and that is true  
 but any of you in relationships at least this is my case just because you ask someone that you 're with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn 't mean that they can tell you 
 they may not have words to explain
  what it is that they 're feeling  and they may not know it 's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress 
 before the early 20th century physicians often diagnosed emotional distress in their patients just by observation  
 it also turns out that thinking about mental illness in other animals isn 't actually that much of a stretch most mental disorders in the united states are
  are fear and anxiety disorders  and when you think about it fear and anxiety are actually really extremely helpful animal emotions
  usually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous and once we feel them we then are motivated to move away from whatever is dangerous 
 the problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don 't call for it
  unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal  and obsessive compulsive disorders also
 are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing which is keeping yourself clean and groomed
  this tips into the territory of mental illness when you do things like compulsively over wash your hands or paws  or you develop a ritual that 's so extreme that you can 't sit down to a bowl of food unless you engage
 in that ritual
 so
 for humans  we have the diagnostic and statistical manual which is basically an atlas of the currently agreed upon mental disorders 
 in other animals  we have youtube 
 laughter this is just one search i did for ocd dog but i encourage all of you to
  you will be shocked by what you see  i 'm going to show you just a couple examples this is an example of
 i know and it 's funny and in some ways it 's cute 
 the issue though is that dogs can develop compulsions like this that they then engage in all day  so they won 't go for a walk they won 't hang out with their friends they
  'll develop fixations like chasing their tails compulsively 
 here 's an example of a cat named gizmo  he looks like he 's on a stakeout
 but he does this for many many many hours a day he just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw at the screen 
 this is another example of what 's considered a stereotypic behavior
  this is a sun bear at the oakland zoo named ting ting and if you just sort of happened upon this scene you might think that ting ting is just playing with a stick but ting ting does this all day  and 
  if you pay close attention and if i showed you guys the full half hour of this clip you 'd see that he does the exact same thing in the exact same order and he spins the stick in the exact same way every time 
  move from side to side many of us do this and sometimes
 it 's an effort to soothe ourselves and i think in other animals that is often the case too  but it 's not just stereotypic behaviors that other animals engage in 
 this is gigi she 's a gorilla that lives at the franklin park zoo in boston she actually has a harvard psychiatrist and she 's been treated for a mood disorder among other things many
  animals develop mood disorders lots of creatures this horse is just one example develop 
  'll gnaw on things or do other things that may also soothe them even if they 're self destructive which could be considered similar to the ways that some humans cut themselves 
 plucking turns out if you have fur or feathers or skin you can pluck yourself compulsively
  some parrots actually have been studied to better understand trichotillomania or compulsive plucking in humans something that affects twenty million americans right now  
 lab rats pluck themselves too in them it 's called barbering 
 canine veterans of conflicts of iraq and afghanistan are coming back with what 's considered canine ptsd and they 're having a hard time reentering civilian life when they come back from deployments they can be too scared to approach men with
  beards or to hop into cars  
 i want to be careful and be clear though  i do not think that canine ptsd is the same as human ptsd  
 but i also do not think that my ptsd is like your ptsd  or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours  we are all different
  raised in the same household exposed to the very same things one may develop say
 a debilitating fear of motorcycles or a phobia of the beep of the microwave and another one is going to be just fine  so
 one thing that people ask me pretty frequently is this just an instance of humans driving other animals crazy or is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse  and it turns out we 're actually so
  much more complicated than that  so
 one great thing that has happened to me is recently i published a book on this and
 every day now that i open my email or when i go to a reading or even when i go to a cocktail party people tell me their stories of the animals that they have met and recently i did a reading in california and a woman raised her hand after the talk and
  she said dr braitman i think my cat has
 ptsd and i said well why tell me a little bit about it so ping is her cat  she was a rescue 
 and she used to live with an elderly man and one day the man was vacuuming and he suffered a heart attack and he died 
 a week later  ping was discovered in the apartment
 alongside the body of her owner  and the vacuum had been running the
  entire time 
 for many months up to i think two years after that incident
  she was so scared she couldn 't be in the house when anyone was cleaning she was quite literally a scaredy cat she would hide in the closet she was un self confident and shaky  but with the loving support of her family a lot of a time and their
  three years later she 's actually a happy  confident cat 
 another story of trauma and recovery that i came across was actually a few years ago i was in thailand to do some research  i met a monkey named 
  was a baby  he was attacked by a pack of dogs and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm  
 and  boonlua dragged himself to a monastery where the monks took him in they called in a veterinarian
  who treated his wounds  
 eventually  boonlua wound up at an elephant facility  and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing and they figured out what he liked which it turned out was mint mentos and
 rhinoceros beetles and eggs  but they worried because he was social that he was lonely and they didn 't want to put him in with another monkey
 because they thought with just one arm he wouldn 't be able to defend himself or even play  and so they gave him a rabbit 
 and boonlua was immediately a different monkey he was extremely happy to be with this rabbit they groomed each other they become close friends and then the rabbit had bunnies  
  and boonlua was even happier than he was before  and it had in a way given him a reason to wake up in the morning and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up that he decided not to sleep
 bunnies  and he stopped sleeping and he would sort of nod off while trying to take care of them  
 in fact he was so protective and so affectionate with these babies that the sanctuary eventually had to take them
 away from him because he was so protective he was worried that their mother might hurt them  so after they were taken away the sanctuary staff worried that he would fall into a depression and so to avoid
  my official opinion is that he does not look depressed 
 so
 one thing that i would really like people to feel is that you really should feel empowered
 to make some assumptions about the creatures that you know well so when it comes to your dog or your cat or maybe your one armed monkey that you happen to know  if you think
 that they are traumatized or depressed you 're probably right
  this is extremely anthropomorphic or the assignation of human characteristics onto non human animals or things  
 i don 't think though that that 's a problem i don 't think that we can not anthropomorphize it 's not as if you can take your human brain out of your head and put it in a jar and then use it to think about another animal
 we will always be one animal wondering about the emotional experience of another animal so then the choice becomes how do you  anthropomorphize well  or do you anthropomorphize poorly 
 and anthropomorphizing poorly is all too common 
 laughter it may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding or getting too close to exotic wildlife because you believe that you had a spiritual connection there 's all manner of
  anthropomorphizing well however  i believe is based on accepting our animal similarities with other species and using them to make assumptions that are informed about other animals 
 ' minds and experiences and there 's actually an entire industry that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well  and
  that is the psychopharmaceutical industry 
 one in five americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications to the antipsychotics 
 it turns out that we owe this entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal to other animals these drugs were tested in non human animals first and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects
  the very popular antipsychotic thorazine first relaxed rats before it relaxed
 people the antianxiety medication librium was given to cats selected for their meanness in the  1950s
 and made them into peaceable felines and even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits  
 today however we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects but they 're giving them these drugs as patients 
 both in ethical and much less
  ethical ways  seaworld gives mother orcas
 antianxiety medications when their calves are taken away
  many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics and antianxiety medications but dogs like my own oliver
 are given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications to keep them from jumping out of buildings or jumping into traffic just recently actually a study came out in
  science that showed that even crawdads responded to antianxiety medication  
 it made them braver less skittish and more likely to explore their environment it
 's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs but i can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry is immense and growing 
 from seven billion dollars in two thousand and eleven to a projected nine point two five billion by the
 and fifteen 
 some animals are on these drugs indefinitely  
 others like one bonobo who lives in milwaukee at the zoo there was on them until he started to save his paxil prescription and then distribute it among
  are many many many other therapeutic interventions that help other creatures and here is a place where i think actually that veterinary medicine can teach something to human medicine which is if you take your dog who is say compulsively chasing his tail
  into the veterinary behaviorist their first action isn 't to reach for the prescription pad it 's to ask you about your dog 's life  they want to know how often your dog gets
  outside  they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting  they want to know how much social time with other dogs and other humans  they want to talk to you about what sorts of therapies  largely behavior therapies you 've tried with that animal 
 those are the things that often tend to help the most especially when combined with 
  i believe that helps the most particularly with social animals is time with other social animals 
 in many ways  i feel like i became a service animal to my own dog  
 and i have seen parrots do it for people and people do it for parrots and dogs do it for elephants and elephants do it for other elephants 
  know about you i get a lot of internet forwards of unlikely animal friendships i also think it 's a
 huge part of facebook the monkey that adopts the cat  or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn  or the cow that makes friends with the pig  and
 had you asked me eight nine years ago about these i would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way and maybe even staged
  and what i can tell you now is that there is actually something to this
  this is legit in fact 
 some interesting studies have pointed to oxytocin levels which are a kind of bonding hormone that we release when we 're having sex or nursing or around someone that we care for extremely 
 oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs who care about each other or who enjoy each other 's company  and beyond that other studies show that
  oxytocin raised even in other pairs of animals so say in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other their levels spiked afterwards  
 i have a friend who really showed me that mental health is in fact a two way street his name is lonnie hodge and he 's a veteran of vietnam 
 when he returned he started working with survivors of genocide and a lot of
  people who had gone through war trauma and he had ptsd and also a fear of heights because in vietnam he had been rappelling backwards out of helicopters over the skids  
 and he was givena service dog named gander a labradoodle to help him with ptsd and his fear of heights this is them actually on the first day that they met 
 which is amazing
  since then they 've spent a lot of time together visiting with other veterans suffering from similar issues  
 but what 's so interesting to me about lonnie and gander 's relationship is about a few months in gander actually developed a fear of heights  
 probably because he was watching lonnie so closely 
 what 's pretty great about this though is that he 's still a fantastic service dog because now when they 're both at a great height lonnie is so concerned with gander 's
  forgets to be scared of the heights himself 
 since i 've spent so much time
 with these stories digging into archives  i literally spent years doing this research  and it 's changed me 
 i no longer look at animals at the species level  i look at them as individuals and i think about them as creatures with their own individual weather systems
 guiding their behavior and informing how they respond to the world  
 and i really believe that this has made me a more curious and a more empathetic person both to the animals that
 share my bed and occasionally wind up on my plate  but also to the people that i know
 who are suffering from anxiety and from phobias and all manner of other things  and i really
  do believe that even though you can 't know exactly what 's going on in the mind of a pig or your pug or your partner 
 that that shouldn 't stop you from empathizing with them 
 the best thing that we could do for our loved ones is perhaps
  mind at some point thankfully we can often find them again but only with each other 's help thank you
