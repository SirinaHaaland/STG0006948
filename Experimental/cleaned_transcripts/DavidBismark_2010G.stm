  few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does we stand in elections we vote in elections we observe elections 
 our democracies rely on
  we all understand why we have elections  and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote we cherish the opportunity to have our say 
 to help decide the future of the country 
 the fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us 
 to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all  
 without that mandate they would be corrupt  well unfortunately power corrupts
  and so people will do lots of things
 to get power and to stay in power  including doing bad things to elections 
 you see  even if the idea of the election is perfect 
 running a countrywide election is a big project  and big projects are messy  
 whenever there is an election it seems like something always goes wrong
  tries to cheat or something goes accidentally awry
 a ballot box goes missing here  chads are left hanging over here 
 to make sure as few things as possible go wrong we have all these procedures around the election so for example you come to the polling station and a
 poll station worker asks for your id before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a
 voting booth to fill out your vote  
 when you come back out you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes so that no one knows how you voted  
 well what i want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that after you drop your vote into the ballot box 
 and most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted because they trust that the
  election system works  they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly 
 the ballot boxes go to counting places  they 're unsealed and the votes are poured out
 and laboriously counted most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote  and we all have to trust that that happens correctly
 for all the votes in the election  so
 we have to trust a lot of people  we have to trust a lot of procedures  
 and sometimes we even have to trust computers  
 so imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions
  all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong
 causing all these bad headlines  
 and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better  
 well in the face of all these bad headlines researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently  
 they 've zoomed
  out and looked at the big picture  and the big picture is this elections should be verifiable 
 voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly  
 without breaking election secrecy  which is so very important  
 and that 's the tough part how do we make an election system completely verifiable
  keeping the votes absolutely secret well the way we 've come up with
 uses computers but doesn 't depend on them and the secret is the ballot form 
 and if you look closely at these ballot forms you 'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one  and that means if you mark your choices on one of them
  and then remove the candidate list i won 't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for and on each ballot form there is this
 encrypted value in the form of this 2d barcode on the right  and there 's
 some complicated cryptography going on in there 
 but what 's not complicated is voting with one of these forms  
 so we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us and then we 'll use the paper
 for verification
  so this is how you vote you get one of these ballot forms
 at random  and then you go into the voting booth  and you mark your choices  
 and you tear along a perforation  
 and you shred the candidate list  and the bit that remains the one with your marks this is your encrypted vote so you
  let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote and because it 's encrypted it can be submitted stored and counted centrally
 and displayed on a website for anyone to see  including you so
 you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt  and after the close of the election you can check that your vote was counted by
  comparing your
 receipt
 to the vote on the website 
 and remember the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth  
 so if an election official wants to find out how you voted  they will not be able to 
 if the government wants to find out how you voted  they won 't be able to 
 no hacker can break in and find out how you voted
  no hacker can break in and change your vote because then it won 't match your receipt votes can 't go missing
 because then you won 't find yours when you look for it 
 but the election magic doesn 't stop there  instead we want to make the whole process so transparent
  that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to
 can download all the election data and do the count themselves  
 they can check that all the votes were counted correctly  they can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one  
 and these are elections by the people for the people  so the next step for our democracies
 are transparent and verifiable elections  thank you
