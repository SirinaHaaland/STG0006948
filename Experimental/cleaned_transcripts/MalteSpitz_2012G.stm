  mobile phone
 gives you individual freedom 
 with a mobile phone  you can shoot a crime against humanity in syria 
 with a mobile phone you can
 tweet a message and start a
 protest in egypt 
 with a mobile phone you can record a song  load it up to soundcloud and become famous 
 all this is possible with your mobile phone  
 i 'm a child of one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and
 i live in the city of berlin let 's go back to that
  to this city 
 here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change 
 this is autumn one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine 
 and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change
 had a mobile phone in their pocket  who in the room has a mobile phone with you hold it up  hold your phones up hold your phones up
  hold it up an android a blackberry  wow that 's a lot almost everybody today has a mobile phone  but
 today i will talk about me and my mobile phone  and how it changed my life  and
 i will talk about
  eight hundred and thirty lines of information  raw data and
 why are these informations there  
 because in the summer of two thousand and six the e u commission tabled a directive  
 this directive [ is ] called data retention directive  this directive says
 that each phone company in europe
  each internet service company all over europe  has to store a wide range of information about the users 
 who calls whom 
 who sends whom an email  who sends whom a text message and if you use your mobile phone  where you are 
 all this
  stored for at least six months up to two years by your phone company or your internet service
 provider 
 and all over europe  people stood up and said we don 't want this 
 they said we don 't want this data retention we want 
  and we don 't want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about us  
 they were lawyers  journalists  priests they all said we don 't want this 
 and here you can see like ten thousands of people went out on the streets of berlin and said freedom not fear 
 and some even said  this would be stasi two
  stasi was the secret police in east germany  and i
 also ask myself  does it really work can they really store all this information about us  every time i use my mobile phone  
 so i
 asked my phone company deutsche telekom which was at that time the largest phone company
  and i asked them please send me all the information you have stored about me 
 and i asked them once and i asked them again  and i got no real answer it was only blah blah answers
  but then i said i want to have this information  because this is my life you are protocoling  so i decided
 to start a lawsuit against them because i wanted
  telekom said no we will not give you this information  
 so at the end i had a settlement with them 
 i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for because in the mean time the german constitutional court ruled
 that the implementation of this e u directive into german law was
  so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c d inside and on the c d this was on
 thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information
 at first i saw it and i said okay it 's a huge file okay  
 but then after a while i realized  this is my life  this is six months of my life  into this file
 so i was a little bit skeptical  what should i do with it  because
 you can see where i am where i sleep at night  what i am doing  
 but then i said i want to go out with
  i want to make them public  because i want to show the people what does data retention mean  so
 together with zeit online and open data city i did this
 this is a visualization of six months of my life 
 you can zoom in and zoom out you can wind back and fast forward  you can see every step i take  
  you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne  and how often i call in between 
 all this is possible with this information  
 that 's a little bit scary  
 but it is not only about me 
 it 's about all of us  first it 's only like i call my wife
  and she calls me and we talk to each other a couple of times 
 and then there are some friends calling me and they call each other  
 and after a while you are calling you and you are calling you and you have this great communication network 
 but you can see how your people are communicating with each other
  what times they call each other when they go to bed
 you can see all of this you can see the hubs like who are the leaders in the group 
 if you have access to this information  you can see what your society is doing  
 if you have access to this information you can control your society
 this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran
  blueprint how to survey your society  because you know who talks to whom who sends whom an email all this is
 possible if you have
 access to this information  and this information is stored for at least six months in europe up to two years 
 like i said at
  imagine that all those people on the streets of berlin in autumn of one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine had a mobile phone in their pocket and
 the stasi would have known who took part at this protest  and if the stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it
 this may never have happened the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not [ have been ] there
  and in the aftermath also not the fall of the iron curtain 
 because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us  online and offline 
 they want to have the possibility to track our lives  and they want to store them for all time 
 but
 and living in the digital age is no contradiction
  but you have to fight for your 
  today you have to fight for it every day  so  when you go home  tell your friends
 that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it 's not outdated  
 when you go home  tell your representative
  only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information they don 't have to do it  
 and if you don 't
 believe me ask your phone company what information they store about you  
 so in the future every time you use your
  mobile phone let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for 
  in the digital age  thank you
