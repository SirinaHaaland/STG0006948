 that
  this is an ode to the mother goddess that most of us in india learn when we are children  i learned it
 when i was four
 at my mother 's knee 
 that year she introduced me to dance
 and thus began my tryst with classical dance  since then it 's been four decades now
 i 've trained with the best in the field  performed across the globe  
 taught young and old alike created collaborated  choreographed  and wove
 a rich tapestry of artistry achievement and awards
 the crowning glory was in two thousand and seven when i received this country 's fourth highest civilian award the padma shri for my contribution to art 
 but nothing  nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the
  until then cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend  stage was what i performed on  and grades were what i got in school
  that day  i realized i had an unwelcome  uninvited  new life partner  
 as a dancer i know the nine rasas or the navarasas 
 anger  valor  disgust humor
 and fear  i thought i knew what fear was that day  i learned what fear was
 overcome
 with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control i shed copious tears
 and asked my dear husband jayant i said is this it is this the end of the road 
 is this the end of my dance and he the positive soul that he is 
  this is just a hiatus a hiatus during the treatment and you 'll get back to doing what you do best i realized then
 that i who thought i had complete control of my life had control of only three things  my thought my mind
 the images that these thoughts created and the action that derived from it 
  so here i was
 wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you with the enormity of the situation  
 wanting to go to a place of healing health and happiness i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be 
 for which
 i needed something i needed something that would pull me out of all this so i dried my tears
  and i declared to the world at large i said cancer 's only one page in my life  and i will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life 
 i also declared to the world at large that i would ride it out and i would not allow cancer to ride me 
 but to go from where i was to where i wanted to be  i needed something i needed an anchor an image  a peg
 to
 peg to peg this process on so that i could go
  from there  and i found that in my dance my dance my strength my energy my passion my very life breath  
 but it wasn 't easy  believe me it definitely wasn 't easy  how do you keep cheer
 when you go from beautiful to bald in three days  how do you not despair when
  when with the body ravaged by chemotherapy  climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture 
 that to to someone like me who could dance for three hours  
 how do you not get overwhelmed by the
 despair and the misery of it all all i wanted to do was curl up and weep but
 i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have 
  would drag myself into my dance studio body mind and spirit every day into my dance studio and learn
 everything i learned when i was four all over again reworked relearned regrouped it was excruciatingly painful  but i did it 
 difficult  
 i focused on my
  on the imagery of my dance on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself 
 and slowly  i moved out of that miserable state of mind 
 but i needed something else  i needed something to go that extra mile  and i found it in that metaphor
 which i had learned
 from my mother when i was four the metaphor of mahishasura
  the mother goddess the fearless one created by the pantheon of hindu gods  
 durga  resplendent bedecked beautiful her eighteen arms
 ready for warfare as she rode astride her lion
 into the battlefield to destroy mahishasur  durga the epitome of creative feminine energy or shakti
  durga the fearless one  
 i made that image of durga and her every attribute her every nuance my very own powered by the symbology of a myth
 and the passion of my training  i brought  laser sharp focus into my dance laser sharp focus to such an extent that i
 danced a few weeks after surgery  
 i danced through chemo and radiation cycles much to the dismay of my oncologist 
 i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule 
 what i had done is i had tuned out of cancer
 and tuned into my dance  yes cancer has just been one page in my life
  my story
 is a story of overcoming setbacks obstacles
 and challenges that life throws at you  my story is the power of thought  my story
 is the power of choice it 's the power of focus it 's the power of bringing ourselves
 to the attention of something that so animates you so moves you that something even like cancer
  becomes insignificant  
 my story is the power of a metaphor it 's the power of an image  mine was that of durga  durga the fearless one 
 she was also called simhanandini the one who rode the lion 
 as i ride out  as i ride
  my own inner strength my own inner resilience 
 armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment  
 as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer asking my rogue cells to behave 
 i want to be known not as a cancer survivor but as a cancer conqueror  i present to you an excerpt of that work
