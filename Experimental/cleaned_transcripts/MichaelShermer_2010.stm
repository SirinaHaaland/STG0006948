  so since i was here last in ' six we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue so we covered that
 fairly extensively in skeptic magazine we investigate
  but it turns out we don 't have to worry about any of this because the world 's going to end in two thousand and twelve another update  you will recall
 i introduced you guys to the quadro tracker it 's
 like a water dowsing device it 's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around and you walk around and it points to things like if you 're looking for marijuana in students ' lockers it
  this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls  especially if you 're at a golf course and you check under enough
 bushes 
 well under the category of what 's the harm of silly stuff like this 
 this device the ade six hundred and fifty one was sold to the iraqi government for forty thousand dollars apiece it 's just like this one completely worthless 
 in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction
 which translates to pseudoscientific baloney would be the nice word
 in which you string together
 a bunch of words that sound good but it does absolutely nothing in this case  at
 trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device
 said they were okay  actually cost
  so there is a danger to pseudoscience in believing in
 this sort of thing  
 so what i want to talk about today is belief i want to believe  
 and you do too and in fact i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things it is the default option  we just believe we believe all sorts of things 
 belief is natural disbelief skepticism  science is not
  's more difficult it 's uncomfortable to not believe things  
 so like fox mulder on x files who wants to believe in ufos  well we all do and the reason for that is because
 we have a belief engine in our brains essentially 
 we are  pattern seeking primates we connect the dots a is connected to b b is connected to c and sometimes a really is connected to b and that 's called
  we find patterns we make those connections whether it 's pavlov 's dog here
 associating the sound of the bell with the food and then he salivates to the sound of the bell or whether it 's a skinnerian rat in which he 's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it and therefore he repeats the behavior  
 in fact what skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there
 if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern 
 they will figure out any kind of pattern and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice
  and that 's called superstition and that i 'm afraid we will always have with us i call this process
  tendency to find meaningful patterns
 in both meaningful and meaningless noise when we do this process we make two types of errors a type i error or false positive 
 is believing a pattern is real when it 's not our second type of error is a false negative a type ii error
 is not believing a pattern is real when
  it is so let 's do a thought experiment you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of africa 
 your name is lucy okay   and you hear a rustle in the grass 
 is it a dangerous predator or is it just the wind your next decision could be the most important one of your life 
 well if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it 's just the wind you 've made an error in cognition made a type i error false positive 
 but no harm you just move away you 're more
  cautious  you 're more vigilant  
 on the other hand if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it 's a dangerous predator  you 're lunch  
 you 've just won a darwin award  you 've been taken out of the gene pool  
 now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a type i error is less than the cost of making a type ii error this is the only equation in the talk by the way 
 we have a pattern detection problem
  that is assessing the difference between a type i and a type ii error is highly problematic  especially in 
 situations  so the default position is just believe all patterns are real all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind  
 and so i think that we evolved there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines our
  find meaningful patterns
 and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that i 'll come back to so for example what do you see here  
 it 's a horse head that 's right it looks like a horse it must be a horse  that 's a pattern 
 and is it really a horse  or is it more like a frog 
 see our pattern
  appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex it 's our little
 detection device there can be easily fooled and this is the problem for example what do you see here  
 yes of course it 's a cow  once i prime the brain it 's called cognitive priming once i prime the brain to see it  
 it pops back out again even without the pattern that i 've imposed on it and what do you see here  
 some people see a dalmatian dog  yes there it is and there 's the prime so when i go back
 without the prime your brain already has the model so you can see it again what do you see here  
 planet saturn yes that 's good how about here  
 just shout out anything you see 
 that 's a good audience chris because there 's nothing in this well allegedly there 's
  this is an experiment done by jennifer whitson
 at u t austin on corporate environments and whether
 feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns 
 that is almost everybody sees the planet saturn people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this which is allegedly patternless 
 in other words the
  find these patterns goes up when there 's a lack of control for example baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they 're batting  
 but not so much when they 're fielding 
 because fielders are successful ninety to ninety five percent of the time  the best batters fail seven out of ten times so their superstitions their patternicities are all associated with feelings of lack of control
 and so forth  what do you see in this particular one here  in this
  field anybody see an
 object there there actually is something here  
 but it 's degraded 
 while you 're thinking about that this was an experiment done by susan blackmore a psychologist in england who showed subjects this degraded image
 and then ran a correlation between their scores on an esp test how much did they believe in the paranormal
  and so forth and those who scored high on the esp scale tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images
 but incorrect patterns here is what
 you show subjects the fish is degraded
 twenty percent fifty percent and then the one i showed you seventy percent 
 a similar experiment was done by another [ swiss ] psychologist named peter brugger  who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right
  hemisphere via the left visual field than the left hemisphere 
 so if you present subjects the images such that it 's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left 
 then they 're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the the left hemisphere our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs so what we 're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens 
 brugger and his colleague christine mohr gave subjects
  's a drug as you know given for treating parkinson 's disease which is related to a decrease in dopamine l dopa increases dopamine 
 an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns
 than those that did not receive the dopamine so dopamine appears to be the drug
 associated with patternicity in fact neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior things like paranoia delusions and
  hallucinations these are patternicities they 're incorrect patterns they 're false positives they 're type i errors  and if you give them drugs that
 are dopamine antagonists  they go away that is you decrease the amount of dopamine and their tendency to see to see
 patterns like that decreases on the other hand amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists they increase the amount of dopamine so
  more likely to feel in a euphoric state creativity find more patterns in fact  i saw robin williams recently talk about how he
 he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine when he had that issue than now so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity dopamine i think changes
 our  signal to noise ratio that is how accurate we are in finding patterns if it 's too low
 you 're more likely to make too many type ii errors you miss the real patterns you don 't want to be too skeptical if you 're too skeptical you 'll miss the really interesting good ideas 
 just right  you 're creative and yet you don 't fall for too much baloney 
 too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you you think people are talking about you and if you go too far
  that 's just simply labeled as madness  it 's a distinction perhaps we might make between two nobel laureates richard feynman and john nash one sees
 maybe just the right number of patterns to win a nobel prize the other one also but maybe too many patterns and we then call that schizophrenia 
 so the signal to noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem and of course you all know exactly
 what this is right  
  and what pattern do you see here  
 again i 'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here causing you conflicting pattern detections you know of course this is via uno shoes these are sandals
  pretty sexy feet i must say
  maybe a little photoshopped  and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip flop back and forth it turns out what you 're thinking about a lot influences what
  and you see the lamp here i know because the lights on here  
 of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we 're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this in this particular ambiguous figure is of course the dolphins right 
 you see a dolphin here  
 and there 's a dolphin  and there 's a dolphin
  if we can give you conflicting data again your acc is going to be going into hyperdrive if you look down here it 's fine if you look up here then you get conflicting data  
 and then we have to flip the image for you to see that it 's a set up 
 the impossible crate illusion it 's easy to fool the brain
  come on shermer anybody can do that in a psych one hundred and one text with an
 illusion like that well here 's the late great jerry andrus ' impossible crate illusion in 3d in which jerry is standing inside
 the impossible crate  
 and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal of course camera angle is everything the photographer is over there  and this board appears to overlap with this one and this one with that one and so on but even when i
  the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns 
 this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle in fact it 's the exact same picture side by side  
 so what you 're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one but with that one and so your brain is fooled yet again your pattern detection devices are fooled faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition
  software in our temporal lobes here 's some faces on the side of a rock i 'm
 actually not even sure if this is this might be photoshopped but anyway the point is still made 
 now which one of these looks odd to you in a quick reaction which one looks odd 
 the one on the left okay so i 'll rotate it so it 'll be the one on the right  and you are
  fairly famous illusion it was first done with margaret thatcher now they trade up the politicians every time well why is this happening well we know exactly where it happens in the temporal lobe right across sort of above your ear there 
 in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus  
 and there 's two types of cells that do this that record facial features either globally or specifically these large rapid firing cells first look at the general face
 so you recognize obama immediately and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth  
 especially when they 're upside down you 're engaging that general facial recognition software there 
 now i said back in our little
 thought experiment you 're a hominid walking on the plains of africa is it just the wind or a dangerous predator what 's the difference between those 
 well the wind is inanimate the dangerous predator is an intentional agent  and i call this process agenticity that is the tendency to infuse patterns
 with meaning
  intention and agency often
 invisible beings from the top down 
 this is an idea that we got from a fellow tedster here  dan dennett who talked about taking the intentional stance so it 's a type of that expanded to explain i think a lot of different things souls spirits ghosts 
 gods demons angels aliens intelligent designers government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents
 and control our lives i think it 's the basis of animism
 and polytheism
 and monotheism it 's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us more moral than us and the narratives always are that they 're coming here to save us and rescue us
 from on high  the intelligent designer 's always portrayed as this super intelligent moral being that comes down to design life even the idea that government can rescue us that 's no
  longer the wave of the future but that is i think a type of agenticity  projecting somebody up there big and powerful will come rescue us 
 and this is also i think the basis of conspiracy theories there 's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings 
 whether it 's the illuminati or the bilderbergers but this is a pattern detection problem isn 't it some patterns are real and some are not was jfk assassinated by
 a conspiracy or by a lone assassin well if you go there
  there 's people there on any given day like when i went there here showing me where the different shooters were my favorite one was he was in the manhole  and he popped out at the last second took that shot  
 but of course  lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy so we can 't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that because let 's face it some patterns are real some conspiracies really are true  
 explains a lot maybe and nine eleven
  a conspiracy theory it is a conspiracy we did a whole issue on it 
 nineteen members of al queda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy but that 's not what the nine eleven truthers think they think it was an inside job by the bush administration well 
 that 's a whole other lecture 
 you know how we know that nine eleven was not orchestrated by the bush administration because
  our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these because we can imagine in essence  continuing on 
 we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe you can produce a feeling of out of body experiences near death experiences  which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there 
 or you can do it through loss of consciousness by accelerating in a centrifuge
 you get a hypoxia or a lower oxygen and the brain then senses that
 there 's an out of body experience
 you can use which i did went out and did michael persinger 's god helmet that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves and you get a sense of out of body experience  
 so i 'm
 going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together
  it 's just a minute and a half it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief go ahead and roll it narrator 
 this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm woman we 're hoping we can use part of
 this in a national commercial right and this is test on some lip balms that we have over here  and these are our models who
 kissing our models
  i 'm going to be looking for in this test is
