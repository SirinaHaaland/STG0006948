  i have eighteen minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years all right 
 we all have come from a long way here in africa  and converged in this region of africa
 which is a place where ninety percent of our evolutionary
 process took place  and i say that not because i am african but it 's in africa that you find the earliest evidence for
 human ancestors 
 upright walking traces  even the first technologies in the form of stone tools  so we all are africans and welcome home 
 all right
  i 'm a paleoanthropologist and my job is to define man 's place in nature
 and explore what makes us human and today i will use selam the earliest child ever discovered to tell you a story of all of us 
 selam is our most complete skeleton of a three year old girl who lived and died three point three million years ago  
 she belongs to the species known as australopithecus
  you don 't need to remember that that 's the lucy species and was found by my research team
 in december of two thousand in an area called dikika it 's in the northeastern part of ethiopia  and selam means peace in many ethiopian languages we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and
 in the planet  and the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of
  i think 
 after i was invited by ted i did some digging because that 's what we do to know about my host you don 't just jump into an invitation  and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools two point six million years ago 
 first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are thirty five thousand years old and evidence for first design comes seventy five thousand years old beads  
 and
 you can do the same with your genes and
  track them back in time and dna analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago
 and that these two species
 share over ninety eight percent of the same genetic material  i think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry 
  dna analysis informs us only about the beginning
 and the end
  telling us nothing about what happened in the middle so for us paleoanthropologists 
 our job is to find the hard evidence the fossil evidence to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development 
 because it 's only when you do that that you can talk about
  it 's only when you do that [ that ] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times  and how those
 likes and looks and behaviors changed through time 
 that then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today  
 but finding the hard evidence is a very
  endeavor it 's a
 systematic and scientific approach which takes you to places that are remote  hot  hostile and often with no access 
 just to give you an example when i went to dikika where selam was found in ' ninety nine
 and it 's about five hundred kilometers from addis ababa  the capital of ethiopia  
 it took us
 only seven hours to do the first four hundred
  seventy kilometers of the five hundred but took four solid hours to do the last only thirty kilometers 
 with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks i made my way i was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot 
 when you get there this is what you see and it 's the vastness of the place which makes you
  helpless and vulnerable and
 once you make it there  the big question is where to start 
 and you find nothing for years and years when i go to places like this which are paleontological sites it 's like
 going to a game park an extinct game park  but
 what you find are not the human remains such as selam and lucy on a
  but you could ask how could these large mammals live in this desert environment of course they cannot but i 'm telling you already that
 the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today 
 a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this 
 anyway once we made it
  a game park as i said an extinct game park  and our ancestors lived in that game park but were just the minorities they were not as successful and as widespread as
 the homo sapiens that we are to tell you just an example an anecdote about their rarity i was going to this place every year
 and would do fieldwork here and the assistants of course helped me do the surveys
  one of my assistants who never went to school said to me listen zeray you either don 't know what you 're looking for or you 're looking in the wrong place he said 
 and i said why because there were elephants and lions and the people were scared and went somewhere else let 's go somewhere else 
 well  he was very tired and it 's really tiring  it was then after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found selam and you see
  the face here covered by sandstone 
 and here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block because she was buried by a river 
 what you have here seems to be nothing but
 contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human
  this is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology an amazing piece of our long long history 
 there were these three people and me  and i am taking the pictures that 's why i am not in 
 how would you feel if you were me you have something extraordinary in your hand  but you are in the middle of nowhere  the feeling i had was a deep and
 quiet happiness and excitement
  of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility of making sure everything is safe 
 here is a close up of the fossil 
 after five years of cleaning preparation and description 
 which was very long as i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block i just showed you in the previous slide  it took five years in a way this was like the second birth for the child after three point three million years  but
 the labor was very long  and here
 is full scale it 's a tiny bone 
 and in the middle is the minister of ethiopian tourism who came to visit the national museum of ethiopia while i was working there  and you see me worried and trying to protect my child  
 because you don 't leave anyone with this kind of child even a minister 
 so then  once you 've done
  then it was possible to compare we were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs the foot and some features
 clearly showed that she walked upright and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity but in addition if you
  the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little george bush here you see that you have vertical forehead  and you see that in humans  
 because of the development of the pre frontal cortex it 's called you don 't see that in chimpanzees  
 and
 you don 't see this very projecting canine so she belongs to our family tree but within that of course you do detailed analysis and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species known as australopithecus afarensis
 the next exciting question is girl or boy  and how old was she when she died 
 you can determine the the sex of the individual based on
 the size of the teeth  how you know in primates there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females 
  but to do that you need the permanent dentition which you don 't see here  because what you have here are the baby teeth  
 but using the ct scanning technology which is normally used for medical purposes you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still growing adult teeth here  
 so when you measure those teeth  it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with
  and to know how old she was when she died what you do is you do an informed estimate  and you say how much time would be required
 to form this amount of teeth and the answer was three so this girl
 died when she was about three three point three million years ago  so with all that information the big question is what do we actually
 what does she tell us to answer this question we can phrase another question what do we
  actually know about our ancestors we want to know how they looked like how they behaved how they walked around and how they lived and grew up 
 and among the answers that
 you can
 get from this skeleton are included first this
 skeleton documents for the first time how infants looked over three million years ago and second
 she tells us that she walked upright  but had some adaptation for tree climbing and more interesting however is the brain in this child was still growing at age three  if you have a still growing brain it 's a human behavior 
 in chimps by age three  
 the brain is formed over ninety percent  
 that 's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth faster faster than us anyway
  in humans we continue to grow our brains that 's why we need care from our parents  
 but that care means also you learn you spend more time with your parents  and that 's very characteristic of humans and it 's called childhood which is this extended dependence of human children on their on their family or parents  
 so 
 the still growing brain in this individual
 tells us that childhood  which requires
  an incredible
 social organization a very complex social organization  emerged over three million years ago  
 so  by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history selam
 unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human  but not
  everything was human  and i will give you a very exciting example 
 this is called the hyoid bone it 's a bone which is right here it supports your tongue from behind 
 it 's in a way your voice box it determines the determines the type of voice you produce  
 it was not known in the fossil record  and we have it in this skeleton 
 when we did the analysis of this bone  it was clear that it
  if you were there three point three million years ago to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human 
 maybe you 're wondering so you see this ape
 feature human feature ape feature what does that tell us you know 
 that is very exciting for us because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively and that evolution is in the making 
 to summarize the significance of this fossil
 we can say the following up to now the knowledge that we had about our our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals
 because the fossils the baby fossils were missing they don 't preserve well as you know  so the knowledge that we had about our ancestors on how 
 they looked like how they behaved was kind of biased toward adults
 imagine
 somebody coming from mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth  and you hide all the babies  the children 
 and he goes back and reports can you imagine how much biased his
 report would be that 's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children  so i think the new fossil fixes this problem
 so i think the most important question at the end is 
 what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general 
 of course in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human you know the many human ancestors
 that have existed over the past six million years and there are more than ten
  did not have the knowledge the technology and sophistications that we homo sapiens have today  but
 if this species ancient species would travel in time and see us today  they would very much be very proud of
 their legacy  
 because they became the ancestors of the most successful species
  in the universe and they were probably not aware of this future legacy but they did great now the question is we homo sapiens today
 are in a position to decide about the future of
 our planet  possibly more so the question is are we up to the challenge  
 and can we really do better than these primitive small brained ancestors 
 among the most pressing
 challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic
 problems of africa  needless to list them here and there are more competent people to talk about this 
 still in my opinion we have two choices one is
 to continue to see a poor ill crying africa
  carrying guns that depends on other people forever or
 to promote
 an africa which is confident peaceful independent but cognizant of its huge problems and
 great values at the same time i am for the second option  and i 'm sure many of you are and the key
 is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa
 that 's because
 we africans concentrate i am from ethiopia by the way we concentrate too much on how we are seen from
 elsewhere or from outside  i think it 's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves
  that 's what i call positive african attitude so finally i would like to say so let 's help africa
 walk upright and forward then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species  thank you
