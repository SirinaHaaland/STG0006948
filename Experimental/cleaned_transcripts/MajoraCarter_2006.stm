  if you 're here today and i 'm very happy that you are
 you 've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves  however  when we 're not at ted  we are often told that a real
  policy agenda is just not feasible especially in large urban areas like new york city  
 and that 's because most people with decision making powers in both the public and the private sector 
 really don 't feel as though they 're in danger  
 the reason why i 'm here today in part is because of a dog
 an abandoned puppy i found back in the rain back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight she turned out to be a much bigger dog than i 'd anticipated 
 when she came into my life  we were fighting against a huge waste facility
  for the east river waterfront
 despite the fact that our small part of new york city already handled more than forty percent of the entire city 's commercial waste a sewage treatment pelletizing plant a sewage sludge plant 
 four power plants the world 's largest food distribution center as well as other industries that bring more than sixty thousand diesel truck diesel truck trips to the area each week 
 the area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people
 so when i was contacted by the parks department about a $ ten thousand seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects i thought they were really well meaning but a bit naive 
 i 'd lived in this area all my life  and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities that i mentioned earlier then
 while jogging with my dog one morning  she
 pulled me into what i thought was just another illegal dump
 there were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that i won 't mention here  but she kept dragging me and lo and behold at the end of that lot was the river 
 i knew that this forgotten little street end abandoned like the dog that brought me there was worth saving and i knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community led revitalization of the new south bronx and just like my new dog it was an idea that got
 bigger than i 'd imagined  we garnered much support along the way and the hunts point riverside park became the first waterfront park that the south bronx had had in more than sixty years we leveraged that $ ten thousand seed grant more than three hundred times into a $ three million park 
 and in the fall i 'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved
 applause but those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine  we feel the problems right now and have for some time 
 environmental justice for those of you who may not be familiar with the term goes something like this 
 no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other
  unfortunately  race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff like parks and trees and where one might find the bad stuff like power plants and waste facilities 
 as a black person in america i am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health i am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility which i do 
  decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity diabetes and asthma  why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood 
 our twenty seven percent obesity rate is high even for this country and diabetes comes with it one out of four south bronx children has asthma our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average these impacts
  are coming everyone 's way  and we all pay dearly for solid waste costs health problems associated with pollution and more odiously  the cost of imprisoning our young black and latino men 
 who possess untold amounts of untapped potential fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line twenty five percent of us are unemployed low income citizens often use
 emergency room visits as primary care this comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits poor people are not only still poor they are still unhealthy
  fortunately there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won 't compromise the lives of low income communities of color in the short term  and won 't destroy us all in the long term  none of us 
  want that and we all have that in common so what else do we have in common well first of all we 're all incredibly good looking 
 graduated high school college post graduate degrees traveled to interesting places  didn 't have kids in your early teens financially stable
  never been imprisoned  ok good 
 but besides being a black woman  i am different from most of you in some other ways i watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down 
 my big brother lenny fought in vietnam only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home 
  i grew up with a crack house across the street  
 yeah  i 'm a poor black child from the ghetto  these things make me different from you  but the things we have in common
 set me apart from most of the people in my community and i am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other 
 so how did things get so different for us
  my dad a pullman porter son of a slave bought a house in the hunts point section of the south bronx and a few years later he married my mom at the time the community was a mostly white working class
  neighborhood my dad was not alone  and as others like him pursued their own version of the american dream white flight became common in the south bronx and in many cities around the country
  to any sort of investment many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions
 dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding 
 hunts point was formerly a walk to work community  but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to 
 a national highway construction boom was added to our problems 
 in new york state robert moses spearheaded an aggressive
  of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in westchester county to
 to go to manhattan the south bronx which lies in between did not stand a chance residents were often given less than a month 's notice before their buildings were razed six hundred thousand people 
  were displaced the common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx 
  that nothing good is going to come from your community that it 's bad and ugly how could it not reflect on you 
 so now my family 's property was worthless  save for that it was our home and all we had and luckily for me  
 that home and the love inside of it along with help from teachers mentors and friends along the way was enough
  why is this story important  because from a planning perspective economic degradation begets environmental degradation which begets social degradation  
 the disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come antiquated zoning and land use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood 
 are these factors taken into consideration
  policy is decided what costs are associated with these decisions and who pays who profits does anything justify
 what the local community goes through  this was planning in quotes that did not have our best interests in mind  
 once we realized that we decided it was time to do our own planning that small park i told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the south bronx  i wrote a one and a quarter million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated
  paths physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety the placement of the waste and other facilities which if done properly don 't compromise a community 's
 quality of life they provide opportunities to be more physically active as well as local economic development think bike shops juice stands we secured twenty million dollars to build first phase projects this is lafayette avenue
 and that 's redesigned by mathews nielsen landscape architects
  and once this path is constructed it 'll connect the south bronx with more than four hundred acres of randall 's island park 
 right now we 're separated by about twenty five feet of water but this link will change that as we nurture the natural environment its abundance will give us back even more we run a project called the bronx 
 [ environmental ] stewardship training which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these
  by little we 're seeding the area with green collar jobs and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment 
 the sheridan expressway is an underutilized relic of the robert moses era  built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it even during rush hour it goes virtually unused  
 the community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway
  we have the opportunity now to bring together all
  stakeholders to re envision how this twenty eight acres can be better utilized for parkland  affordable housing and local economic development we also built new york city 's first green and cool roof demonstration project
 on top of our offices cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don 't absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere green roofs are soil and living plants 
 both can be used instead of petroleum based roofing materials that absorb heat
  contribute to urban heat island effect and degrade under the sun  which we in turn breathe 
 green roofs also retain up to seventy five percent of rainfall so they reduce a city 's need to fund costly end of pipe solutions which incidentally are often located in environmental justice communities like mine
  and they provide habitats for our little friends [ butterfly ]
  demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the south bronx [ green is the new black ] 
 i like that too 
 anyway  i know chris told us not to do pitches up here but since i have all of your attention  we need investors end of pitch it 's better to ask
  prior to katrina the south bronx and new orleans ' ninth ward had a lot in common both were largely populated by poor people of color both hotbeds of cultural innovation think hip hop and jazz both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one
  still more in common we 're at best ignored and maligned and abused at worst by negligent regulatory agencies pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability 
 neither the destruction of the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable  
 but we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out we are more than simply national symbols of urban blight
 or problems to be solved by
 empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone now will we let the gulf coast languish for a decade or two like the south bronx did or will we take
 proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine now listen i do not expect individuals corporations or government to make the world a better place
  this presentation today only represents some of what i 've been through  like a tiny little bit you 've no clue but i 'll tell you later if you want to know but
 i know it 's the bottom line or one 's perception of it that motivates people in the end i 'm interested in what i like to call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce 
 developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned  the developers
  government and the community where these projects go up at present that 's not happening in new york city  and we are operating with a
 comprehensive urban planning deficit 
 a parade of government subsidies is going to propose big box and stadium developments in the south bronx  but there is scant coordination between city agencies agencies on how to deal with the
  effects of increased traffic pollution solid waste and the impacts on open space and their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it 's not even funny 
 because on top of that the world 's richest sports team is replacing the house that ruth built by destroying
  spaces  yet zip in terms of mass public transit now what 's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy 
 community versus incorporating structural
 sustainable changes my agency is working closely with columbia university and others to shine a light on these issues 
 now let 's get this straight  i am not anti development ours is a city not a wilderness
  preserve and i 've embraced my inner capitalist and but i don 't have you
 probably all have and if you haven 't you need to 
 so i don 't have a problem with developers making money there 's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable
  fellow tedsters bill mcdonough and amory lovins both heroes of mine by the way
 have shown that you can actually do that 
 i do have a problem with developments that  hyper exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit  that it continues is a shame upon us all because we are all responsible for the future 
  that we create but one of the things i do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities this is my version of globalization let 's take
  bogota  poor latino surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking a reputation not unlike that of the south bronx
  however this city was blessed  in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named enrique  pealosa 
 he looked at the demographics few bogotanos own cars  yet a huge portion of the city 's resources was dedicated to serving them if you 're a mayor you can do something about that
  his administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streets  expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes created public plazas
  created one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire world for his brilliant efforts he was nearly impeached 
 but
 as people
 began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting
  their day to day lives incredible things happened people stopped littering  crime rates dropped because the streets were alive with people 
 his administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time and on a third world budget at that we have no excuse in this country i 'm sorry  but the bottom line is their people first agenda was not meant
  who could actually afford cars  but rather to provide opportunities for all bogotanos to participate in the city 's resurgence 
 that development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the u s but bogota 's example has the power to change that 
 you however are blessed with the gift of influence that 's why you 're here and why you value the
  we exchange use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere  don 't just talk about it at ted 
 this is a nationwide policy agenda i 'm trying to build  and as you all know  politics are personal 
 help me make green the new black 
 help me make sustainability sexy make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations help me fight for environmental and economic justice support investments with a
  help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere oh good glad i have
 a little more time
  listen when i spoke to mr gore the other day after breakfast  i asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included
 in his new marketing
  his response was a grant program i don 't think he understood that i wasn 't asking for funding 
 i was making him an offer what troubled me
 was that this top down approach is still around now
 don 't get me wrong we need money
 laughter but grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision making process 
 of the ninety percent of the energy that mr gore reminded us that we waste every day don 't add wasting our energy intelligence and 
  experience to that count
  from so far
 to meet you like this please don 't waste me 
 by working together we can become one of those small
 rapidly growing groups of of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world 
 we might have come
  this conference from very very different stations in life  but believe me we all share one incredibly powerful thing  
 we have nothing to lose and everything to gain
