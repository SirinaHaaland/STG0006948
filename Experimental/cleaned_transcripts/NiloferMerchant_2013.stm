  what you 're doing right now  at this very moment is killing you more than cars or the internet
 or even that little mobile device we keep talking about the technology you 're using the most almost every day is this
  your tush  
 nowadays people are sitting nine point three hours a day which is more than we 're sleeping at seven point seven hours 
 sitting is so incredibly prevalent we don 't even question how much we 're doing it and because
 everyone else is doing it it doesn 't even occur to us that it 's not okay 
 in that way sitting has become the smoking of our generation 
 of course there 's
  health consequences to this  scary ones  besides the waist things like
 breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical [ activity ] 
 ten percent in fact on both of those six percent for heart disease seven percent for type two diabetes  which is what my father died of 
 now any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more but if you 're anything like
  me it won 't  
 what did get me moving was a social interaction 
 someone invited me to a meeting  but couldn 't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting and said i have to walk my dogs tomorrow could you come then it seemed
 kind of odd to do  and actually that first meeting i remember thinking i have to be the one to ask the next question
  i knew i was going to huff
 and puff during this conversation 
 and yet i 've taken that idea and made it my own  
 so instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent lit conference room meetings i ask people to go on a walking meeting 
 to the tune of twenty to thirty miles a week 
 it 's changed my life 
 but before that  what actually happened was i used to think about it as you could take care of your health or you could take care of obligations
 and one always came at the cost of the other  
 so now  several hundred of these walking meetings later  i 've learned a few things first there 's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out of the box thinking  
 whether it 's nature or the exercise itself it certainly works 
 and second and probably the more reflective one is just about how much each of us can
  hold problems in opposition
 when they 're really not that way 
 and if we 're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently whether it 's in governance or business or environmental issues  job creation 
 maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true  because it was when that happened with this
  that things became doable and sustainable and viable so i started this talk talking about the tush so i 'll end with the bottom line which is 
 walk and talk  
 walk the talk you 'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking  and in the way that you do you 'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas
