  here 's my special mission for this talk  i 'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room by
  seven and a half minutes literally you will live seven and a half minutes longer than you would have otherwise just because you watched this talk 
 some of you are looking a little bit skeptical that 's okay because check it out i have math to prove that it is possible it won
 't make much sense now i 'll explain it all later just pay attention to the number at the bottom + seven point six eight two four five eight three seven minutes that will
  be my gift to you
 if i 'm successful in my mission now  you have a secret mission too 
 your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes and i think you should do something unusual with them because these are bonus minutes you weren 't going to have them anyway  
 now  because i 'm a game designer you might be thinking to yourself i know what she wants us to do with those minutes she wants
  us to spend them playing games now this is a totally reasonable assumption given that i have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games for example in my first 
  ted talk  i did propose that we should spend twenty one billion hours a week as a planet playing video games now twenty one billion hours it 's a lot of
  it 's so much time in fact that the number one unsolicited comment that i have heard from people all over the world since i gave that talk is this 
 jane games are great and all but on your deathbed are you really going to wish you spent more time playing angry birds 
 laughter this idea is so pervasive that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret that i hear it literally everywhere i go
  for example true story just a few weeks ago this cab driver upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developers ' conference turned around and said and i quote 
 i hate games  waste of life  imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time 
 now i want to take this problem seriously
 i want games to be a force for good in the world i
  want gamers to regret the time they spent playing time that i encouraged them to spend  so i have been thinking about this question a lot lately 
 when we 're on our deathbeds will we regret the time we spent playing games  
 now this may surprise you but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question it 's true 
 hospice workers the people who take care of us at the end of our lives
  recently issued a report
 on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds  and that 's what i want to share with you today
 the top five regrets of the dying  number one  
 i wish i hadn 't worked so hard  
 number two  i wish i had stayed in touch with my friends number three i wish
 i had let myself be happier  
 number four  i wish i 'd had the courage to express my true self  
 and number five  i wish i 'd lived a life true to my dreams  instead of what others expected of me 
 now as far as i
  no one ever told one of the hospice workers i wish i 'd spent more time playing video games 
 but when i hear these top five regrets of the dying  i can 't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill for example
  i wish i hadn 't worked so hard for many people this means i wish i 'd spent more time with my family with my kids when they were growing up well we know that playing games together has tremendous family
  a recent study from brigham young university school of family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real life relationships with them 
 i wish i 'd stayed in touch with my friends hundreds of millions of people use social games like farmville or words with friends to stay in daily contact with real life friends and family 
 a recent study from
  they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from if we weren 't playing games together 
 i wish i 'd let myself be happier well here i can 't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at east carolina university that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical
  anxiety and depression 
 just thirty minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and  long term increases in happiness 
 i wish i 'd had the courage to express my true self well avatars are a way to express
 our true selves our most heroic idealized version of who we might become you can see that in this alter ego portrait by
  robbie cooper of a gamer with his avatar 
 and stanford university has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life 
  making us more courageous more ambitious more committed to our goals 
  this yet i 'm not sure  so i 've left a super mario question mark we 're going to come back to this one  but in the meantime 
 perhaps you 're wondering who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets and it 's true i 've
 never worked in a hospice i 've never been on my deathbed
  i did spend three months in bed wanting to die  really wanting to die now let me tell you that story  
 it started two years ago when i hit my head and got a concussion the concussion didn 't heal properly and after thirty days i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches nausea vertigo memory loss mental fog 
 my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain i had to rest it so i had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms for me
  that meant no reading no writing no video games no work or email no running no alcohol no caffeine in other words and i think you see where this is going
 no reason to live 
 of course it 's meant to be funny  but in all seriousness  suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries 
 it happens to one in three  and it happened to me 
 my brain started telling me
 you want to die it said you 're never going to get better 
 it said the pain will never end and these voices became so persistent and so persuasive
 that i started to legitimately fear for my life  which
 is the time that i said to myself after thirty four days and i will never forget this moment
 i said 
 i am either going to kill myself or i 'm going to turn this into a game now why a game i knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade 
 that when we play a game and this is in the scientific literature we tackle tough challenges with more creativity more determination more optimism and we 're more likely to reach out to others for help i wanted to bring these gamer traits to my
 so i created a role playing recovery game called jane the concussion slayer  now this became my new secret identity  and the first thing i did as a slayer was call my twin 
  sister i have an identical twin sister named kelly and tell her i 'm playing a game to heal my brain and i want you to play with me 
 my husband kiyash joined next and together we identified and battled the bad guys now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process things like bright lights and crowded spaces 
 we also collected and activated power ups this was anything i could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good just a little bit productive  things like cuddling my dog
  for ten minutes  or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once now the game was that simple  adopt a secret identity  recruit your allies  battle the bad guys  activate the power ups 
 but even with a game so simple  within just a couple days of starting to play  
 that fog of depression and anxiety
  it just vanished it felt like a miracle now it wasn 't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms that lasted for more than a year 
 and it was the hardest year of my life by far  but even when i still had the symptoms even while i was still in pain  
 i stopped suffering  
 now what happened next with the game surprised me  i put up some blog posts and videos online explaining how to play but not everybody has a concussion obviously not everyone wants to be the slayer
  renamed the game superbetter 
 and soon i started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity  recruiting their own allies and they were getting super better 
 facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain depression and crohn 's disease 
 even people were playing it for terminal
  and i could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me  they talked about feeling stronger and braver 
 they talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family  
 and they even talked about feeling happier even though they were in pain  even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives  now at the
  i 'm thinking to myself 
 what is going on here i mean how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious and in some cases 
  if it hadn 't worked for me  there 's no way i would have believed it was possible well it turns out there 's some science here too 
 some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event 
 and that 's what was happening to us the game was helping us experience what scientists call
 growth which is not something we usually hear about we usually hear about post traumatic stress disorder but scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn 't doom us to suffer 
  indefinitely  instead we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives  here are the top five things
  i 'm not afraid to do what makes me happy i feel closer to my friends and family i understand myself better i know who i really am now 
 i have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life 
 i 'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams now does this sound familiar it should because the top five traits of post traumatic growth are essentially the direct
  opposite of the top five regrets of the dying  now this is interesting right  it seems that somehow a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead 
  a life with fewer regrets but how does it work how do you get from trauma to growth  or better yet is there a way to get all the benefits of post traumatic growth without the trauma without having to hit your head in the first place
  i wanted to understand the phenomenon better  so i devoured the scientific literature and here 's what i learned 
 there are four kinds of strength  or resilience  that contribute to post traumatic growth and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do 
 every day to build up these four kinds of resilience and you don 't need a trauma to do it i could tell you what these four types of strength are but i 'd rather you experience them
  firsthand i 'd rather we all start building them up together right now here 's what we 're going to do we 'll play a quick game together this is where you earn the seven and a half minutes of bonus life that i promised you earlier 
 all you have to do is successfully complete the first four superbetter quests  and i feel like you can do it i have confidence in you so everybody ready
  this is your first quest  here we go  
 pick one  stand up and take three steps or make your hands into fists  raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds go all right 
 i like the people doing both you are overachievers very good 
 well done everyone that is worth + one physical resilience which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster we know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still
 that 's all it takes every single second that you are not sitting still you are actively improving the health of your heart and your lungs and brains  
 everybody ready for your next quest  
 i want you to snap your fingers exactly fifty times or count backwards from one hundred by seven like this one hundred
  don 't let the people counting down from one hundred interfere with your counting to fifty 
 wow that 's the first time i 've ever seen that bonus physical resilience well done everyone 
 now that 's worth + one mental resilience which means you have more mental focus more discipline
  determination and willpower we know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle  it gets stronger the more you exercise it so tackling a tiny 
 challenge without giving up even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly fifty times or counting backwards from one hundred by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost 
  your willpower so good job quest number three  pick one because of the room fate 's really determined this for you but here are the two options  
 if you 're outside find a window and look in  
 or do a quick youtube or google image search for baby [ your favorite animal ] do it on your phones or just shout out some baby animals and i 'll put them on the screen so what do we want to see 
 sloth giraffe elephant  snake okay let 's see what we got  baby dolphin
  what we 're just feeling there is plus one emotional resilience  which means you have the ability to provoke powerful positive emotions like curiosity or love which we feel looking at baby animals 
 when you need them most here 's a secret from the scientific literature for you if you can manage to experience three positive
  emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour a day a week  you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle 
 any problem you 're facing and this is called the three to one positive emotion ratio it 's my favorite superbetter trick so keep it up 
  one social resilience which means you actually get more strength from your friends
  your neighbors your family your community now a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude touch is even better here 's one more secret for you shaking someone 's hand for six seconds 
 dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream now that 's the trust hormone 
  you have successfully completed your four quests let 's see if i 've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life now i get to share one more little bit of science with you 
 it turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience
 physical mental emotional and social live ten years longer than everyone else so this is true  if you are regularly achieving the three to one positive emotion ratio  if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time
  if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day  
 if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower  you will live ten years longer than everyone else and here 's where that math i showed you earlier comes in so the average life expectancy 
  in the u s and the u k is seventy eight point one years  but we know from more than one thousand peer reviewed scientific studies that you can add ten years of life by boosting your four types of resilience  so every single year
  that you are boosting your four types of resilience you 're actually earning 128 more years of life or forty six more days of life 
  two hundred and ninety eight more minutes of life which means every single day you are earning one hundred and eighty four minutes of life or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience like we just did together you are earning seven point six eight two four five eight three
  you still have your special mission your secret mission how are you going to spend these minutes of bonus life  well here 's my suggestion 
 these seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie 's wishes you can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes pretty clever right so if you spend
 these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy  or that gets you physically active or puts you in touch with someone you care about 
  or even just tackling a tiny challenge you 're going to boost your resilience  so you 're going to earn more minutes and the good news is you can keep going like that every hour of
  every day of your life  all the way to your deathbed which will now be ten years later than it would have otherwise 
 and when you get there more than likely  
 you will not have any of those top five regrets  because you will have built up the strength and resilience
 to lead a life truer to your dreams  and with ten extra years  you might even have enough time to play a few more games  thank you
