  i would like to talk
 today about what i think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it my own interest in this subject
  my passion for it  began rather accidentally  i had bought
 a copy of this book the universe and dr einstein a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle 
 a few years after that in bangalore  i was finding it hard to fall asleep one night  and i picked up this book thinking it would put me to sleep in ten minutes 
 and as it happened i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot
  and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at
 the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do  
 and that feeling hasn 't left me yet that feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career from being a software engineer
 to become a science writer so that i could partake in the joy of science  and also the joy of communicating
  it to others  and that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts to go literally to the ends of the earth
 to see telescopes detectors instruments that people are building or have built 
 in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail
 so it it took me from places like chile the atacama desert in chile to siberia to underground mines in the japanese alps in northern america 
 all the way to antarctica and even to
  the south pole  and today i would like to share with you some images some stories of these trips
  i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who
 are putting literally at times their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to
  understand this universe and i first begin with a pie chart and i promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation but 
 it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos all the theories in physics that we have today
 properly explain what is called normal matter the stuff that we 're all made of and that 's four percent of the universe  astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that
  there is something called dark matter in the universe which makes up twenty three percent of the universe and something called dark energy which permeates the fabric of space time that makes up another  seventy three percent 
  so if you look at this pie chart ninety six percent of the universe at this point in our exploration of it is unknown or not well understood  and most of the experiments telescopes that i went to see are in some way addressing this question these two twin
  mysteries of dark matter and dark energy  i will take you first to an underground mine in northern minnesota where people are looking for something called
 dark matter and the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors 
 and the reason why they have to go underground is that if you did this experiment on the surface of the earth  the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by
  things like cosmic rays  ambient radio activity even our own bodies you might not believe it but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment so they go deep inside 
  mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector  
  and this is actually
 you can barely see it and the reason for that is it 's entirely dark in there this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners
 who left this mine in one thousand nine hundred and sixty and physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s 
 and the miners in the early part of the last century worked  literally in candlelight  and today you would see this inside the mine half a mile underground this is one of the largest underground labs in
  looking for dark matter 
 there is another way to search for dark matter which is indirectly  if dark matter exists in our universe  in our galaxy 
 then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about one of them being neutrinos 
 and neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules when a neutrino hits a water molecule
 it emits a kind of blue light a flash of blue light
 and by looking for this blue light you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then indirectly something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino 
 but you need very very large volumes of water in order to do this you need something like tens of megatons of water almost a gigaton of water in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino 
 and where in the world would you find such water well the russians have
 a tank in their own backyard  this is lake baikal it is the largest lake in the world it 's eight hundred km long 
 it 's about forty to fifty km wide in most places and one to two kilometers deep  and what the russians are doing is they 're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they
 can watch for these flashes of blue light  and this is the scene that greeted me when i landed there this is lake baikal in the peak of the siberian winter the lake is entirely frozen 
 and the
 line of black dots that you see in the background that 's the ice camp where the physicists are working the reason why they have to work in winter is because they don 't have the money to work in summer and spring 
 which if they did that they would need ships and submersibles to do their work  so they wait until winter the lake
  is completely frozen over and they use this meter thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work  so this is the russians working
 on the ice in the peak of the siberian winter they have to drill holes in the ice  dive down into the water cold cold water to get hold of the instrument  bring it up do any
  and maintenance that they need to do 
 put it back and get out before the ice melts because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it 's full of cracks  and you have to imagine there 's an entire sea like lake underneath moving  
 i still don 't understand this one russian man working in his
 bare chest
  but that tells you how hard he was working  and these people a handful of people have been working for twenty years looking for particles that may or may not exist 
 and they have dedicated their lives to it
 and
 just to give you an idea  they have spent twenty million over twenty years it 's very harsh conditions they work on a shoestring budget  
 the toilets there are literally holes in the ground
 covered
 with a wooden shack and it 's that basic  but they do this every year from siberia to the atacama desert in chile to see something called the very large telescope the very large telescope
  is one of these things that astronomers do they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively i can tell you for a fact that the next one that they 're planning is called the extremely large telescope 
 laughter and you wouldn 't believe it but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope 
 but nonetheless it 's an extraordinary piece of engineering
  these are four eight point two meter telescopes and these telescopes  among other things they 're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time  and 
 the more you understand that the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with 
 as regards this telescope is the mirror  each mirror there are four of them is made of a single piece of glass a monolithic piece of
 that has been ground down and polished to to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is [ to ] imagine a city like paris with all its buildings and 
  the eiffel tower  if you grind down paris to that kind of accuracy you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high  
  same the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert the dry air is really good for telescopes and 
  also the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about three hundred days of clear skies  
 amazing experiments some of the most extreme experiments are being done in antarctica i was there to view something called a long duration balloon flight
 which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper
 atmosphere the upper stratosphere forty km up  and that 's where they do their experiments and then the balloon the payload
  is brought down so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica that 's an american c 17 cargo plane that flew us from new zealand to mcmurdo in antarctica 
 and here we are about to board our bus  and i don 't know if you can read the lettering  but it says ivan the terribus 
 and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole  
 because it 's so cold  the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there it 's an extraordinary place this is mcmurdo 
  itself about a thousand people work here in summer and about two hundred in winter when it 's completely dark for six months 
  of instrument  this is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the 
 to an altitude of forty km what i want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight  so you 're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons
 all the way to an altitude of forty km and the engineers the technicians the physicists have all got to assemble on the ross ice shelf
 't go into the reasons why but it 's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches 
 except for the weather the weather as you can imagine this is summer and you 're standing on two hundred ft of ice and there 's a volcano behind which has glaciers at the very top  
 and
 what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon the
 fabric parachute and everything on the ice and then fill it up with helium and that process takes about two hours  and the weather can
  change as they 're putting together this whole assembly 
 for instance here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind  which is eventually going to be filled up with helium  those two trucks you see at the very end
 carry twelve tanks each of compressed helium
  now  in case the weather changes before the launch they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to mcmurdo station  
 and
 this particular balloon because
  it has to launch two tons of weight is an extremely huge balloon 
 the fabric alone weighs two tons in order to minimize the weight it 's very thin it 's as thin as a sandwich wrapper  and if they have to pack it back they have to put it into boxes
 and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again except when they did
  it would have been done in texas here they can 't do it with the kind shoes they 're wearing so they have to take their shoes off get barefoot into the boxes in this cold  and do that kind of 
  work that 's the kind of dedication these people have here 's the balloon being filled up with helium  and you can see it 's a gorgeous sight here 's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload 
 end to end so the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left hand side and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there 's a piece of electronics and explosives
  being connected to a parachute and then the parachute is then connected to the payload 
 and remember all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold in  sub zero temperatures they 're wearing about fifteen kg of clothing and stuff but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that
  and i would like to share with you a launch
  finally like to leave you with two images  this is an observatory in the himalayas  in ladakh in india  and the thing i want you to look at here is the telescope on the right hand side 
  and on the far left there is a four hundred year old buddhist monastery  this is a close up of the buddhist monastery  and i was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has one is exploring the cosmos
 on the outside and the other one is exploring our interior being and both require silence of some sort  and what struck me was every place that i went to to see these telescopes 
 the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence whether it 's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever  and it was very obvious that if we destroy these silent places on earth we will be stuck on a planet without the
  ability to look outwards because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space  thank you
