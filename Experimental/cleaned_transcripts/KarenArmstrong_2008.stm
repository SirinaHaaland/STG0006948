  this is such an honor and it 's wonderful to
 be in the presence of
 an organization that is really making a difference in the world and i 'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today
 and i 'm also rather surprised  because when i look back on my life
 the last thing i ever wanted to do was 
 or be in any way involved in religion after i left my convent  i 'd finished with religion frankly
  i thought that was it and for thirteen years i kept clear of it i wanted to be an english literature professor  
 and
 i certainly didn 't even want to be a writer particularly  but then i suffered a series of career catastrophes one after the other
 and finally found myself in television 
  was doing
 some rather controversial religious programs 
 this went down very well in the u k 
 where religion is extremely unpopular  and so for once for the only time in my life  i was finally in the mainstream
  i got sent to jerusalem to make a
 film about early christianity and there for the first time  
 i encountered the other religious traditions judaism and islam 
 the sister religions of christianity and while i found i knew nothing about these faiths at all despite my own intensely
 religious background
  seen judaism only as a kind of prelude to christianity and i knew nothing about islam at all 
 but in that city that tortured city  where you see the
 three faiths jostling so uneasily together you also become aware of the profound connection between them and
 it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different
  light  and i found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me frankly
 in the days when i thought i 'd had it with religion i just found the whole thing absolutely incredible
  these doctrines seemed unproven
  studying other traditions i began to realize that belief which we make such a fuss about today
 is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west
 in about the
 to hold dear in the 17th century  it narrowed its focus for reasons that i 'm exploring in a book i 'm writing at the moment 
 to include to to mean
 an intellectual assent to a set of propositions a credo i believe it did not mean i accept certain
 creedal articles of faith
 i engage myself indeed some of the world traditions think
 very little of religious orthodoxy in the quran 
 religious opinion religious orthodoxy is dismissed as zanna
 self indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian
 if religion is not about believing things what is it about what i 've found across the board is that religion is about behaving differently  
 instead of deciding whether or not you believe in god  first you do something you behave in a committed way  and then you begin to understand
 the truths of religion
  religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action you only understand them when you put them into practice 
 now pride of place
 in this practice is given to compassion 
 and it is an arresting fact that right across the board in every single one of the major world faiths
  compassion the ability to feel with the other in the way we 've been thinking about this evening
 is not only the test of any true religiosity 
 it is also what will bring us into the presence of what jews christians and muslims call god or the divine 
 it is compassion says the buddha  which brings you to nirvana
  why because in compassion when we feel with the other we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there
  and
 once we get rid of ego then we 're ready to see the divine  and in particular every single one of the major
  world traditions has highlighted
 has said and put at the core of their tradition what 's become known as the golden rule  
 first propounded by confucius five centuries before christ 
 do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you that he said was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day and it was
 the golden rule would bring them to the transcendent
  value that he called ren
 which was a transcendent experience in itself
  and this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms too 
 there 's a famous story about the great rabbi hillel the older contemporary of jesus a pagan came to him and offered to convert to judaism
 if the rabbi could recite the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on
  one leg  
 hillel stood on one leg and said that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor that is the torah the rest is commentary  
 go and study it and
 go and study it was what he meant he said in your exegesis you must make it clear that every single verse of the torah is a commentary a gloss
 upon the golden rule the great rabbi meir said that any
 interpretation of scripture which led to hatred and disdain 
 or contempt of other people any people whatsoever was illegitimate  saint augustine made exactly the same point
  teaches nothing but charity  and we must not leave an interpretation of scripture until we have found a compassionate
 interpretation of it and this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts
 is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life 
 but now look at our world and we are living
  living in a world that is
 where religion has been hijacked  where terrorists cite quranic verses
 to justify their atrocities where instead of taking jesus ' words love your enemies
  we have the spectacle of christians endlessly judging other people  endlessly
 using scripture as as a way of arguing with other people putting other people down throughout the ages 
 religion has been used to oppress others  and this is because of human ego  human greed
  as a species for messing up wonderful things so the traditions also insisted
 and this is an important point i think that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group 
 your own nation your own 
  your own fellow countrymen you must have what one of the chinese sages called
  enemies  honor the stranger we formed you says the quran into tribes and nations
 so that you may know one another  and
 this again this universal outreach is getting subdued in the strident use of religion
  i 've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who when i say to them what i do for a living inform me
 that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history wrong 
 the causes of our present woes are political
  but make no mistake about it religion is a kind of fault line
 and when a conflict gets
 ingrained in a region 
 religion can get sucked in and become part of the problem our modernity has been exceedingly violent 
 between one thousand nine hundred and fourteen and 
 seventy million people died in europe alone as a result of armed conflict
  so many of our institutions even
 football which used to be a pleasant
 pastime now  causes riots where people even die  
 and it 's not surprising that religion too has been affected by this violent ethos there 's
  i think of religious illiteracy around people
 seem to think
  now equate religious faith with believing things 
 as though that we call religious people often believers as though that were the main thing that they do and very often
  secondary goals get pushed into the first place in place of compassion and the golden
  rule because the golden rule is difficult i sometimes when i 'm speaking to
 congregations about compassion i sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces
 because a lot of religious people prefer to be right
  that 's not the whole story since september the 11th when my work on islam
 suddenly propelled me into public life in a way that i 'd never imagined  
 i 've been able to sort of go all over the world 
 and finding  everywhere i go a yearning for change  
 i 've just come back from pakistan
  where literally thousands of people came to my lectures because they were yearning first of all to hear a friendly western voice  
 and especially the young people were coming
  and were asking me the young people were saying what can we do what can we do to change
  my hosts in pakistan said look don 't be too polite to us
 tell us where we 're going going wrong let 's talk together about where religion is failing 
 because
 it seems to me that with our current situation is so serious at the moment
 that any ideology that doesn 't promote a sense of global understanding
  and global appreciation
 of each other is failing the test of the time  and religion with its
 wide following  here in the united states people may be being religious in a different way as a report has just shown
 but they still want to be religious it 's only western europe that has retained its secularism
 which is now beginning to look rather endearingly  old fashioned but
 people want to be religious and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world which it can and should be
 because of the golden rule do not do to others what you would not have them do to you an ethos that should now be applied globally
  we should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves 
 and these whatever our wretched beliefs
 is a religious matter it 's a spiritual matter it 's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage
  and as i say there is a hunger for change out there  here in the united states i think you see it in this election campaign 
 a longing for change and people in in churches all over and mosques all over this continent
 after september the 11th coming together locally to create
 networks of understanding with the mosque with the synagogue saying
  speak to one another i think it 's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration
 and move toward appreciation of the other  i 'd there 's
 one story i 'd just like to mention  this comes from the iliad but it tells you what this spirituality should be you know the story
 the 10 year war between greece and troy  
 in one incident achilles the famous warrior of greece takes his troops out of the war 
 and the whole war effort suffers  and in the course of the ensuing muddle his beloved friend patroclus is killed
 and killed in single combat by one of the trojan princes hector  
 and achilles goes mad with grief and rage
  and revenge  and he he mutilates the body 
 kills
 hector  he mutilates his body and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family  which means that in greek ethos
 hector 's soul will wander
  and then one night priam king of troy an old man comes into the greek camp incognito makes his way to achilles ' tent
 to ask for the body of his son 
 and everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself  and achilles looks at him
 and thinks of his father  and he starts to weep  and priam looks at the man who has
  murdered so many of his sons  and he too starts to weep  and the sound of their weeping filled the house the greeks
 believed that weeping together created a bond between people  and then
 achilles takes the body of hector he hands it very tenderly to the father
  the two men look at each other  and see each other as divine 
 that is the ethos found too in all the religions it 's what is meant by
 overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies  
 and beginning to appreciate the other it 's of great importance that the word for
  otherness of our enemies which can give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is god  
 and now  here 's my wish i wish
 that you would help with the creation
  propagation
 of a charter for compassion 
 crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three abrahamic traditions of judaism christianity and islam  
 and based on the fundamental principle of the golden rule 
 we need to create
 a movement among all these people that
  i meet in my travels you probably meet  too who want to join up in some way and reclaim
 their faith which they feel as i say has been hijacked we need
 to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos  and to give guidelines this charter would not be a massive
  i 'd like to see it
 to give guidelines as to how to interpret the scriptures these texts that are being abused
  remember what the rabbis and what augustine said about how scripture should be governed by the principle of charity let 's get back to that and the idea too of
 jews christians and muslims these traditions now so often at loggerheads working together
 to create
  document which we hope will be signed by
 a thousand at least of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world 
 and you are the people i 'm just a solitary scholar despite the idea that i love a good time which i was rather amazed to see coming up
  the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody everybody on the planet  i 've
 had some preliminary talks and archbishop desmond tutu for example
  is very happy to give his name to this as is
 imam feisal rauf the imam in new york city
 also i would be working with
 the alliance of civilizations at the united nations i was part of that united nations
 initiative called the alliance of civilizations which was asked by kofi annan to diagnose the causes
  to give practical guidelines to member states about how
 to
 avoid
 the escalation of further extremism and the alliance has told me
 that they are very happy to work with it the importance of this is that this is i can see some of you starting to
 look worried because you think it 's a slow and cumbersome body but what the united nations can do is give us some neutrality 
 so that this isn 't seen as a western or a christian
  initiative but that it 's coming as it were from the united nations from the world who would help with the sort of
