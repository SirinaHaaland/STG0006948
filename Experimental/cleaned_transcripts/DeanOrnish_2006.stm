  all the legitimate concerns about aids and avian flu and we 'll hear about that from the brilliant dr brilliant later today i want to talk about the other pandemic which is
 cardiovascular disease diabetes hypertension all of
  completely preventable for at least ninety five percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle  and what 's happening is that there 's a globalization of illness occurring that people are starting to
 eat like us and live like us and die like us  
 and in one generation for example asia 's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest 
 and in africa cardiovascular disease equals the hiv and aids deaths in most countries 
 so there 's a critical window of opportunity we have to make
 an important difference that can affect the
  lives of literally millions of people and practice preventive medicine on a global scale 
 heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people not only in this country but also worldwide than everything else combined  and yet it 's completely preventable for almost everybody it
 's not only preventable it 's actually reversible and for the last
 almost twenty nine years we 've been able to show that by
  measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost interventions can be like quantitative arteriography before and after a year  and cardiac pet scans we showed a few months 
  ago we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle  and seventy percent
  inhibition of the tumor growth compared to only nine percent in the control group  and in the mri and mr spectroscopy here the prostate tumor activity is shown in red you can see it diminishing after a year  
 now there is an epidemic of obesity two thirds of adults and fifteen percent of kids 
 what 's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased seventy percent in the past ten years  and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do that 's
  and it 's preventable  now these are not election returns these are the people the number of the people who are obese by state beginning in
  this well you know the diet that we 've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an asian diet but the people in asia are starting to
 eat like we are which is why they 're starting to get sick like we are so i 've been working with a lot of the big food companies they can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods like i chair the
 advisory boards to mcdonald 's and pepsico and conagra and safeway and soon del monte
  and they 're finding that it 's good business the salads that you see at mcdonald 's came from the work they 're going to have an asian salad at pepsi two thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods
