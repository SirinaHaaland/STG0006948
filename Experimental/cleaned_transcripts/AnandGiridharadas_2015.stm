  where are you from said the pale tattooed man where are you from
  the worst attack on america since world war ii 
 everyone wonders about the next plane people are looking for scapegoats  
 the president the night before  pledges to bring our enemies to justice or bring justice
  surrounded by tire shops and strip joints a bangladeshi immigrant works the register back home
 was a big man an air force officer  but he dreamed of a fresh start in america if he had to work
  briefly in a mini mart to save up for i t classes and his wedding in two months so be it 
 then on september twenty one that tattooed man enters the mart he holds a shotgun
 raisuddin knows the drill  puts cash on the counter  this time  the man doesn 't touch the money
 where are you from
  feels millions of bees stinging his face  in fact  dozens of scalding birdshot pellets
 puncture his head behind the counter  he lays in blood  he cups a hand over his forehead
 to keep in the brains on which he 'd gambled everything
  verses from the koran begging his god to live he senses
 he is dying he didn 't die his right eye
 left him  his fiance
 left him  his landlord
  kicked him out soon he was homeless and sixty thousand dollars in medical debt including
 a fee for dialing for an ambulance 
 but raisuddin lived  and years later he would ask what he could do
 to repay his god and become worthy of this second
  he would come to believe in fact that this chance called for him to give a second chance
 to a man we might think deserved no chance at all 
 twelve years ago  i
 was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world 
 born in ohio to indian immigrants  i settled on the ultimate rebellion against my parents  moving to the country they had worked so damn hard to
  out of 
 what i thought might be a six month stint in mumbai stretched to six years 
 i became a writer and found myself amid a magical story the awakening of hope across much of the so called third world 
 six years ago  i returned to america
 and realized something the american dream was thriving
  but only in india 
 in america not so much  in fact  i observed that america was fracturing
 into two distinct societies a republic of dreams
 and a republic of fears  and then  i stumbled onto this incredible tale of two lives and of these two americas
 that brutally collided
  in that dallas mini mart 
 i knew at once i wanted to learn more and eventually that i would write a book about them 
 for their story was the story of america 's fracturing and
 of how it might be put back together after he was shot 
  the day after admitting him  the hospital discharged him  
 his right eye couldn 't see  he couldn 't speak metal peppered his face  
 but he had no insurance so they bounced him  
 his family in bangladesh begged him come home 
 but he told them he had a dream
  he found telemarketing work then he became an olive garden waiter because where better to get over his fear of white people
 than the olive garden 
 now as a devout muslim 
 he refused alcohol didn 't touch the stuff then he learned that not selling it
 would slash his pay so he reasoned  like a budding american
  pragmatist well god wouldn 't want me to starve would he 
 and before long  in some months raisuddin was that olive garden 's highest grossing alcohol pusher  
 he found a man who taught him database administration he got part time i t gigs  eventually he landed a six figure job at a blue chip tech company in dallas
  but as america began to work for raisuddin he avoided the classic error of the fortunate 
 assuming you 're the rule not the exception  
 in fact  he observed that many with the fortune of being born american
 were nonetheless trapped in lives that made second chances like his impossible
  he saw it at the olive garden itself 
 where so many of his colleagues had childhood horror stories of family dysfunction chaos  addiction crime 
 he 'd heard a similar tale
 about the man who shot him back when he attended his trial  the closer
  to the america he had coveted from afar the more he realized there was another  equally real america
 that was stingier with second chances  
 the man who shot raisuddin grew up in that
 stingier america from a distance  mark stroman was always the spark of parties
  always making girls feel pretty always working no matter what drugs or fights he 'd had the night before  but he 'd always
 wrestled with demons  he entered the world
 through the three gateways that doom so many young american men  bad parents  bad schools  bad prisons 
 his mother told him 
  as a boy that she 'd been just fifty dollars short of aborting him  sometimes that little boy
 would be at school he 'd suddenly pull a knife
 on his fellow classmates  
 sometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents ' tenderly feeding horses 
 he was getting arrested before he shaved first juvenile then prison he became a casual
  white supremacist
 and like so many around him  a drug addled and absent father  
 and then before long  he found himself on death row for in his two thousand and one
 he had shot not one
  death row was the first institution
 that left stroman better 
 his old influences quit him  
 the people entering his life were virtuous and caring  pastors journalists  european pen pals 
 they listened to him  prayed with
  helped him question himself and sent him on a journey of introspection
 and betterment  he finally faced the hatred that had defined his life  
 he read viktor frankl the holocaust survivor and regretted his swastika tattoos  he found god  
 then one day in two thousand and eleven
  ten years after his crimes stroman received news one of the men he 'd shot the survivor was fighting
 to save his life 
 you see late in two thousand and nine  
 eight years after that shooting raisuddin had gone on his own journey a pilgrimage to mecca 
 amid its crowds
  he felt immense gratitude but also duty 
 he recalled promising god as he lay dying in two thousand and one that if he lived  he would serve humanity all his days 
 then he 'd gotten busy relaying the bricks of a life  
 now
 it was time to pay his debts and he decided upon
  that his method of payment
 would be an intervention in the cycle of vengeance between the muslim and western worlds  and how would he intervene 
 by forgiving stroman publicly
 in the name of islam and its doctrine of mercy  and then
 suing the state of texas
 and its governor rick perry to prevent them from executing stroman exactly like most people shot in the
  face do 
 yet raisuddin 's mercy
 was inspired not only
 by faith a newly minted american citizen he had come to believe that stroman
 was the product of a hurting america that couldn 't just
  that insight is what moved me to write my book the true american this immigrant begging america to be as merciful to a native son
 as it had been to an adopted one 
 in the mini mart all those years earlier  not just two men but two americas collided 
 an america that still dreams still strives still imagines that tomorrow can build
  on today  
 and an america that has resigned to fate  
 buckled under stress and chaos  lowered expectations an ducked into the oldest of refuges  
 the tribal fellowship of one 's own narrow kind 
 and it was raisuddin despite being a newcomer despite being attacked  despite being homeless and traumatized 
 who belonged to that republic of dreams
 and stroman who belonged to that other wounded country despite being born with the privilege of a native white man 
 i realized these men 's stories formed an urgent parable about america 
 the country i am so proud to call my own
 wasn 't living through a generalized decline as
  seen in spain or greece where prospects were dimming for everyone 
 america is simultaneously the most and the least successful country in the industrialized world 
 launching the world 's best companies 
 even as record numbers of children go hungry 
  for large groups  even as it polishes the world 's best hospitals america today is a sprightly young body  
 hit by one of those strokes
 that sucks the life from one side  while leaving the other worryingly perfect on july
 twenty two thousand and eleven  right after a sobbing raisuddin testified in defense
  of stroman 's life stroman was killed
 by lethal injection
 by the state he so loved  hours earlier 
 when raisuddin still thought he could still save stroman the two men got to speak for the second time ever here is an excerpt from their phone call 
  you should know that i am praying for god the most compassionate and gracious  i forgive you
 and i do not hate you i never hated you 
 stroman 
 you are a remarkable person  thank you from my heart  i love you bro 
 even more amazingly after the execution
  and offered his help you may have lost a father he told her but you 've gained an uncle 
 he wanted her too to have a second chance 
 if human history were a
  america 's float would be a neon shrine to second chances  but america  generous
 with second chances to the children of other lands today grows miserly with first chances
 to the children of its own america still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an
  but it is losing its luster at allowing every american to become a somebody 
 over the last decade  seven million foreigners gained american citizenship remarkable 
 in the meanwhile how many americans gained a place in the middle class 
 actually the net influx was negative  go back further and it 's even more
  the middle class has shrunk
 by twenty percent  mainly because of the people tumbling out of it 
 and my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer than simple inequality what i observe is a pair of secessions
 from the unifying center of american life an affluent secession of up up and away 
 into elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix of work money and connections
  and an impoverished secession of down and out
 into disconnected dead end lives that the fortunate scarcely see 
 and don 't console yourself that you
 are the ninety nine percent  
 if you live near
  a whole foods  
 if no one in your family serves in the military 
 if you 're paid by the year not the hour  
 if
 most people you know finished college if no one you know uses meth  
 if you married once and remain married if you 're not one of sixty five million americans with a criminal record
 if any or all of these things describe you then accept the possibility that actually
 you may not know what 's going on and you may be part of the problem 
 other generations
 had to build a fresh society after slavery pull through a depression defeat fascism 
  in mississippi 
 the moral challenge of my generation i believe is to reacquaint these two americas to choose union over secession
 once again 
 this ins 't a problem we can tax or tax cut away  it won 't be solved by tweeting harder  
 building slicker apps or starting one more artisanal coffee roasting service 
 it is a moral challenge
 that begs each of us
  in the flourishing america
 to take on the wilting america as our own as raisuddin tried to do 
 like him we can make pilgrimages  
 and there  in baltimore and oregon and appalachia find new purpose as he did we can immerse ourselves in that other country bear witness to its hopes and sorrows
  and like raisuddin ask what we can do  
 what can you do 
 what can you do  
 what can we do how might we build a more merciful country 
 we the greatest
 inventors in the world can invent solutions to the problems of that
  america not only our own we the writers and the journalists can cover that america 's stories  instead of shutting down bureaus in its midst 
 we can finance that america 's ideas  instead of ideas from new york and san francisco 
 we can put our stethoscopes to its backs  teach there  go to court there  make there live there  pray there
  this i believe  is the calling of a generation 
 an america whose two halves learn again to stride to plow to forge to dare together a
 republic of chances
