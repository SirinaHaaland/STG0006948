  it 's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe  which was created for humanity to really see
 where we are in the universe  and so
  the flat horizon that we 've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite  unbounded resources
 and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste it wasn 't until we really
 left earth  got above the atmosphere
 and had seen the horizon bend back on itself
  that we could understand our planet as a limited condition 
 the digital universe atlas
 has been built at the american museum of natural history
 over the past twelve years  we maintain
  put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales 
 what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth
 in proper registration against the universe as we see  
 nasa supported this work twelve years ago as part of the
  rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world 
 the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do
 our main space shows in the dome  but what you see here is the result of actually internships that we hosted with
 linkoping university
  i 've had twelve students work on this for their graduate work and the result has been this software called uniview
 and a company called sciss in sweden
  this software allows interactive use  so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live
  captured this live from my laptop
 in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan where i live  and
 it was done as a collaborative project
 with the rubin museum of himalayan art
 for an exhibit on comparative cosmology  
 and so as we move out we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of
  galaxies as we see here light travel time giving you a sense of how far away we are 
 as we move out 
 the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long we 're essentially backing up into the past 
 we back so far up
 we 're finally seeing a containment around us the afterglow of the big bang this is the
 background
 that we see we 'll fly outside it here just to see this sort of containment  if we were outside this 
 it would almost be meaningless in the sense as before time  but this our containment of the visible universe we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see 
 coming back quickly 
 we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning but these are positions the
 latest positions of
  exoplanets that we 've mapped  and our sun here obviously with our own solar system 
 what you 're going to see we 're going to have to jump in here
 pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down
 to where we see the solar system these are the paths of voyager one voyager two pioneer eleven and pioneer ten the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system
  coming in closer  picking up earth 
 orbit of the moon and we see the earth  
 this map
 can be updated  and we can add in new data  i know dr carolyn porco is the camera  p i for the cassini mission but here we see the complex
 trajectory of the cassini mission
  color coded for different mission phases  
 ingeniously developed so that forty five encounters with the largest moon  titan which is larger that the planet mercury  diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase 
 this software allows us to come close and look
 at parts of this  this software can also be networked between domes we have a growing user base of this  and we network domes
 and we can network between domes and classrooms we 're actually sharing
 tours of the universe with the first sub saharan planetarium in ghana
 as well as
 new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school
 in cambodia
  the cambodians have actually controlled the hayden planetarium from their high school 
 this is an image from saturday  photographed by the aqua satellite but through the uniview software so you 're seeing the edge of the earth this is nepal this is in fact right here is the valley
 of lhasa  right here in tibet but we can see the haze
 from fires and so forth in the ganges valley down below in india this is nepal and tibet
 and just in closing i 'd
 just like to say this beautiful world that we live on
 here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out
 so i 'd like to just say that what the world needs now is is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger
  condition now
 and a much larger sense of what home is 
 because our home is the universe  
 and we are the universe essentially  we carry that in us and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all i think in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe thank you
