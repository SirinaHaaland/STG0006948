  let 's talk about manias let 's start with beatlemania
  there 's weeping  there 's visions  manias can be good manias can
  the world has a new mania 
 a mania for learning english  listen as chinese students practice their english  by screaming it
  how many people are trying to learn english worldwide
  latin america in india  in southeast asia  and most of all in china 
 if you 're a chinese student you start learning english in the third grade by law 
 that 's why this year  china will become the world 's largest
  word  opportunity opportunity for a better life  a job to be able to pay for school or put better food on the table  
 imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days her score on this one test literally determines her future she studies twelve hours a day for three years to prepare
  is based on english it 's called the gaokao and eighty million high school chinese students have already taken this grueling test the intensity 
  to learn english is almost unimaginable unless you witness it
  so is english mania good or bad is english a tsunami washing away other languages  not likely
  english is the world 's second language your native language is your life  but with english you can become part of a wider conversation
 a global conversation about global problems  like climate change or poverty 
 or hunger or disease the world has other universal languages  mathematics is the language of science
  is the language of emotions and now english is becoming the language of 
 not because america is pushing it  but because the world is pulling it  
 so english mania is a turning point 
 like the harnessing of electricity in our cities or the fall of the berlin wall english represents hope
 for a better future
 a future where the world has a common language to solve its common problems  thank you very much
