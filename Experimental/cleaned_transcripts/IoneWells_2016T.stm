  i was on an evening out with friends to celebrate one of their birthdays we hadn 't been all together for a couple of weeks it was a perfect evening as we were all reunited 
 at the end of the evening  i caught the last underground train back to the other side of london
 the journey was smooth  i got back to my local station and i began the  10 minute walk home 
 as i turned the corner onto my street my house in sight up ahead 
 i heard footsteps behind me that seemed to have approached out of nowhere and were picking up pace  
 before i had time to process what was happening a hand was clapped around my mouth so that i could not breathe  and the young man behind me dragged me
  to the ground  beat my head repeatedly against the pavement until my face began to bleed  kicking me in the back and neck
 while he began to assault me ripping off my clothes and telling me to shut up as i struggled to cry for help 
 with each smack of my head to the concrete ground a question echoed through my mind that still haunts me today 
 is this going to be how it all ends 
 little could i have realized
  i 'd been followed the whole way from the moment i left the station 
 and hours later  
 i was standing topless and  barelegged in front of the police  having the cuts and bruises on my naked body photographed for forensic evidence now
 there are few words to describe the all consuming feelings of vulnerability shame upset and injustice that i was ridden with in that moment and for the weeks to come 
 but wanting to find a way
  to condense these feelings into something ordered that i could work through  i decided to do what felt most natural to me  i wrote about it it
 started out as a cathartic exercise  i wrote a letter to my assaulter 
 humanizing him as you to identify him as part of the very community that he had so violently abused
  effect of his actions i wrote did you ever think of the people in your life 
 i don 't know who the people in your life are i don 't know anything about you but i do know this you did not just attack me that night  
 i 'm a daughter  i 'm a friend i 'm a sister  i 'm a pupil i 'm a cousin i 'm a niece i 'm a neighbor 
 i 'm the employee who served everyone coffee in the caf under the railway  
 and all the people who form these relations to me
  up my community and you assaulted every single one of them 
 you violated the truth that i will never cease to fight for and which all of these people represent that there are infinitely more good people in the world than bad 
 but determined not to let this one incident make me lose faith in the solidarity in my community or humanity as a whole i recalled the seven
 seven terrorist bombings in july two thousand and five on london transport and how the mayor of london at the time and indeed my own parents had insisted that we all get back on the tubes the next day so we wouldn 't be defined or changed by those that had made us feel unsafe  
 i told my attacker 
 you 've carried out your attack but now i 'm getting back on my tube my community will not feel we are unsafe walking home after dark we will get on
  last tubes home and we will walk up our streets alone because we will not ingrain or submit to the idea that we are putting ourselves in danger in doing so 
 we will continue to come together  like an army when any member of our community is threatened  
 and this is a fight you will not win at
 the time of writing this letter thank you 
 at the time of writing this letter i was studying for my exams in oxford and i was working on the local student paper there
  despite being lucky enough to have friends and family supporting me it was an isolating time 
 i didn 't know anyone who 'd been through this before at least i didn 't think i did i 'd read news reports statistics and knew how common sexual assault was 
 yet i couldn 't actually name a single person that i 'd heard speak out about an experience of this kind before 
 so in a somewhat spontaneous decision  i decided that i would publish my letter in the student paper hoping to reach out to others in oxford that might have
  had a similar experience and be feeling the same way at
 the end of the letter i asked others to write in with their experiences under the hashtag # notguilty 
 to emphasize that survivors of assault could express themselves without feeling shame or guilt about what happened to them to show that we could all stand up to sexual assault 
 what i never anticipated is that almost overnight this published letter would go viral  soon we were receiving hundreds of stories
  from men and women across the world which we began to publish on a website i set up and the hashtag became a campaign 
 there was an australian mother in her 40s who described how on an evening out she was followed to the bathroom by a man who went to repeatedly grab her crotch  
 there was a man in the netherlands who described how he was  date raped on a visit to london and wasn 't taken seriously by anyone he reported his case to 
 i had personal facebook messages from people in india and south
  america saying how can we bring the message of the campaign there 
 one of the first contributions we had was from a woman called nikki who described growing up being molested my her own father  
 and i had friends open up to me about experiences ranging from those that happened last week to those that happened years ago that i 'd had no idea about 
 and the more we started to receive these messages
  more we also started to receive messages of hope
 people feeling empowered by this community of voices standing up to sexual assault and victim blaming one
 woman called olivia after describing how she was attacked by someone she had trusted and cared about for a long time said 
 i 've read many of the stories posted here and i feel hopeful that if so many women can move forward then i can too i
 've been inspired by many  and i hope i can be as strong as them someday i 'm sure i will 
 people around the world began tweeting under this hashtag and the letter was republished and covered by
  the national press as well as being translated into several other languages worldwide  
 but something struck me about the media attention that this letter was attracting 
 for something to be front page news  given the word news itself we can assume it must be something new or something surprising  
 and yet sexual assault is not something new
  along with other kinds of injustices is reported in the media all the time 
 but through the campaign these injustices were framed as not just news stories they were firsthand experiences that had affected real people who were creating with the solidarity of others what they needed and had previously lacked 
 a platform to speak out the reassurance they weren 't alone or to blame for what happened to them and open discussions that would help to reduce stigma around the issue 
 the voices of those directly affected were at the forefront of the story
 not the voices of journalists or commentators on social media and that 's why the story was news  
 we live in an incredibly interconnected world with the proliferation of social media which is of course a fantastic resource for igniting social change but it
 's also made us increasingly reactive 
 from the smallest annoyances of oh my train
  to the greatest injustices
 of war genocides terrorist attacks our default response has become to leap to react to any kind of grievance by tweeting facebooking hastagging anything to show others that we too have reacted  
 the problem with reacting in this manner en masse is it can sometimes mean that we don 't actually react at all not in the sense of actually doing anything anyway 
 it might make ourselves feel better like we 've contributed to a group
  actually change anything and what 's more it can sometimes drown out the voices of those directly affected by the injustice  whose needs must be heard 
 worrying too is the tendency for some reactions to injustice to build even more walls  being quick to point fingers with the hope of providing easy solutions to complex problems  
 one british tabloid on the publication of my letter branded
  oxford student launches online campaign to shame attacker 
 but the campaign never meant to shame anyone it meant to let people speak and to make others listen  
 divisive twitter trolls were quick to create even more injustice  commenting on my attacker 's ethnicity or class to push their own prejudiced agendas  
 and some even accused me of feigning
  as if i 'm going to be like hey guys sorry i can 't make it i 'm busy trying to hate the entire male population by the time i 'm thirty 
 laughter now i 'm almost sure that these people wouldn 't say the things they say in person but it 's as if because they might be behind a screen in the
  own home when on social media people forget that what they 're doing is a public act that other people will be reading it and be affected by it  
 returning to my analogy of getting back on our trains  
 another main concern i have about this noise that escalates from our online responses to injustice is that it can very easily slip into portraying us as the affected party which can lead to a sense of defeatism a 
  kind of mental barrier to seeing any opportunity for positivity or change after a negative situation a
  of this happened to me i went to a tedx event in oxford  
 and i saw zelda la grange speak the former private secretary to nelson mandela one of the stories she told really struck me 
 she spoke of when mandela was taken to court by the south african rugby union after he commissioned an inquiry into sports affairs in the courtroom he went up to the south african rugby union 's
  shook them by the hand and conversed with them each in their own language  and zelda wanted to protest saying they had no right to his respect after this injustice they had caused him 
 he turned to her and said you must never allow the enemy to determine the grounds for battle at
 the time of hearing these words i didn 't really know why they were so important but i felt they were and i wrote them down in a notebook i had on me
  about this line a lot ever since  
 revenge or the expression of hatred towards those who have done us injustice may feel like a human instinct in the face of wrong but
 we need to break out of these cycles if we are to hope to transform negative events of injustice into positive social change 
 to do otherwise continues to let the enemy determine the grounds for battle  
 creates a binary  where we who have suffered become the affected pitted against them  the perpetrators
  and just like we got back on our tubes we can 't let our platforms for interconnectivity and community be the places that we settle for defeat  
 but i don 't want to discourage a social media response because i owe the development of the # notguilty campaign almost entirely to social media but
 i do want to encourage a more considered approach to the way we use it to respond
  i think is to ask ourselves two things  firstly why do i feel this injustice in
 my case there were several answers to this someone had hurt me and those who i loved under the assumption they wouldn 't have to be held to account or recognize the damage they had caused 
 not only that but thousands of men and women suffer every day from sexual abuse often in silence  yet it 's still a problem we don 't give the same airtime to as other issues it 's still an issue many people blame
  ask yourself how in recognizing these reasons could i go about reversing them 
 with us this was holding my attacker to account and many others it was calling them out on the effect they had caused it was giving airtime to the issue of sexual assault  opening up discussions 
  amongst friends amongst families in the media that had been closed for too long and stressing that victims shouldn 't feel to blame for what happened to them 
 still have a long way to go in solving this problem entirely 
 but in this way we can begin to use social media as an active tool for social justice as a tool to educate to stimulate dialogues to make those in positions of authority aware of an issue by listening to those directly affected by it  
 because
 sometimes these questions don 't have easy answers in fact they rarely do  but this doesn 't mean we still can 't give them a considered response
  in situations where you can 't go about thinking how you 'd reverse this feeling of injustice you can still think maybe not what you can do but what you can not do 
 you can not build further walls by fighting injustice with more prejudice more hatred  
 you can not speak over those directly affected by an injustice  
 and you can not react to injustice only to forget about it the next day just because the rest of twitter has moved on 
 sometimes not reacting instantly is
  ironically  the best immediate course of action we can take 
 because we might be angry upset and energized by injustice  but let 's consider our responses 
 let us hold people to account without descending into a culture that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves 
 let us remember that distinction so often forgotten by internet users  between criticism and
  insult  
 let us not forget to think before we speak just because we might have a screen in front of us 
 and when we create noise on social media let it not drown out the needs of those affected but instead let it amplify their voices so the internet becomes a place where you 're not the exception if you speak out about something that has actually happened to you 
 all these considered approaches to injustice evoke the very keystones on which the internet was built 
 to network
  have signal to connect all these terms that imply bringing people together not pushing people apart  
 because if you look up the word justice in the dictionary 
 before punishment before administration of law or judicial authority 
 you get the maintenance of what is right and i think there are few things more
  people together  than unions  
 and if we allow social media to deliver that  then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice  indeed  thank you very much
