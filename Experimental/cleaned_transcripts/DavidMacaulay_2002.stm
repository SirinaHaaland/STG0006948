  i draw to better understand things  sometimes i make a lot of drawings and i still don 't understand
 what it is i 'm drawing those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship
 might be amused to know that the guy who is
  is best known for the way things work while preparing for
 part of a panel for called understanding spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate
 with his new cd burner 
 who knew about extension managers  i 've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me
  instructions but i did finally figure it out i had to figure it out because along with the invitation came the frightening
 reminder that there would be no projector 
 so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would  now 
 i could talk about something that i 'm known for something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the
 more technically minded people here
  i could talk about something i really care about i decided to go with the latter i 'm going
 to talk about rome now why would i care about rome  particularly  well  i went to rhode island school of design
 in the second half of the ' 60s to study architecture i was lucky enough to spend my last year my fifth year in rome as a
  changed my life not
 the least reason was the fact that i had spent those first four years living at home  
 driving into risd everyday  driving back  i missed the ' 60s i read about them 
 i understand they were pretty interesting  i missed them  but i did spend that extraordinary year in rome and it 's a place
  that is never far from my mind so whenever given an opportunity i try to do something in it or with it or for it 
 i also make drawings to help people understand things 
 things that i want them to believe i understand 
 and that 's what i do as an illustrator that 's my job  so i 'm going to show you some pictures of rome i 've made a lot of drawings of rome over the years 
 these are just drawings of rome i get back as often as possible i need to all different
  materials all different styles all different times  drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of rome  
 part of the reason i 'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process i go through of trying to figure out what it is i feel about rome and why i feel it 
 these are sketches of some of the little details rome is a city full of surprises i mean we 're talking about unusual perspectives we 're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open
  into vast
 piazzas
 never though piazzas that are not humanly scaled 
 part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically that amazing juxtaposition of old and new  
 the bits of light
 that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that 's traveling above your head of usually blue especially in the summer
  compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets and i began to think about how i could communicate this in book form how could i share my
 sense of rome my understanding of rome and i 'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends basically  
 the primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you 're not quite sure where you 're going you 're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency
  here 's a little map and i thought of maps at the beginning maybe i should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in rome and here 's a
 line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the the page here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways  
 maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human
 aspect to this maybe i should get
  away from this map completely and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air which happens
 in so many of the squares in the city and let it bounce off of things and i 'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits that seemed like a sort of a cheap shot but
 even though i just started this presentation this is not the first thing that i tried to do and i was getting sort of desperate eventually i realized that i had really no content
  i could count on so i decided to move towards packaging i mean 
 it seems to work for for a lot of things so
 i thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick  but one of the ideas that emerged from from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through rome
 in different vehicles at different
 speeds in order to show
 the different aspects of rome sort of an overview of rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible  quick
 snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter and very slow walking through rome you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful
 surfaces and whatnot that you come across anyways i went back to the dirigible notion went to alberto
  one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so i could actually use it as a scale that i would then juxtapose with
 some of the things in rome this thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of but it would be like having a ruler sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler 
 not that you know how long number eleven actually is but you would be able to compare number eleven against the pantheon with number eleven against the baths of caracalla and so on and so forth  if you were interested this is beatrix she has a dog
 a dog named ajax she has purchased a dirigible a small dirigible she 's assembling the structure  ajax is sniffing for holes
 in the in the balloon before they set off she launches this thing above the spanish steps
 and sets off for an aerial tour of the city over the spanish steps we go a nice way to show that that
  that stream sort of pouring down the hill  unfortunately just across the road from it or quite quite close by is the the column of marcus aurelius and
 the diameter
 of the dirigible makes an impression as you can see as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the column of marcus aurelius gets a little too close  nudges it  
 this gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the column of marcus aurelius which is really
  more than a pile of quarters high thick quarters over the piazza of saint ignacio completely ruining the symmetry but that aside
 a spectacular place
 to visit a spectacular framework 
 inside of which you see 
 usually extraordinary blue sky over the pantheon and the 26 foot diameter oculus she parks her dirigible lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for
  the text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around and you can see it from
 ground point of view and from her point of view looking in the hole getting a different kind of perspective moving you around the space particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly
 a sphere
 dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus unfortunately for her the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some boy scouts who are visiting the
  pantheon and they are immediately yanked out
 and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of rome  which would from their point of view naturally be hanging upside down 
 they bail out as soon as they get to the top of saint ivo that little spiral structure you see there she continues on her way over piazza navona  notices a lot of activity at the tre scalini restaurant is reminded that it is lunchtime and she 's hungry 
  motoring towards the campo de ' fiori  
 which they soon reach  ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon and then is completely removed and doesn 't appear again until six or seven the following morning  
 anyway  the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff
  makes a lunge for it she 's managed to save the prosciutto but in the process she loses the tablecloth which you can see
 flying away in the upper  left hand corner 
 they continue without their tablecloth looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch they eventually discover a huge wall that 's filled with small holes ideal for
 docking a dirigible because you 've got a place to tie up 
 turns out to be the exterior wall that part of it that remains of the coliseum  so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view 
 at the end of lunch they untie the anchor they set off through the baths of caracalla
 and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned
 gatehouse and
 decide to take one more look at the pyramid of cestius which has this lightning rod on top unfortunately that 's a problem they get a little too close
  and when you 're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes so that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion marcello on the other hand
 is sort of a lazy guy but
 he 's not due at work until about noon so the alarm goes off and it
 's five to twelve or so he gets up  leaps onto his scooter races through the city past the church of santa maria della pace  down the alleys through the
 tourists may be wandering through  disturbing the quiet backstreet life of rome at every turn that speed with which he is moving i hope i have
 suggested in this little image which again can be turned around and read from both sides because there 's text on the bottom and text on the top one of which is upside down in this image  
 so  he keeps on moving
 approaching
 an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver
 two plates of
 linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table
 just outside of a restaurant in the street  waiter catches on but it 's too late  and
 marcello keeps moving in his scooter
 everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine but keeps on moving because this guy 's got a job to do 
 removes some scaffolding one of the reasons rome remains the
  extraordinary place it is that
 because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself or we find it  
 right through the piazza della rotonda in front of the pantheon again
 wreaking havoc and finally getting to work marcello as it turns out is the driver
  if you 've been on the number sixty four bus you know that it 's driven with the same kind of exuberance as marcello demonstrated on his scooter
 and finally carletto you see his apartment in the upper left hand corner he 's looking at his table he 's planning to propose this evening
 to his girlfriend of forty years and
 he wants it to be perfect he 's got candles out he 's got flowers in the middle and he 's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses but he 's not happy  something 's wrong
  the phone rings anyway  he 's called to the palazzo he saunters he saunters at a good clip but as compared to all the traveling we 've just seen he 's sauntering  
 everybody knows
 carletto because he 's in entertainment actually he 's in television he 's actually in television repair   which is why people know him
 so they all have his number he arrives at the palazzo  arrives at the big front door
  enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian who tells him that there 's been a disaster in the palazzo  nobody 's tvs are working and there 's a big soccer game coming up and
 the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous he goes down to the basement
 and starts to check the wiring and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building apartment by
  every television checking every connection hoping to find out what this problem is he works his way up finally the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic  
 he opens the window of the attic of course and there 's a tablecloth wrapped around the building 's television antenna  
 he removes it the problems are solved everybody in the palazzo is happy and of course  he also solves his own problem 
 all he has to do now with a perfect table is wait for her to arrive that was the first attempt
  didn 't seem substantial enough to to convey
 whatever it was i wanted to convey about rome so i thought well i 'll just do piazzas and i 'll
 get inside and underneath and i 'll show these things growing and show why they 're shaped the way they are and so on and then i thought that 's too complicated 
 no i 'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and i 'll put them inside the pantheon
 but keep the scale 
  so you can see the top of sant 'ivo and the pyramid of cestius and the tempietto of bramante all side by side in this amazing space  
 now that 's one drawing so i thought maybe it 's time for piranesi to meet escher laughter
 you see that i 'm beginning to really lose control here and also
 also hope there 's a very thin blue line
 of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together
 not only a neat way of collecting and storing information it 's a series of layers i mean you always peel one layer off another we think of them as pages doing it a certain way but think of them as layers i mean rome is a place of layers
 horizontal layers vertical layers and i thought  well just peeling off a page would allow me to if i got you thinking about it the right
  would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers the stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in rome covers
 the scars the scars of
 centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down if i do a foldout page on the  left hand side
 and let you just unfold it you see behind it what i mean by scar tissue you can see that
 in one thousand six hundred and thirty five it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever
  adaptations all get buried under the stucco i could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what 's going on inside of it but more importantly i could also 
  show you what it what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco  which is more often the case 
  those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold double foldout page
 which if you were like me reading a pop up book as a child you hopefully stick your head into 
 you wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time and i 've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages
 i thought maybe i could be simpler here 
 let 's look at the pantheon and the piazza della rotonda in front of it here 's a book completely wide open  
 ok  if i don 't open the book the whole way if i just open it ninety degrees  we 're looking down the front of the pantheon and we 're looking
 sort of at the top 
 more or less down on the square and if i turn the book the other way  we 're looking across the square at the front of the pantheon no foldouts no tricks just a book that isn 't open the whole way  that seemed promising i thought maybe i 'll do it inside
  and i can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book so we get inside the pantheon and it grows and
 so on and so forth and i thought maybe i 'm on the right track but it sort of lost its human quality so i went back to the notion of story which is always a good thing to have if you 're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way pigeon
 's progress struck me
  a catchy title if it was a homing pigeon it would be called homer 's odyssey but it was the journey of the i
 if a title works use it but it would be a journey that went through rome and showed all the things that i like about rome it 's a pigeon sitting on top of a church goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff 
 comes back the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there 's no way this pigeon can get home  
  another place to live and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things and we start with the tall ones and so on maybe it has to go back and live with family members that 's not always a good thing but
 it does sort of
 bring bring pigeons together again
 and i thought that 's sort of interesting but maybe there 's a person who should be involved in this in some way so i kind of came up with this old guy who
  his life looking after sick pigeons he 'll go anywhere to get them dangerous places and whatnot and they become really friends with this guy and
 learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that 
 there 's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons but unfortunately he gets sick he
 gets really sick at the end of the story he 's taught them to spell his name which is aldo they show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him
  he lives in this little garret and
 they spell his name and fly around and he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof  and
 all the pigeons  a la red balloon are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city 
 and i forgot to mention this whenever he lost a pigeon he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city in the old roman custom
 the dead were never buried within the walls and i thought that 's a really cheery story
 going to go a long way so anyway
 i went through and
 again  if packaging doesn 't work and if the stories aren 't going anywhere i just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction and sometimes it does focus me enough
 and i 'll even do a title page so these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution i settled on which is the story of
 a young woman who sends a message
  on a homing pigeon she lives outside the walls of the city of rome to someone in the city 
 and the pigeon is flying down above the appian way here you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way if you see the red line you are seeing the trail of the pigeon 
 if you don 't see the red line you are the pigeon 
 and it becomes necessary and possible at this point to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually
 past the pyramid of cestius these will seem very familiar to you even if you haven 't been to rome recently past the gatehouse 
 this is something that 's a little bit unusual this pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do it takes the scenic route which was
 a device that i felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four
  the church of santa maria in cosmedin and the temple of hercules towards the river  we almost collide with the cornice of the palazzo farnese
 designed by michelangelo  built of stone taken from the coliseum narrow escape we swoop down over the campo de ' fiori this is one of those things i show to my students 
  because it 's a complete bastardization a denial of any rules of perspective
 the only rule of perspective that i think matters is if it looks believable you 've succeeded  but you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here a
 couple are on mars and  a couple of others in cremona but
 into the
 the piazza in front of santa maria della pace where invariably a soccer game is going on and we 're hit by a soccer
  this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball i have all the pieces there 's santa maria della pace  there 's a soccer ball there 's a little bit of a bird 's wing nothing 's happening  
 so i had to rethink it 
 and if you do want to see santa maria della pace these books are really flexible  incredibly interactive just turn it around and look at it the other way
  through the alley we can see the impact is is
  and then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower one of the few remaining medieval towers towards the church of 
 sant  'agnese and around the dome looking down into piazza navona which we 've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times there 's the bernini statue of the four rivers
 and then past the wonderful borromini sant 'ivo stopping just long enough on the  26 foot diameter oculus of the pantheon to catch
  our breath and then we can swoop inside and around and because we 're flying we don 't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time so this drawing can be oriented in any way
