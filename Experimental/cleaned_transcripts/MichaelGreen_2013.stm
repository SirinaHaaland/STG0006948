  my son
 my grandfather taught me to work with wood when i was a little boy and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something
 honor that tree 's life and make it as beautiful as you
  possibly can my little boy reminded me
 that for all the technology and all the toys in the world sometimes just a small block of wood if you stack it up tall actually is an incredibly inspiring thing
 these are my buildings i build all around the world out of our office in vancouver and new york and we build buildings of different sizes and
  styles and different materials depending on where we are but wood is the material that i love the most and i 'm going to tell you the story about wood
 and part of the reason i love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood i notice they react completely differently i 've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column but i 've actually seen
  in a wood building i 've actually seen how people touch the wood and i think there 's a reason for it
 just like snowflakes no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on earth that 's a wonderful thing
 i like to think that wood
 gives mother nature fingerprints in our buildings
 it 's mother nature 's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment
 now i live in vancouver near a forest that grows to thirty three
  tall down the coast here in california the redwood forest grows to forty stories tall
 but the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on earth
 even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build
 much taller than four stories in many places and that 's true here in the united states now there are exceptions but there needs to be some exceptions and things are going to
  change i 'm hoping and the reason i think that way is that today half of us live in cities and that number is going to grow to seventy five percent
 cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big
 and i think there 's a role for wood to play in cities
 and i feel that way because three billion people in the world today over the next twenty years will need a new home
 that 's forty percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next twenty years
 now one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum
 that 's one billion people in the world live in slums a hundred million people in the world are homeless the scale of the challenge for
 for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people
 but the challenge is as we move to cities
 cities are built in these two materials steel and concrete and they 're great materials they 're the materials of the last century
 but they 're also materials with very high energy and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process
 steel represents about three percent of man 's greenhouse gas
  emissions and concrete is over five percent
 so if you think about that eight percent of our contribution to to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone
 we don 't think about it a lot and and unfortunately we actually don 't even think about buildings i think as much as we should this is a u s statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases
 almost half of our greenhouse gases are related
  to the building industry and if we look at energy it 's the same story you 'll notice that transportation 's sort of second down that list but that 's the conversation we mostly hear about
 and although a lot of that is about energy
 it 's also so much about carbon
 the problem i see is that ultimately the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home and climate
  change are a head on collision about to happen or already happening
 that challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways and i think wood is going to be part of that solution and i 'm going to tell you the story of why
 as an architect wood is the only material big material that i can build with that 's already grown by the power of the sun
  when a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide and it dies and it falls to the forest floor
 it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground if it burns in a forest fire it 's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well
 but if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy
  it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration
 one cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide
 now our two solutions to climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage wood is the only major material building material i can build with that actually does both those two things
 so i believe that we have
  an ethic that the earth grows our our food and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the earth should grow our homes
 now how are we going to do that when we 're urbanizing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories we need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger and what we 've been working on is thirty story tall
 buildings made of wood
 we 've been engineering them with
  named eric karsh who works with me on it
 and we 've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use and we call them mass timber panels these are panels made with young trees small 
 growth trees small pieces of wood glued together to make panels that are enormous eight feet wide sixty four feet long and of various thicknesses
  that 's what people jump to as a conclusion
 two by four construction is sort of like the little eight dot bricks of lego that we all played with as kids and you can make all kinds of cool things out of lego at that size and out of two by fours
 but do remember when you were a kid and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement and you found that big twenty four dot brick of lego
 and you were kind of like cool this is awesome i can build something really big and this is going to be great
 that 's the change mass
  timber panels are those twenty four dot bricks they 're changing the scale of what we can do and what we 've developed is something we call fftt which is a creative commons solution
 to building
 a very flexible system
 of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to
 this animation shows you how the building goes together in a very
  simple way but these buildings
 are available for architects and engineers now to build on for different cultures in the world different architectural styles and characters in order for us
 to build safely we 've engineered these buildings actually to work in a vancouver context where we 're a high seismic zone even at thirty stories tall
  now obviously every time i bring this up people even you know here at the conference say are you serious thirty stories how 's that going to happen and there 's a lot of really
 good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our our report and the peer reviewed report i 'm just going to focus on a few of them and let 's start with fire because i think fire is probably the first one that you 're all thinking about right now
 fair enough and the way i describe it is this if i asked you to take a match and light it and hold
  up a log and try to get that log to go on fire it doesn 't happen right we all know that but to build a fire you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up and eventually you can add the log to the fire
 and when you do add the log to the fire of course it burns but it burns slowly
 well mass timber panels these new products that we 're using are much like the log it 's hard to start them on fire and when they do they actually burn
  extraordinarily predictably and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel
 the next big issue deforestation
 eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation the last thing we want to do is cut down trees
  the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees
 there are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems now i actually think 
 that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation
  cycles ten twelve fifteen year old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale
 we 've calculated a twenty story building we 'll grow enough wood in north america every thirteen minutes that 's how much it takes
 the carbon story here is a really good one
 if we built a twenty story building out of cement and concrete the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and one thousand two hundred tonnes of carbon
 dioxide
 if we did it in wood
 in this solution we 'd sequester about three thousand one hundred tonnes for a net difference of four thousand three
 hundred tonnes that 's the equivalent of about nine hundred cars removed from the road in one year
 think back to that three billion people that need a new home and maybe this is a contributor to reducing
 we 're at the beginning of a revolution i hope in the way we build because this is the first new
  to build a skyscraper in probably one hundred years or more
 but the challenge is changing society 's perception of possibility and it 's a huge challenge the engineering is truthfully the easy part of this
 and the way i describe it is this the first skyscraper technically and the definition of a skyscraper is ten stories tall believe it or not but the first skyscraper was this one in chicago and people were terrified to walk underneath this building
 but only four years after it was built gustave eiffel was building the eiffel tower
 and as he built the eiffel tower he changed the skylines of the cities of the world
 changed and created a competition between places like new york city and chicago where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing
  the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering
 we built this model in new york actually
 as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like because the exterior can change it 's really just the structure that we 're talking about
 the reason we picked it is because this is a technical university and i believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material i can build with it just happens
  to be that mother nature holds the patent and we don 't really feel comfortable with it but that 's the way it should be nature 's fingerprints in the built environment
 i 'm looking for this opportunity to create an eiffel tower moment we call it buildings are starting to go up around the world there 's a building in london that 's nine stories a
  new building that just finished in australia that i believe is ten or eleven we 're starting to push
  the height up of of these wood buildings and we 're hoping and i 'm hoping that my hometown of vancouver actually
 potentially announces the world 's tallest at around twenty stories
 in the not so distant future
 that eiffel tower moment will break the ceiling these arbitrary ceilings of height and allow wood buildings to join the competition and i believe the race is ultimately on thank you
