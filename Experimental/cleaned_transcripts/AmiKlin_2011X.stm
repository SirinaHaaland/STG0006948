  always wanted to become
 a walking laboratory of social engagement to resonate other people 's feelings  thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them
  as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance 
 that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye 
 we intuit other people 's feelings  we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen 
 we 're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else 's subjectivity  we do that all the time we just can 't shake it off  
 it 's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves
 to understand the world around us are shaped by that stance we are social to the core  
 so my journey in autism really started when i lived in a residential unit
 for adults with autism  most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long stay hospitals this is a long
  for them autism was devastating  
 they had profound intellectual disabilities  they didn 't talk but most of all  
 they were extraordinarily isolated
 from the world around them from their environment
 and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals with autism you 'd hear a lot of noise  
  commotion actions people doing things  but they 're always doing things by themselves  
 so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling  or they may be isolated in the corner 
 or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements 
  now we know that autism
 is this disruption the disruption of this resonance
 that i am telling you about these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited
 over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of utter fragility
  without the caregiver they wouldn 't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them
 with these mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first
 days and weeks of life  babies prefer to
 hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment  they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they 're looking at people they look at people 's eyes
  because the eye is the window
 to the other person 's experiences  so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away  
 well  they orient to the caregiver  the caregiver seeks the baby and it 's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography
 that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the
  social mind the social brain
 depends on  we always think about autism
 as as something that happens later on in life  
 it doesn 't it begins with the beginning of life
  as babies engage with
  they soon realize that well there is something between the ears
 that is very important it 's invisible you can 't see it but it 's really critical  
 and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere
 in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people 's gazes  because whatever people are looking at is
  they are thinking about  
 and soon enough  they start to learn about the meaning of things  
 because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something they 're not just getting a directional cue  
 they are getting the other person 's meaning of that thing the attitude  and soon
  they start building
 this body of meanings  but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction 
 those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others  
 well  
 this is a 
 little girl  and she has autism and i am coming so close to her that i am maybe two inches from her
  face  
 and she 's quite oblivious to me  imagine if i did that to you
 came two inches from your face you 'd do probably two things wouldn 't you you would recoil you would call the police 
 you would do something because it 's literally impossible to penetrate somebody 's physical space
 and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom
  by our language our body just knows that  
 and we 've known that for a long time  and this is not something that happens to humans only  it happens to some of our phyletic cousins  
 because if you 're a monkey  
 and you look at another monkey  and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be
 a signal or threat well you
  not going to be alive for long  so something that in other species are survival
 mechanisms  without which
 they wouldn 't basically live we bring into the context of human beings  and this is what we need to simply act socially 
 now she is oblivious to me and i 'm so close to her and you think  maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later
  she goes to the corner of the room  and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an m & m so
 i could not attract her attention  but something a thing did 
 now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people 
  for this girl that division line
 is not so clear 
 and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences
 what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging 
 moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines who
  to be but in fact the brain also becomes who we are and at the same time
 that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction 
 this is what 's happening with her mind  and this is what 's happening with her brain 
 well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders
 and it 's a brain disorder it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born
  we now know that there is a very broad spectrum
 of autism  there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted there are those individuals who don 't talk
  those individuals who talk too much 
 there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school 
 you see them running the periphery fence all the school day if you let them 
 to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly relentlessly  but often
 in an awkward fashion  without that immediate resonance  
 well  this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when i started in this field we thought there were four individuals with autism
  per ten thousand a very rare condition  
 well  now we  know it 's more like one in one hundred there are millions of individuals with autism all around us
  the societal cost of this condition is huge 
 in the us alone maybe thirty five to eighty billion dollars  and you know what most of those funds are associated
 with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely
  disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of sixty thousand to eighty thousand dollars a year 
 those are individuals who did not benefit
 from early treatment  because now we know
 that autism creates itself
 as individuals diverge in that pathway of learning that i mentioned to you were we to be able to identify
  this condition at an earlier point  and intervene and treat
 i can tell you this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years  this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition 
 also we have a window of opportunity  because the brain is malleable for just so long  and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life
  not that that window closes  it doesn 't  
 but it diminishes considerably 
 and yet  the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years  
 and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don 't have access to clinical services rural populations  minorities 
  the age of diagnosis is later still 
 which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe  
 so i feel that we have a bioethical imperative  the science is there 
 but no science is of relevance if it doesn 't have an impact
 on the community and we just can 't afford that missed opportunity  because children with autism become adults with autism
  and
 we feel that those things we can do for these children for those families early on  will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family  and for the community at large  
 so this is
 our view of autism  
 there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe there are going to be something between three hundred and six hundred genes associated with autism
 and genetic anomalies much more than just genes  
 and we actually have a bit of a question here  
 because if there are so many different causes of autism  how do you go from those liabilities
 to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a playroom
  we recognize a child as having autism  so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity  
 and the answer is what lies in between  
 which is development and in fact  we are very interested in those first two years of life  
 because those liabilities don 't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself 
 were we to be able to intervene during those
 years of life
 we might attenuate for some and god knows  maybe even prevent for others  
 so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person 's being 
 i remember when i interacted with that
  how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about 
 it 's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies  we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes 
 and so in the past many years we 've been
 building these new technologies that are
 based on eye tracking  we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with
 this is my colleague warren jones with whom we 've been building these methods these studies for the past twelve years  and you see there
 little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from
  his world his mom the caregiver  but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his daycare  
 what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that 
 we had to create these very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies 
 how newborns engage with the world moment by moment 
 what is important and what is not
  well  we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you 're watching a video
 those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of thirty five typically developing two year olds 
 and we freeze one frame  
 and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are
 two year olds with autism  so on that frame  the children
 who are typical are watching this 
 the emotion of expression of that little boy as he 's fighting a little bit with the little girl  
 what are the children with autism doing they are focusing on the revolving
 door opening
  and shutting 
 well i can tell you that this divergence that you 're seeing here doesn 't happen only in our five minute experiment  
 it happens moment by moment in their real lives 
 and their minds are being formed
 and their brains are being specialized in something other
 than what is happening with their typical peers  well  we took a construct from
  the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and you have physical height
 and weight well we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement 
 we sought children from the time they 're born what you see here on the
  their viewing time that they 're focusing on people 's eyes and this is their growth chart  
 they start over here they love people 's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit
 in those initial months now let 's see what 's happening with babies who became autistic 
 it 's something very different  it starts way up here  but then it 's a free fall
  very much like they brought into this world the reflex
 that orients them to people but it has no traction  it 's almost as if that stimulus you
 you 're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives
  wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life  because if you interact with a two and a three month old you 'd be surprised by how social those babies are 
 and what we see in the first six months of life
 is that those two groups can be segregated
 very easily  and using these kinds of measures and many others  what we found out is that our science
 could in fact  identify this condition early on we didn 't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life 
 if we measured things that are evolutionarily  highly conserved  
 and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way
 to those first months and that
 what we are doing now 
 now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children  
 but this would be for naught if we didn 't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community 
 now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues  the primary care physicians
  who see every child
 and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice  because they have to see so many children  
 and we want to do that universally
 so that we don 't miss any child  but this would be immoral
 if we also did not have an infrastructure
  for intervention for treatment  we need to be able to work with the families support the families to manage
 those first years with them we need to be able to really go from universal screening
 to universal access to treatment  because those treatments
 are going to change these children 's and those families  ' lives  now
  when we think about what we [ can ] do
 in those first years i can tell you
  having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense
 that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities preventing in fact those experiences
 that i really started in my journey in this field i thought at the time that this was an
  intractable condition no longer  we can do a great deal of things 
 and the idea is not to cure autism that 's not the idea 
 what we want is to make sure
 that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times  
 the profound intellectual disabilities  the lack of language  the profound profound isolation
 we feel that individuals with autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity  
 and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength  predictable situations situations that can be defined  because after all 
 they learn about the world almost like about it
  than learning how to function in it  but this is a strength
 if you 're working for example in technology  
 and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities  we want them to be free to do that we want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able
 not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise  well thank you for listening to me
