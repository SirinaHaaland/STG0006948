  when i 'm starting talks like this i usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don 't know what that is this is a crowd that does know what it
 small planet right picture a little earth circling around the sun you know about a million years ago a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees got a little clever harnessed fire invented the printing press made you know luggage with wheels on it and  you know built the society that we now live in  
 unfortunately while this society is without a doubt the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created it 's got some major major flaws
 one of them is that every society has an ecological footprint it has an amount of impact on the planet that 's measurable how much stuff goes through your life 
 how much waste is left behind you 
 and we at the moment in our society have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this we 're using up about five planets
  on the planet lived the way we did we 'd need between five six seven some people even say ten planets to make it 
 clearly we don 't have ten planets again you know  mental  visual ten planets one planet ten planets one planet right  
 we don 't have that so
 that 's one problem the second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways
  north americans such as myself you know we 're basically sort of wallowing gluttonous hogs and we 're eating all sorts of stuff and you know  then you get all the way down to people who live in the 
  asia pacific region or even more africa and people simply do not have enough to survive  this is producing all sorts of tensions all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing  
 and
 there 's more and more people on the way 
  this is what the planet 's going to look like in twenty years it 's going to be a pretty crowded place at least eight billion people so to
 make matters even more difficult  it 's a very young planet a third of the people on this planet are kids  
 and those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did no matter where they live they 've been exposed to this idea of our society of our prosperity  
 and they may not want to live exactly like us they may not want to be americans or brits or germans
  or south africans but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous and more dynamic and more  you know enjoyable and all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet  
 and if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque 
 we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly facing situations which are simply unthinkable
  everybody in this room has heard the worst case scenarios i don 't need to go into that but i will ask the question what 's the alternative 
 and i would say that at the moment the alternative is unimaginable you
 know so on the one hand we have the unthinkable on the other hand we have the unimaginable we don 't know yet
 how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable  which is shareable with everybody on the planet  which promotes stability
 and democracy and human rights  and which is achievable in the time frame necessary to make it through the challenges we face we don 't know how to do this yet 
 so what 's worldchanging well  worldchanging
 you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future 
 you know what we 're out there doing is looking for examples of tools models and ideas
  widely adopted would change the game
 a lot of times when i do a talk like this i talk about things that everybody in this room i 'm sure has already heard of but most people haven 't 
 so i thought today i 'd do something a little different and talk about what we 're looking for rather than saying  you know rather than giving you tried and true examples talk about the kinds of things we 're scoping out give you a little peek into our editorial notebook  
 and given that i have thirteen minutes
  to do this this is going to go kind of quick so i don 't know just stick with me right so first of all what are we looking for bright green city 
 one of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities we 're already an urban planet that 's especially true in the developed world 
 and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous and thus use a lot of stuff if we can change the dynamic by first of all creating cities that are denser
  and more livable here for example is vancouver which if you haven 't been there you ought to go for a visit it 's a fabulous city  and they are doing density new density better than probably anybody else on the planet right now  they 're actually managing to talk north americans out of driving cars  which is a pretty great thing 
 so you have density you also have growth management you leave aside what is natural to be natural this is in portland
  that is an actual development that land there will remain pasture in perpetuity  they 've bounded the city with a line nature city nothing changes
  once you do those things you can start making all sorts of investments you can start doing things like you know 
 transit systems that actually work to transport people in effective and reasonably comfortable manners you can also start to change what you build this is the beddington zero energy development 
 in london which is one of the greenest buildings in the world it 's a fabulous place we 're able to now build buildings that
  generate all their own electricity  that recycle much of their water that are much more comfortable than standard buildings use all natural light etc and over time cost less 
 green roofs  bill mcdonough covered that last night so i won 't dwell on that too much  but once you also have people living in close proximity to each other one of the things you can do is as information technologies develop
 you can start to have smart places you can start to know where
  things are when you know where things are it becomes easier to share them when you share them you end up using less  so one great example is car share clubs which are really starting to take off in 
  the u s have already taken off in many places in europe and are a great example if you 're somebody who drives you know one day a week do you really need your own car 
 monitoring the amount we 're actually using so here 's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use which i think is a pretty cool concept although i think it ought to work the other way around 
 that it gets brighter the more you don 't use but you know there may even be a simpler approach we could just re label things this light switch that reads on the one hand flashfloods  and on the other hand off 
 how we build things can change as well
 inspiration in form from life many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful and also much more effective  
 this is an example of bio mimicry which is something we 're really starting to look a lot more for in this case you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan which is greatly more effective there 's a lot of this stuff happening it 's really pretty remarkable
 i encourage you to look on worldchanging if you 're into it we 're starting to cover this more and more
 there 's also 
 design where more and more we 're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry so this for example is hydrogen generating algae 
 so we have a model
 in potential an emerging model that we 're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in and turn them into bright green cities
  most of the people on the planet don 't live in the cites we live in  they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world  and there 's a statistic i often like to use which is that we 're adding a city 
  of seattle every four days a city the size of seattle to the planet every four days  i was giving a talk about two months ago and this guy who 'd done some work with the u n came up to me and was was really flustered and he said look you 've got that totally wrong it 's totally wrong  it 's every seven
  we 're adding a city the size of seattle every seven days  and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or i live in  
 most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly they don 't have existing infrastructure they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty  and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways   
 so what do we need in order to
 make developing nation megacities into bright green megacities well the first thing we need is
  need leapfrogging and this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere the idea behind leapfrogging is that if you are a person or a country who is stuck in a situation where you don 't have the tools and technologies that you need 
 there 's no reason for you to invest in last generation 's technologies right that you 're much better off almost universally looking
  or locally applicable version of the newest technology 
 one place we 're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones right all throughout the developing world people are going directly to cell phones  skipping the whole landline stage 
 if there are landlines in many developing world cities they 're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money so i rather like this
  just permeating out through society we 've heard all about this here this week  so i won 't say too much more than that other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies 
 the second thing is tools for collaboration be they systems of collaboration  or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration  right  when you have
  solutions and those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don 't have capital  right  so  you know  we have open source software 
 we have creative commons and other kinds of copyleft solutions and those things lead to things like this this is a telecentro in sao paulo 
 this is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software  cheap sort of
 basically sort of abandoned buildings has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in get high speed internet access learn computer programming skills
 for free 
 and a quarter million people every year use these now in sao paulo and those quarter million people are some of the poorest people in sao paolo  i particularly like the little linux penguin in the back
  one of the things that that 's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion and one of the things we 're really really interested in at worldchanging is the ways in which the south is
  itself and 
  itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room so it 's not you know
 bollywood isn 't just answering hollywood  right  you know brazilian music scene isn 't just answering the major labels it 's doing something new there 's new
  things happening there 's interplay between them and you know 
 you get amazing things like  i don 't know if any of you have seen the movie city of god yeah   it 's a fabulous movie if you haven 't seen it and it 's all about this question in a very artistic and indirect kind of way 
 you have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out these are people who have just been visited by the internet bookmobile in uganda 
  think that 's a pretty cool picture  you know  
 so you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways
  in ways that haven 't happened before and as we heard last night as we 've heard earlier this week 
 are absolutely fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions is we 've got to craft new
  political realities and i would personally say that we have to craft new political realities not only in places like india afghanistan kenya pakistan what 
  have you but here at home as well  another world is possible and sort of the big
  imagine there being a different vague possibility out there but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility we need to start doing things like lula president of brazil how many people knew of lula before today
 ok so much much better than the average crowd i can tell you that so lula he 's full of problems full of
  but one of the things that he 's doing is he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations
 that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north south dialogue
 into a whole new way of
 global collaboration i would keep your eye on this fellow  
 another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call serious play we 're looking a lot at this this is spreading everywhere
  this is from a force more powerful it 's a little screenshot a force more powerful is a video game that while you 're playing it it teaches you how to engage in non violent insurrection and regime change 
 here 's another one this is from a game called food force which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp 
 these things are all contributing in a in a very dynamic way
 to a huge rise in especially
  in the developing world in
 people 's interest in and passion for democracy we get so little news about the developing world that we we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there 
  struggling to change things to be fairer freer more democratic less corrupt  
  together when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools
  you know second superpower stuff etc what do you get well  very quickly  you get a bright green future for the developing world  you get for example 
 green power spread throughout the world you get this is a building in hyderabad india it 's the greenest building in the world  you get grassroots solutions things that work for people who
  have no capital or limited access you get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains 
 you get access to distance medicine these are indian nurses learning how to use pdas to access databases that have information that they don 't have access to at home
 in a distant manner  
 you get new tools for people in the developing world these are led lights that help the the roughly billion people out there for whom nightfall means darkness 
  to have a new means of operating these are refrigerators that require no electricity they 're pot within a pot design  and you get water solutions water 's one of the most pressing problems here 's a design for harvesting rainwater that 's super cheap and available to people in the developing world here 's a
 design for distilling
 water using sunlight here 's a fog catcher which if you live in a
 moist jungle like area will distill water from the air that 's clean and drinkable here 's a way of transporting water i just love
  this you know i mean carrying water is such a drag and somebody just came up with the idea of well what if you rolled it right  i mean that 's a great design  this is
 a fabulous invention lifestraw  basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips  so you know people who are in desperate straits 
  can get this  this is one of my favorite worldchanging kinds of things ever  this is a merry go round invented by the company roundabout which
 pumps water as kids play you know
 seriously give that one a hand it 's pretty great
 and the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis right we 're expecting to have upwards of two hundred million refugees
 by the year two thousand and twenty because of climate change and political instability how do we help people like that well there 's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet
  some of those designs include models for acting such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps new models for pedagogy for the displaced and we have new tools 
  this is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere does anyone know what this is audience it detects landmines alex steffen 
  flower if you are living in one of the places where the roughly half billion unaccounted for mines are scattered
  you can fling these seeds out into the field and as they grow up they will grow up around the mines their roots will detect the chemicals in them  and where the flowers turn red you don 't step
  yeah  so seeds that could save your life you know i also love it because it seems to me
 that the example
  the tools we use to change the world  ought to be beautiful in themselves you know 
 that it 's not just enough to survive we 've got to make something better than what we 've got 
 and i think that we will just to wrap up in the immortal words of h g wells i think that better things are on the way i think that in
  all of the past is but the beginning
 of a beginning 
 all that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening 
 i hope that that turns out to be true the people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will thank you very much
