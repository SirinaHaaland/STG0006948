  a saturday afternoon in may  and
 i suddenly realized that the next day was mother 's day and i hadn 't gotten anything for my mom  so i started thinking about
 what should i get my mom for mother 's day  i thought why don 't i make her an interactive mother 's day card
 using the scratch software that i 'd been developing with my research group at the mit media lab 
 we developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations  
 and then share their creations with one another  
 so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch
 to make an
  interactive card for my mom before making my own mother 's day card i thought i would take a look
 at the scratch website  so over the last several years kids around the world ages eight and up have shared their projects 
 and i thought i wonder if of those three million projects whether anyone else has thought to put up mother 's day cards  
 so in the search box i typed in mother 's day
 and i was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of mother 's day cards that showed up on the scratch website 
 many of them just in the past twenty four hours by procrastinators just like myself  
 so i started taking a look at them 
 i saw one of them that featured a kitten
 and her mom and wishing her mom a happy mother 's day
 and the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom 
 another one was an interactive project where when you moved the mouse over the letters of happy mom day it reveals a special happy mother 's day slogan 
 music in
  the creator told a narrative about how she had googled to find out when mother 's day was happening 
 typing and then once she found out when mother 's day was happening she delivered a special mother 's day greeting of how much she loved her mom
 so i really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects in fact i liked it so much that instead of making my own project 
 i sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects
 and actually she reacted exactly the way that i hoped that she would she wrote back to me and she said i 'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother 's day cards for their mothers 
 so my mom was happy  and that made me happy  but actually
 i was even happier for another reason i was happy because these kids were using
  scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would
 as they created their interactive mother 's day cards  you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies 
 what do i mean by fluent 
 i mean that they were able to start expressing themselves
 and to start expressing their ideas
  when you become fluent with language  it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend  
 and it 's similar with new technologies
  by writing be creating these interactive mother 's day cards these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies  
 now maybe you won 't be so surprised by this  
  a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology i
 mean all of us have heard young people referred to as digital natives 
 but actually i 'm sort of skeptical about this term  i 'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives  
 when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies  you often see them in situations like this  
 or like this  
 and there 's no doubt
  that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing
 and chatting and texting and gaming but that doesn 't really make you fluent so
 young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies 
  a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies  
 it 's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies 
 and i 'm really interested in seeing how can we help young people become fluent
 so they can write with new technologies and that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs or code
  people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code you know in recent years there have been
 hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code  
 you look online you 'll see places like codecademy
 and events like coderdojo and sites like girls who code  or black
  it seems that everybody is getting into the act you know just at the beginning of this year at the turn of the new year new york city mayor michael bloomberg
 made a new year 's resolution that he was going to learn to code in two thousand and twelve a few months later the country of estonia decided that
 all of its first graders should learn to code  and that triggered a debate in the u k about whether all the children there should learn to code
  now for some of you when you hear about this  it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code  
 when many people think of coding they think of it as something
 that only a very narrow sub community of people are going to be doing and they think of coding looking like this  and in fact if this is what coding is
  it will only be a narrow sub community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background
 that can code  but coding doesn 't have to be like this  let me show you about what it 's like to code in scratch  
 so in scratch to code you just snap blocks together in this case you take a move block snap it into a stack and the stacks of blocks
 control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story in this case controlling
  big fish  
 after you 've created your program 
 you can click on share 
 and then share your project with other people so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well 
 so of course making a fish game isn 't the only thing you can do with scratch of the millions of projects on the scratch website there 's everything from animated stories
 to school science projects
  to anime soap operas
 to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls
 to trigonometry tutorials
 to interactive artwork and yes interactive mother 's day cards  
 so i think there 's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this to be able to take
  ideas and share their ideas with the world and it doesn 't just stay on the screen you can also code to interact with the physical world around you  
 here 's an example from hong kong where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device
 and had a light sensor so the light sensor detects the hole in the
  so as they move the physical saw the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen
 and saws down the tree we 're going to continue to look at new ways of
 bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us this is an example from a new version of scratch that we 'll be releasing
 in the next few months and
  be able to push you in new directions  here 's an example it uses the webcam  
 and as i move my hand  i can pop the balloons
 or i can move the bug
 so it 's a little bit like microsoft kinect where you interact with gestures in the world 
 but instead of just playing someone else 's game you get to create the games and if you see someone else 's game you can just say
  inside and
 you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it so there 's a new block that says how much video motion there is and then 
 if there 's so much video motion it will then tell the balloon to pop 
 the same way that this uses the camera
 to get information into scratch  you can also use the microphone  here 's an example of a project using the
  microphone  so i 'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices
  kids are creating projects like this they 're learning to code  but
  even more importantly they 're coding to learn  because as they learn to code  it enables them
 to learn many other things opens up many new opportunities for learning again it 's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing  
 when you learn to read and write  it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things  when you learn to read you can then
  the same thing with coding if you learn to code you can code to learn now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious you learn more about how computers work  
 but that 's just where it starts  when you learn to code  it opens up for you to learn many other things let me show you an example  
 here 's another project 
 and i saw this when i was visiting
 one of the computer clubhouses these are after school learning centers that we helped start
 that help young people from low income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies 
 and when i went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago  i saw a 13 year old boy who was using our scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one  
 and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game 
 but also he wanted to do more he wanted to keep score
  was a game where the big fish eats the little fish  but he wanted to keep score  so that each time the big fish eats the little fish 
 the score would go up and it would keep track and he didn 't know how to do that so i showed him 
 in scratch  you can create something called a variable
  call it score  
 and that creates some new blocks for you and also creates
 a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score  so each time i click on 
 change score it increments the score  so i showed this to the clubhouse member
 let 's call him victor and victor when he saw that this block would let him increment the score he knew exactly what to do he took the block
 and he put
  it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish  
 so then each time the big fish eats the little fish  he will increment the score  and the score
 will go up by one  and it 's in fact working and he saw
  and he was so excited he reached his hand out to me and he said thank you thank you thank you 
 and what went through my mind was how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables 
 it doesn 't happen in most classrooms  but that 's because in most classrooms when kids learn about variables
  they don 't know why they 're learning it it 's nothing that really they can make use of when you learn ideas like this in scratch  you can learn it in a way that 's really meaningful and
  motivating for you that you can understand the reason for learning variables  and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better victor
 had i 'm sure been taught about variables in schools but he really didn 't he wasn 't paying attention now he had a reason for learning variables  
 so when you learn through coding  and coding to learn
 you 're learning it in a meaningful
  and that 's the best way of learning things  
 so as kids like victor are creating projects like this  they 're learning important concepts like variables  but that 's just the start 
 as victor worked on this project
 and created the scripts he was also learning about the process of design how to start with the glimmer of an idea
 and turn it into a fully fledged functioning project like
  so he was learning many different
 core principles of design 
 about how to experiment with new ideas how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts how to collaborate with other people on your projects 
 about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong 
 how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren 't working well  
 now those are important skills that
  for coding they 're relevant for all sorts of different activities  
 now who knows if victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist it 's probably not so likely  
 but regardless of what he does  he 'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer 
 that these ideas are useful for everybody
  again it 's useful to think about this analogy with language  when you become fluent with reading and writing
  it 's not something that you 're doing just to become a professional writer very few people become professional writers 
 but it 's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write again the same thing with coding most people won 't grow up to become professional
  computer scientists or programmers but those skills of thinking creatively reasoning systematically working collaboratively skills you develop when you code in scratch
 are things that
 people can use no matter what they 're doing in their work lives and it 's not just about your work life coding can also enable you to
 express your ideas and feelings in your personal life let me end with just one more example
 so this is an example that came from after i had sent
 the mother 's day cards to my mom she decided that she wanted to learn scratch  
 so she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday scratch card 
 now this project is not going to win any prizes for design and you can rest assured that my
  training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist  but working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about
 and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity
 and developing new ways of expressing herself  so
 as we take a look and we see that michael bloomberg is learning to code  all of
  the children of estonia learn to code  even my mom has learned to code don 't you think it 's about time that you might be thinking about learning to code  
 if you 're interested in giving it a try  i 'd encourage you to go to the scratch website it
