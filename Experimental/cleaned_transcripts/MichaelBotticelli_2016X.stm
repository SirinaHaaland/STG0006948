  i was a broken man  and you probably wouldn 't be able to tell that if you met me i had a good job
 at a well respected academic institution  i dressed well of course  but my insides were rotting away
 you see i grew up in a family riddled with addiction  
 and as a kid i also struggled with coming to terms with my own sexuality  and even though i couldn 't name it then growing up as a gay kid
 just compounded my issues of isolation and insecurities  but drinking took all of that away
  like many i drank at an early age  i continued to drink my way through college  
 and when i finally did come out in the early 1980s about the only places to meet other gay people to socialize 
 to be yourself were gay bars 
 and what do you do in gay bars  you drink  and i did
 a lot my story is not unique
  like millions of americans my disease progressed undiagnosed it took me to people and places and things that i never would have chosen
 it wasn 't until an intersection with the law gave me an opportunity to get care 
 that i began my journey of recovery
 my journey of recovery has been filled with love and with joy  but it hasn 't been without
  pain like many of you i 've lost too many friends and family to this disease  i 've heard too many heartbreaking stories of people who 've lost loved ones to addiction  
 and i 've also lost countless friends
 to hiv and aids our current opioid epidemic and the aids epidemic tragically have much in common 
 right now we are in the midst of one of the greatest health crises of our time
 during two thousand and fourteen alone twenty eight thousand people died of drug overdoses associated with prescription drugs
 and heroin 
 during the 1980s scores of people were dying from hiv and aids 
 public officials ignored it  
 some wouldn 't even utter the words 
 they didn 't want
  treatment  and tragically there are many parallels with our current epidemic  
 some called it the gay plague  they called for quarantines 
 they wanted to separate the innocent victims from the rest of us 
 i was afraid we were losing this battle because people were blaming us for being sick public policy was being
  held hostage by stigma and fear  and also held hostage were compassion care  research recovery
 and treatment  but we changed all that 
 because out of the pain of those deaths we saw a social and political movement aids galvanized us
 into action
  to stand up to speak up
 and to act out and it also galvanized the lgbt movement 
 we knew we were in a battle for our lives because silence equaled death  
 but we changed  and we made things happen and right now  we have the potential to see the end of hiv aids in our lifetime
  these changes came in no small part by the courageous  yet simple decision for people to come out
 to their neighbors to their friends to their families
 and to their coworkers 
 years ago i was a volunteer for the names project this was an effort started by cleve jones in san francisco
 to show that people who died of aids had names
 and faces and families and people who loved them  
 i still recall unfolding the aids memorial quilt on the national mall
  so fast forward to two thousand and fifteen 
 the supreme court 's decision to strike down the ban on same sex marriage 
 my husband dave and i walk over to the steps of the supreme court to celebrate that decision with so many other people and i couldn 't help but think
 how far we came around lgbt rights and yet how far
 we needed to go around issues of addiction  
 when i was nominated by president obama to be his director of drug policy  i was very open about my recovery and about the fact that i was a gay man 
 and at no point during my confirmation process at least that i know of
 did the fact that i was a gay man
 come to bear on my candidacy or my fitness to do this job but
  addiction did 
 at one point a congressional staffer said that there was no way that i was going to be confirmed by the united states senate because of my past 
 despite the fact that i had been in recovery for over twenty years 
 and despite the fact that this job takes a little bit of knowledge around addiction 
  you know this is the stigma that people with substance use disorders face every single day  
 and you know i have to tell you it 's still why i 'm more comfortable coming out as a gay man than i am as a person with a history of addiction  
 nearly every family in america is affected by addiction  
 yet unfortunately too often it 's not talked about openly and honestly 
 it 's whispered about
  met with derision and scorn  
 we hear these stories time and time again on tv  online  
 we hear it from public officials and we hear it from family and friends
 and those of us with an addiction we hear those voices  and somehow we believe that we are less deserving
  of care and treatment  today in the united states only one in nine people
 get care and treatment for their disorder one in nine think about that 
 generally people with other diseases get care and treatment if you have cancer you get treatment if you
 have diabetes you get treatment if you have a heart attack you get emergency services and you get referred to care  
 but somehow people with addiction have to wait for treatment or often can 't get when
  they need it 
 and left untreated addiction has significant dire consequences  and for many people that means death or incarceration  
 we 've been down that road before for too long our country felt like we could arrest our way out of this problem  
 but we know that we can 't 
 decades of scientific research has shown that this is a medical issue
  that this is a chronic medical condition
 that people inherit
 and that people develop  
 so the obama administration has taken a different tack on drug policy  
 we 've developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to expand prevention services treatment services early intervention and recovery
  we 've pushed criminal justice reform  
 we 've knocked down barriers to give people second chances  we see public health and public safety officials working hand in hand at the community level  
 we see police chiefs across the country guiding people to treatment instead of jail and incarceration  
 we see law enforcement and other first responders reversing overdoses with naloxone to give people a second chance for care 
 the affordable care act
 is the biggest expansion of substance use disorder treatment in a generation  
 and it also calls for the integration of treatment services within primary care  
 but fundamentally  
 all of this work is not enough  unless we change the way that we view people with addiction
  years ago when i finally understood that i had a problem
 and i knew that i needed help  i was too afraid to ask for it 
 i felt that people would think i was stupid that i was weak willed 
 that i was morally flawed  
 but i talk about my recovery because i want to make change 
 i want us to see that we need to be open and candid about who
  we are and what we can do i am public about my own recovery not to be 
 i am open about my own recovery to change public opinion to change public policy
 and to change the course of this epidemic and empower the millions of americans who struggle with this journey to be open and candid about who they are
  than their disease  and all of us have the opportunity to change public opinion
 and to change public policy 
 all of us know someone who has an addiction  
 and all of us can do our part to change how we view people with addiction in the united states  so when you see someone with an addiction
  think of a drunk or a junkie or an addict or an abuser
 see a person 
 offer them help  give them kindness and compassion  
 and together we can be part of a growing movement in the united states to change how we view people with addiction  
 together we can change public policy  we can ensure that people get care when they need it just like any other disease
 we can be part of a growing unstoppable movement
 to have millions of americans enter recovery and put an end to this epidemic thank you very much
