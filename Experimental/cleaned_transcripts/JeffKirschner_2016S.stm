  this story starts with these two
 my kids we were hiking in the oakland woods when my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek she looked at me and said 
  that doesn 't go there when she said that it reminded me of summer camp 
 on the morning of visiting day right before they 'd let our anxious parents come barreling through the gates our camp director would say quick  everyone pick up five pieces of litter 
 you get a couple hundred kids each picking up five pieces and pretty soon you 've got a much cleaner camp  
 so i thought  why not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model
 to the entire planet  and that was the inspiration for
  the vision is to create a litter free world let me show you how it started i took a picture of a cigarette using instagram 
 then i took another photo  
 and another photo  and another photo and i noticed two things one litter became artistic and approachable  
 and two at the end of a few days i had fifty photos on my phone and i had picked up each piece and i realized
  that i was keeping a record of the positive impact
 i was having on the planet that 's fifty less things that you might see or you might step on or some bird might eat so i started telling people what i was doing  
 and they started
 participating one day  this photo showed up
  was more than just pretty pictures we were becoming a community that was collecting data 
 each photo tells a story it tells us who picked up what a geotag tells us where
 and a time stamp tells us when so
 i built a google map and started plotting the points where pieces were being picked up and through that process the community grew
  and the data grew my two kids go to school right in that bullseye 
 litter it 's blending into the background of our lives but what if we brought it to the forefront 
 what if we understood exactly what was on our streets our sidewalks
 and our school yards how might we use that data
 to make a difference  well let me show you the first is with
  cities 
 san francisco wanted to understand what percentage of litter was cigarettes  why to create a tax  
 so they put a couple of people in the streets with pencils and clipboards who walked around collecting information which led to a 20 cent tax on all cigarette sales  
 and then they got sued
 by big tobacco who claimed that collecting information with pencils and clipboards
  is neither precise
 nor provable 
 the city called me and asked if our technology could help i 'm
 not sure they realized that our technology was my instagram account but i said yes we can 
 and we can tell you if that 's a parliament or a pall mall plus  every photograph is
  five thousand pieces later our data was used in court to not only defend
 but double the tax  generating an annual recurring revenue of four million dollars
 for san francisco to clean itself up 
 now during that process i learned two things one instagram is not the right tool 
 so we built an app  and two if you think about it  every city in the world
 has a unique
 litter fingerprint and that fingerprint provides both the source of the problem and the path to the solution 
 if you could generate a revenue stream just by understanding the percentage of cigarettes well what about coffee cups
 or soda cans or plastic bottles 
  you could fingerprint san francisco well how about oakland
 or amsterdam
 or somewhere much closer to home 
 and what about brands how might they use this data to align their environmental and economic interests 
 there 's a block in downtown oakland that 's covered in blight the litterati community got together and picked up one thousand five hundred pieces
  and here 's what we learned most of that litter came from a very well known taco brand 
 most of that brand 's litter were their own hot sauce packets and most of those hot sauce packets
 hadn 't even been opened 
 the problem
 and the path to the solution well maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request
 or installs bulk dispensers or comes up with more sustainable packaging how does a brand take an
  environmental hazard turn it into an economic engine and become an industry hero 
 if you really want to create change there 's no better place to start than with our kids a
 group of fifth graders picked up one thousand two hundred and forty seven pieces of litter just on their school yard  
 and they learned that the most common type of litter were the plastic straw wrappers from their own cafeteria 
 so these kids went to their principal and asked
 why are we still buying straws 
 and they stopped  
 and they learned that individually they could each make a difference  but together they created an impact 
 it doesn 't matter if you 're a student or a scientist  whether you live in honolulu or hanoi  this is a community
  started because of two little kids in the northern california woods and today it 's spread across the world and you know how we 're getting there  
 one piece at a time
