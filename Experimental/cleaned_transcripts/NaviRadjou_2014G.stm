  when you grow up in a developing country like india  as i did you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources
 and find creative ways to reuse what you already have take mansukh prajapati
  a potter in india  he has created
 a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity  he can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days 
 that 's a cool invention literally 
 in africa if you run out of your cell phone battery don 't panic you will find some resourceful
  entrepreneurs who can recharge your cell phone using bicycles  and since we are in south america  
 let 's go to lima in peru 
 a region with high humidity that receives only one inch of rainfall each year
  an engineering college in lima
 designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs
  air humidity
 and converts it into purified water generating over ninety liters of water every day  
 the peruvians are amazing they can literally create water out of thin air 
 for the past seven years i have met and studied
  and they keep amazing me 
 many of them did not go to school  they don 't invent stuff in big r & d labs  the street
 is the lab why do they do that because they don 't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted  like
  and basic services like healthcare and education are also scarce in those regions 
 when external resources are scarce  
 you have to go within yourself to tap the most abundant resource human ingenuity and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources 
  we call it
 jugaad 
 jugaad is a hindi word that means an improvised fix a clever solution born in adversity 
 jugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect  but they create more value at lower cost 
 for me the entrepreneurs who will create jugaad solutions are like alchemists they can magically transform adversity into opportunity
  and turn something of less value into something of high value 
 in other words they mastered the art of doing more
 with less  which is the essence of frugal innovation  
 frugal innovation is the ability to create more economic and social value
 using fewer resources
 frugal innovation is not about making do it 's about making things better 
 now i want to show you how across emerging markets 
 entrepreneurs and companies are adopting frugal innovation on a larger scale
 to cost effectively deliver
  to billions of people who may have little income
 but very high aspirations  let 's first go to china  
 where the country 's largest i t service provider neusoft has developed a telemedicine solution
 to help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients in chinese villages  this solution is
  medical devices that less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics 
 china desperately needs these frugal medical solutions because by two thousand and fifty it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens 
 now
 let 's go to kenya a country where half the population
  a mobile payment solution this is a great solution for the african continent
 because eighty percent of africans don 't have a bank account  but what is exciting
 is that m pesa is now becoming the source of other disruptive business models in sectors like energy 
 take m kopa the home solar solution that comes literally in a box that has
 a solar rooftop panel three led lights
 a solar radio  and a cell phone charger  
 the whole kit though  costs two hundred dollars  which is too expensive for most kenyans 
 and this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable today you can buy this kit
 by making an initial deposit of just
  and then pay off the rest by making a daily micro payment of forty five cents using your mobile phone once you 've made three hundred 
 the system is unlocked and you own the product and you start receiving clean  free electricity  
 this is an amazing solution for kenya  where seventy percent of people live off the grid  
 this shows that
  frugal innovation what matters is that you take what is most abundant mobile connectivity to deal with what is scarce  which is energy 
 with frugal innovation  the global south is actually catching up and in some cases even leap frogging the north  
 instead of building
  instead of building banks and electricity grids is going straight to mobile payments and distributed clean energy  frugal innovation
 is diametrically opposed
 to the way we innovate in the north  i live in silicon valley  where we keep chasing the next big technology thing
  think of the iphone five  six  then seven eight  
 companies in the west spend billions of dollars investing in r & d  and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products 
 to differentiate their brands from competition  
 and they charge customers more money for new features 
 so the conventional business model in the west is
 more for more 
 but sadly  this more for more model is running out of gas for three reasons first 
 a big portion of customers in the west
 because of the diminishing purchasing power can no longer afford these expensive products  
 second we are running out of natural water and oil 
 in california where i live
 water scarcity is becoming a big problem and third most importantly 
 because of the growing income disparity between the rich and the middle class in the west there is a big disconnect between existing products and services and basic needs of customers 
 do you know that today  there are over seventy million americans
 today who are underbanked because existing
  banking services are not designed to address their basic needs the prolonged economic crisis in the west is making people think
 that they are about to lose the high standard of living and face deprivation  
 i believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the west
 is if we learn to do more with less the good news is
  that 's starting to happen  several western companies are now adopting frugal innovation
 to create affordable products for western consumers  let me give you two examples 
 when i first saw this building i told myself it 's some kind of postmodern house  actually it 's a small manufacturing plant
  set up by grameen danone 
 a joint venture between grameen bank of muhammad yunus and the food multinational danone to make high quality yogurt in bangladesh  
 this factory is ten percent the size of existing danone factories and cost much less to build 
 i guess you can call it a low fat factory  
 now this factory unlike western factories that are highly
  relies a lot on manual processes in order to generate jobs for local communities 
 danone was so inspired by this model that combines
 economic efficiency and social sustainability they are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well  
 now when you see this example you might be thinking well frugal innovation is low tech 
 actually no frugal innovation is also about making high tech more affordable and more
  accessible to more people let me give you an example 
 in china  the r & d engineers of siemens healthcare have designed a c t scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers like nurses and technicians  
 this device can scan more patients on a daily basis  and yet consumes less energy  
 which is great for hospitals  but it 's also great for
  patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by thirty percent and radiation dosage by up to sixty percent 
 this solution was initially designed for the chinese market  but now it 's selling like hotcakes in the u s and europe  where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality
  but the frugal innovation revolution
 in the west is actually led by creative entrepreneurs who are coming up with amazing solutions to address basic needs in the u s and europe  let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me  
 the first one happens to be launched by my neighbor in silicon valley  it 's called gthrive 
 they make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers that farmers can
  stick in different parts of the field and start collecting detailed information like soil conditions  this dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy
 while improving quality of the products and the yields  which is a great solution for california which faces major water shortage 
 it pays for itself within one year  
 second example is
  in silicon valley  that enables you to connect to the internet even in  no bandwidth areas where there 's no wi fi or 3g or 4g how do they do that 
 they simply use sms a basic technology  but that happens to be the most reliable and most widely available around the world three billion people
  with cell phones can 't access the internet this solution can connect them to the internet in a frugal way 
 and in france  there is a startup calle compte nickel which is revolutionizing the banking sector 
 it allows thousands of people to walk into a mom and pop store and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products an international bank account number
 and an international debit card they charge a flat annual maintenance fee of just twenty euros
 that means you can do all banking transactions send and receive money pay with your debit card all with no additional charge this is what i call low cost banking without the bank amazingly
  percent of the customers using this service are the middle class french who can 't afford high banking fees
  i talked about frugal innovation  initially pioneered in the south now being adopted in the north
 ultimately we
 would like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity  
 the exciting news is that 's starting to happen  
 let 's go to nairobi to find that out nairobi has horrendous traffic jams  when i first saw them i
 because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in nairobi to ease the situation  the engineers at the ibm lab in kenya
 are piloting a solution called megaffic which initially was designed by the japanese engineers  
 unlike in the west megaffic doesn 't rely on roadside sensors which are very expensive to install in nairobi
  instead they process images traffic data  collected from a small number of
  webcams in nairobi streets  and then they use analytic software to predict congestion points  and they can sms drivers alternate routes to take 
 granted megaffic is not as sexy as
  to take nairobi drivers from point a to point b at least twenty percent faster  
 and earlier this year  ucla health launched its global lab for innovation 
 which seeks to identify frugal healthcare solutions anywhere in the world that will be at least twenty percent cheaper than existing
  and yet more effective 
 it also tries to bring together innovators from north and south to cocreate affordable healthcare solutions for all of humanity  
 i gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world but the question is 
 how do you go about adopting frugal innovation well i gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world that i want to share with you that you can apply in your own organization
 to do more with less  
 the first principle is keep it simple 
 don 't create solutions to impress customers make them easy enough to use and widely accessible like the c t scanner we saw in china  
 second principle do not reinvent the wheel  try to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available
  like using mobile telephony to offer clean energy or mom and pop stores to offer banking services 
 third principle is  think and act horizontally  
 companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses  but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity 
 you need to scale out horizontally
 using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units like grameen bank has shown 
 the south pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity  
 the north is now learning to do more and better with less
 as it faces resource
  french national who lives in the united states my hope is that we transcend this artificial
 divide so that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world
 to cocreate frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world while preserving our precious planet  thank you very much
