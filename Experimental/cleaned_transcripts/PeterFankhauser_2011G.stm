  let me introduce to you rezero this little fellow was developed by a group of ten undergraduate students at the autonomous systems laboratory at 
  robot belongs to a family
  of robots called ballbots
 instead of wheels a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball 
 the main characteristics of such a system is that there 's one sole contact point to the ground  this means that the robot is inherently unstable it
 's like when i am trying to stand on one foot 
 you might ask yourself what 's the usefulness of a robot that 's unstable  now we 'll explain that in a second 
  let me first explain how rezero actually keeps his balance rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor 
 he then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately 
 this happens one hundred and sixty times per second and if anything fails in this process rezero would immediately fall to the ground 
 now to move and to balance rezero needs to turn the ball
  the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time 
 due to his instability rezero is always in motion now here 's the trick  
 it 's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [ dynamically ] 
 let 's play a little you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot
  's trying to maintain his position 
 for the next demo i 'd like you to introduce to my colleagues michael on the computer and thomas who 's helping me onstage 
 in the next mode  rezero is passive and we can move him around 
 with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity
 can also make him spin
 in the next mode  we can get rezero to follow a person  
 he 's now keeping a constant distance to thomas
 this works with a laser sensor that 's mounted on top of rezero 
 with the same method we can also get him to circle a person 
 we call this the
  what 's the use of this technology
  for now it 's an experiment  but let me show you some possible future applications
  rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way 
 in a hospital this device could be used to carry around medical equipment 
 due to the ballbot system it has a very small footprint and it 's also easy to move around and of course who wouldn 't like to take a ride on one of these
  these are more practical applications  but there 's also a certain beauty within this technology
  and
