  i 'm a lifelong traveler even as a little kid i was actually working out
 that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in england than just to the best school down the road from my parents
  from the time i was nine years old i was flying alone several times a year
 over the north pole just to go to school  
 and of course the more i flew the more i came to love to fly 
 so the very week after i graduated from high school i got a job mopping tables so that i could spend every season of my
  inevitably  i became a travel writer so my job and my joy
 could become one  
 and i really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of tibet or to wander along the seafronts in havana with music passing all around you 
 you could bring those sounds and the high cobalt skies and the flash of
  the blue ocean back to your friends at home  and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life
  except  as you all know  one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical
 unless you can bring the right eyes to it you take an angry man to the himalayas he just starts complaining about the food
 that the best way that i could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes
 was oddly by going nowhere just by sitting still  
 and of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives a break  
 but it was also the only way that i could find to sift through the slideshow
  of my experience and make sense of the future and the past  
 and so to my great surprise  i found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to tibet or to cuba  
 and by going nowhere i mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season or even as some people do a few
  years out of a life
 in order to sit still long enough
 to find out what moves you most to recall where your truest happiness lies
 and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions  and
  this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us it 's an old idea 
 more than two thousand years ago the stoics were reminding us it 's not our experience that makes our lives it 's what we do with it  
 imagine a hurricane suddenly sweeps through your town
 and reduces every last thing to rubble 
 one man is traumatized for life but another maybe even his brother
  almost feels liberated and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew it 's exactly the same event but radically different responses 
 there is nothing either good or bad as shakespeare told us in hamlet but thinking makes it so  
 and this has certainly been my experience as a traveler twenty four years ago i took the most
  north korea  
 but the trip lasted a few days 
 what i 've done with it sitting still going back to it in my head trying to understand it  finding a place for it in my thinking 
 that 's lasted twenty four years already and will probably last a lifetime 
 the trip in other words  gave me some amazing
  but it 's only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights  
 and i sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads 
 in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation that if i really want to change my life
 i might best begin by changing my mind  again  none of this is new that 's why shakespeare and the stoics were telling us this centuries ago
  shakespeare never had to face two hundred emails in a day the stoics as far as i know  were not on facebook 
 we all know that in our on demand lives one of the things that 's most on demand is ourselves  wherever we are any time of night or day our bosses junk mailers our parents can get to us 
 sociologists have actually found that in recent
  years americans are working fewer hours than fifty years ago  but we feel as if we 're working more 
 we have more and more time saving devices but sometimes it seems  less and less time 
 we can more and more easily make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet  but sometimes in that process
 we lose contact with ourselves
  of my biggest surprises as a traveler has been to find that often it 's exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere
 who are intent on going nowhere in other words precisely those beings who have created the technologies
 that override so many of the limits of old are the ones wisest about the need for limits even when it comes to
  technology  
 i once went to the google headquarters and i saw all the things many of you have heard about the indoor tree houses the trampolines  
  workers at that time enjoying twenty percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering 
 one googler was telling me about the program that he was about to start to teach the many many googlers who practice yoga to become trainers in it 
 and the other googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write
 on the inner search engine and the ways in which science has empirically
  that sitting still or meditation can lead not just to better health or to clearer thinking but even to emotional intelligence  
 i have another friend in silicon valley who is really one of the most eloquent spokesmen for the latest technologies and in fact was one of the founders of wired magazine kevin kelly  
 and kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a tv in his home
  and like many in silicon valley he tries really hard to observe what they call
 an internet sabbath  whereby for
  hours every week they go completely offline
 in order to gather the sense of direction and proportion they 'll need when they go online again the one thing perhaps that technology hasn 't always given us
  is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology  
 and when you speak of the sabbath
  look at the ten commandments there 's only one word there for which the adjective holy is used 
 and that 's the sabbath  
 i pick up the jewish holy book of the torah its longest chapter
  it 's on the sabbath  and we all know that it 's really one of our greatest luxuries the empty space 
 in many a piece of music it 's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape  
 and i know i as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page
 so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences
 and so that her imagination has room to breathe
 in the physical domain of course many people if they have the resources  will try to get a place in the country a second home  
 i 've never begun to have those resources  
 but i sometimes remember that any time i want i can get a second home in time if not in space just by taking
  a day off 
 and it 's never easy because of course whenever i do i spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that 's going to crash down on me the following day 
 i sometimes think i 'd rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails 
 and every season i do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a
  friend 's birthday party  
 but as soon as i get to a place of real quiet 
 i realize that it 's only by going there that i 'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends 
 otherwise really i 'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness which is no blessing at all 
 and so when i was
 twenty nine i decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere  
 one evening i was coming back from the office it was after midnight i was in a taxi driving through times square  and i suddenly realized that i was racing around so much
 i could never catch up with my life and my life then as it happened was pretty much the one i might have dreamed of as a little
 i had really interesting friends and colleagues  i had a nice apartment on park avenue and 20th street  
 i had to me a fascinating job writing about world affairs  
 but i could never separate myself enough from them
 to hear myself think or really to understand if i was truly happy 
  i abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of kyoto japan 
 which was the place that had long exerted a strong really mysterious gravitational pull on me 
 even as a child i would just look at a painting of kyoto and feel i recognized it i knew it before i ever laid eyes on it 
 but it 's also
  as you all know a beautiful city encircled by hills filled with more than two thousand temples and shrines 
 where people have been sitting still for eight hundred years or more 
 and quite soon after i moved there i ended up where i still am
 with my wife formerly our kids in a two room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle no car no tv
 i can understand  
 and i still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement
 or for cultural excitement or for social diversion  but i realized that it gives me what i prize most 
 which is days
 and hours  i have never once had to use a cell phone there
  almost never have to look at the time and
 every morning when i wake up really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow  
 and when life throws up one of its nasty surprises as it will more than once 
 when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway i
  in my bones 
 that it 's the time i 've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time i 've spent racing around to bhutan or easter island
  i 'll always be a traveler my livelihood depends on it
 but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness
 into the motion and the commotion
  i once got on a plane in frankfurt germany  
 and a young german woman came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about thirty minutes  
 and then she just turned around
 and sat still
 for twelve hours  she didn 't once turn on her video monitor  she never pulled out a book she didn 't even go to sleep  she just sat
  and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me 
 i 've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives 
 some people go to black hole resorts where they 'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival
 some people i know  just before they go to sleep  instead of scrolling through their messages or checking
  out youtube just turn out the lights
 and listen to some music  and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed  
 i was once fortunate enough to drive into the high  dark mountains behind los angeles where
 the great poet and singer and international heartthrob leonard cohen was living and working for many
  years as a full time monk in the mount baldy zen center  
 and i wasn 't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of seventy seven 
 to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of old ideas 
 went to number one in the charts in seventeen nations in the world hit the top five in nine others 
 something in us i think is crying out
 for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that who take the time and trouble to sit still  
 and i think many of us have the sensation i certainly do 
 that we 're standing about two inches away from a huge screen  and it 's noisy and it 's crowded and it 's changing with every
  that screen is our lives  
 and it 's only by stepping back  and then further back  and holding still 
 that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture  and a few people do that for us
 by going nowhere
