  so my name is taylor wilson i am seventeen years old and i am a nuclear physicist which may be a little hard to believe but i am
  and i would like to make the case that
  nuclear fusion will be that point that the bridge that t boone pickens talked about will get us to so nuclear fusion is our energy future 
 and the second point making the case that kids can really change the world so
 you may ask 
 you may ask me well how do you know what our energy future is well i built a fusion reactor when i was fourteen years old 
 that is the inside of
  my nuclear fusion reactor  i started building this project when i was about twelve or thirteen years old i decided i wanted to make a star now most of you are probably saying   well
 there 's no such thing as nuclear fusion i don 't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy well it doesn 't break even it doesn 't produce more energy out than i put in but it still does some pretty cool stuff  and i assembled this
  my garage and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada reno  and it slams together deuterium which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it 
 so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that 's going on inside the sun  and i 'm slamming it together so hard that that that hydrogen fuses together and in the process it has some byproducts and i utilize those byproducts
 this previous year i won the intel international science and engineering fair  
 i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has for hundreds of dollars i 've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars
 i built this
  produce medical isotopes instead of requiring multi million dollar facilities i 've developed a device that on a very small scale can produce these isotopes so
 that 's my fusion reactor in the background there 
 that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor oh by the way i make yellowcake in my garage
 so my nuclear program is as advanced as the iranians so
 maybe i don 't want to admit to that 
 this is me at cern in geneva switzerland which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world  
 and this is me with president obama showing him my homeland security research 
 so in about seven years of doing nuclear research i started out with a dream to make a star in a jar
  jar a star in my garage  and i ended up meeting the president and developing things that i think can change the world and i think other kids can too  so thank you very much
