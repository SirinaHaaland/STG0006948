  your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door  encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new 
 but i bet there 's something you didn 't think about today something so close to home
 that you probably don 't think about it very often at all and that 's that all the sensations feelings
  decisions and actions
 are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain  
 now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh  amorphous
 but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain  and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they 've told us
 that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons
  now unlike a human designed computer where there 's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans designed them
 the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they 're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease
  a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors  
 it 's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia it 's called the basket cell  
 and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered everyday 
 as just a second example  these pyramidal cells  large cells they can
  a significant fraction of the brain they 're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be
 in disorders such as epilepsy  every one of these cells is an incredible
 electrical device 
 they receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs  which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of downstream partners and this process 
 which takes just a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your one hundred billion cells
  as you live and think
 and feel  so
 how are we going to figure out what this circuit does  ideally we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off
 and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies if
 we could activate cells we could see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we could turn them off then
  we could try and figure out what they 're necessary for and that 's a story i 'm going to tell you about today  
 and honestly where we 've gone through over the last eleven years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off  
 both to understand the science
 and also
 to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans  now before i
  bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room  if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder
 already a billion people have had
 some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don 't do it justice though 
 these disorders schizophrenia alzheimer 's depression addiction they not only steal our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and
  change who we are as people now
 in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated
 through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders  
 and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders  practically none of them can be considered to be cured  and part of that 's because
  we 're bathing the brain in the chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell
 is being bathed in a substance that 's also why  perhaps most of the drugs and not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too  
 now some people have gotten some solace from
 electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain  and
 for parkinson 's disease cochlear implants these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but
  electricity also will go in all directions the path of least resistance which is where that phrase in part comes from  
 and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we
 're sent back to the idea of ultra precise control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go 
 so when i started in neuroscience eleven years ago i had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist  and the first thing i thought about was
  if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance  if we could turn on the electricity in one cell  but not its neighbors 
 that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they 're embedded  and also it would allow us to have the ultra precise control we need
  going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature  which are able to convert light into electricity you can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells  
 if we can install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don 't have the molecule would not 
 there 's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen  and that 's the ability to get light into the brain  and to do that
 brain doesn 't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that 's gone into the internet and communications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate 
 in animal models for example in pre clinical studies these neurons and to see what they do  
 so how do we do this  around two thousand and four in collaboration with gerhard nagel and karl deisseroth
  vision came to fruition  there 's a certain alga
 that swims in the wild  and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally  
 and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our eye works  
 in its membrane or its boundary  it contains little proteins
 that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called channelrhodopsins 
 and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that i told you about when blue light hits it
  it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye spot and that allows this eye spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery  
 so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it 's a protein it 's encoded for in the dna of this organism 
 so all we 've got to do is take that dna put it into a gene therapy vector like a virus  
 and put it into neurons
  so it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be very simple to do and early in the morning
 one day in the summer of two thousand and four we gave it a try and it worked on the first try 
 you take this dna and you put it into a neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making machinery to fabricate these little
  proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof  
 and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so
 this is very powerful 
 one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors   and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others  and there 's other genetic tricks you can play
 in order to get light activated
  this field has now come to be known as optogenetics  
 and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex network 
 use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network  
 and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated  so for example lets sort of consider that basket cell i told you about earlier
 the one that 's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory  if we can deliver that gene to these cells and they 're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene of course and then
  flash blue light over the entire brain network just these cells are going to be driven  and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so they don 't seem to be averse against that 
 not only can you use this to study what these cells do what their power is in computing in the brain  but you can also use this to try to figure out well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells if indeed they 're atrophied 
 now i want to tell you a couple of short stories
 about how we 're using this  both at the scientific
  levels one of the questions we 've confronted
 is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward  because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that could drive learning  the brain will do more of whatever got that reward  and also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction  
 so if we could figure out what cells they are we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be
  or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability  
 so to do that we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the fiorella group 
 where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light  
 so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more 
 and so that 's what happens this animal 's going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that and he 'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons
  of you may have heard about in some of the pleasure centers in the brain  now we 've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning  
 now we can generalize the idea  
 instead of one point in the brain  we can devise devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source  
 and then we can try to do
  in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like high throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders  
 and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled
 anxiety and fear  
 and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back to the pavlovian days it 's called pavlovian fear conditioning
 where a tone
  ends with a brief shock the shock isn 't painful but it 's a little annoying  
 and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model  commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal will react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights  
 now the question is what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear  so what we do
 we play that tone again after it 's been associated with fear  but we activate targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber array i told you about in the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear  
 and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we 're working on now this is an area in the prefrontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states  and the animal 's going to hear a tone and a flash of light occurred there there 's no audio on this but you can see the animal 's freezing  this tone
 used to mean bad news and there 's a little clock in the
  see the animal is about two minutes into this  and now this next clip is just eight minutes later  and the same tone is going to play and the light is going to flash again 
 okay there it goes right
 now and now you can see just ten minutes into the experiment that we 've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression
  of this fear memory 
 now over the last couple of years we 've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off  if we could do that this could be extremely powerful  if you can delete 
 cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they 're embedded  and we 've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every kingdom of life except for animals we see slightly differently  
 called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins that respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule i told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin  
 let 's give an example of where we think this is going to go 
 consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is overactive 
 now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that 's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time until the seizure dies away
 the brain to be restored to its initial state sort of like a dynamical system that 's being coaxed down into a stable state 
 so this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light  and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure 
 we 're hoping to be able to turn it off and so we don 't have data to show you on this front  but we 're very excited about this  
 now i want to close on one story which we think
 is another possibility which is that maybe these
  molecules if you can do ultra precise control can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic i already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon
 seventy five thousand people have parkinson 's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe one hundred thousand people have cochlear implants which allow them to hear 
 there 's another thing which is you 've got to get these genes into cells and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the
  probably most of us around this room have and it doesn 't have any symptoms 
 which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body  and so far there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus  
 there 's one last elephant in the room  the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and fungi and all over the tree of life 
 most of us don 't have fungi or algae in our brains so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react
  its early days these have not been done on humans yet but we 're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven 't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to
 the illumination of the brain with light so it 's early days to be upfront but we 're excited about it 
 i wanted to close with one story  which we think could potentially
  many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye 
 are gone  and the retina of course is a complex structure now let 's zoom in on it here so we can see it in more detail  
 the photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom the ganglion cells  relay the information to the
  where we see that as perception  
 in many forms of blindness like retinitis pigmentosa  or macular degeneration  the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed 
 now how could you repair this it 's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there 's nothing for the drug to bind to on the
 other hand light can still get into the eye   the eye is still transparent and you can get light in  so what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other
  molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras  and because there 's so many of these cells in the eye  potentially they could be very  high resolution cameras  so
 this is some work that we 're doing it 's being
 led by one of our collaborators alan horsager at usc and being
 sought to be commercialized by a start up company eos neuroscience which is funded by the nih and what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it 's a six arm maze and there 's a bit of water in the maze to
  and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that 's under the lit top port  
 now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a brute force search he 's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he 's not using vision to do it 
 these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we 're being careful in trying to look at these different models
  going to solve this we 're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide we 're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera
 just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them  
 so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus  and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and
  to this little platform
 and make cognitive use of its eyes again  
 and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives so this pre clinical study i think bodes hope for the kinds of things we 're hoping to do
 in the future 
 to close i want to point out that we 're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology  we 're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world
 so people can study and try to treat different disorders  
 and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them 
 we can take some of these intractable disorders that i told you about earlier  practically none of which are cured  and in the 21st century make them history  thank you
  some of the stuff is a little dense 
 but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs  
 and being able to target those specifically
 is a first step the second thing that i think i heard you say is you
  can now control
 the brain in two colors  like an on off switch ed boyden that 's right je which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code eb 
 right yeah so with blue light we can drive information and it 's in the form of a one and by turning things off it 's more or less a zero so
 our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities je and in theory that means that
 as a mouse feels smells  hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros eb sure 
 yeah we 're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings  and use that to understand more about the brain je 
 does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe
  something we 're starting to work on very hard  we 're now working on
 some work where we 're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too  so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing je 
 well that might change a couple things  thank you
