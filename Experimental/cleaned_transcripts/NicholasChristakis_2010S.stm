  last ten years i 've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks and the kind of social network i 'm talking about is not the recent online variety  
 but rather the kind
 kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years  ever since we emerged from the african savannah so i form friendships and co worker and sibling 
  and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance and you get a network that looks like this 
  and my colleague james fowler and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical social biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled
 and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate how they affect our lives  
 but recently we 've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight to actually find ways to improve the world to do something better to actually fix things
  not just understand things 
 so one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics  
 and the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic if you 're the cdc or some other national body
 is to sit in the middle where you are and collect data from physicians and laboratories in the field that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions so so and so patients have been diagnosed with something
  or other patients have been diagnosed and all these data are fed into a central repository with some delay  and if everything goes smoothly one to two weeks from now you 'll know where the epidemic was today
 and actually about a year or so ago there was this promulgation of the idea of google flu trends with respect to the flu where
  by looking at people 's searching behavior today  we could know where the flu what the status of the epidemic was today what 's the prevalence of the   of the epidemic today  
 but what i 'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic  but also actually early detection of an epidemic and 
 in fact this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs  but
  to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds  
 for example anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism  or altruism  or 
  religion to practices like dieting behavior or book purchasing or drinking or bicycle helmet [ and ] other safety practices  or products that people might buy purchases of electronic
  anything in which there 's kind of an interpersonal spread a kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism i 'm going to show you now 
 so as all of you probably know 
 the classic way of thinking about this is the 
  the adoption curve  so here on the y axis we have the percent of the people affected  and on the x axis we have time and at the very beginning not too many people are
  and you get this classic sigmoidal or s shaped curve  
 and the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning let 's say one or two people are infected or affected by the thing and then they affect or infect two people who in turn affect four eight sixteen and so forth  and you get the epidemic growth
 phase of the curve  and eventually you saturate the population there are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect and then you get the plateau of the curve  and you get this classic sigmoidal curve  and this holds for germs
  ideas product adoption behaviors  and the like 
 but things don 't just diffuse in human populations at random they actually diffuse through networks  because as i said we live our lives in networks and these networks have a particular kind of a structure 
 now if you look at a network like this this is one hundred and five people and the
  lines represent the dots are the people and the lines represent friendship relationships you might see that people occupy different locations within the network 
 and there are different kinds of relationships between the people you could have friendship relationships sibling relationships  spousal relationships co worker relationships  
 neighbor relationships and the like 
 and different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties  for instance sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties  
 or  for instance people 's smoking behavior might be influenced by their
  friends  or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers or by their neighbors  
 but not all positions in the network are the same so if you look at this you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections  some people have one connection some have two some have six some have ten connections  and this is
  of a node or the number of connections that a node has 
 but in addition there 's something else  so if you look at nodes a and b they both have six connections  but if you can see this image [ of the network ] from a bird 's eye view you can appreciate that there 's something very different about nodes a and  b 
 so let me ask you this i can cultivate this intuition by asking a question who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network  a or
  it 's obvious  b is located on the edge of the network now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network 
 a and you have an immediate appreciation that a is going to be more likely to get the thing that 's spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location 
 within the network  a in fact is more central  and this can be formalized mathematically  
  we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network  including node a monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network and somehow get an early 
  detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network  so if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information you would know that soon enough everybody was about to contract this germ or this piece of information  and this would be much better
  monitoring six randomly chosen people  without reference to the structure of the population and
 in fact if you could do that what you would see is something like this on the left hand panel again we have the s shaped curve of adoption in the dotted red line we show what the adoption would be in the 
  random people and in the left hand line  shifted to the left  we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network  on the
  contagion and on the x axis is the time and on the right hand side we show the same data  but here with daily incidence and what we show here is like here very few people are affected more and more and more and up to here 
 and here 's the peak of the epidemic  but shifted to the left is what 's occurring in the central individuals  and this difference in time between the two is the early detection the early warning we can get about an impending epidemic in the human population
  however is that mapping human social networks is not always possible 
 it can be expensive not feasible  unethical or frankly  just not possible to do such a thing 
 so how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network 
 what we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact or a known fact about social networks
  which goes like this do you know that your friends have more friends than you do 
 your friends have more friends than you do and
 this is known as the friendship paradox imagine a very popular person in the social network like a party host who has hundreds of friends and a misanthrope who has just one friend  and you pick someone
  at random from the population  they were much more likely to know the party host and if they nominate the party host as their friend that party host has a hundred friends  therefore has more friends than they do  
 and this in essence is what 's known as the friendship paradox the friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree  and are more central than the random people themselves 
  and you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network  
  person who by construction must have at least two and typically more friends 
 and that happens at every peripheral node  and in fact it happens throughout the network as you move in everyone you pick when they nominate a random when a random person nominates a friend of theirs you move closer to the center of the network  
 so  we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks
  now with this idea we can take a random sample of people have them nominate their friends those friends would be more central and we could do this without having to map the network  
 and we tested this idea with an outbreak of h1n1 flu at harvard college
 in the fall and winter of two thousand and nine just a few months ago  we took one thousand three hundred randomly selected
  we had them nominate their friends and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic  and we did this passively by looking 
  at whether or not they 'd gone to university health services and also we had them [ actively ] email us a couple of times a week 
  and the difference in the two is sixteen days by monitoring the friends group we could get sixteen days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population 
 now 
 in addition to that if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product for example what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population  
 also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends among the friends the first evidence you saw of a blip
  above zero in adoption of the innovation for example would be evidence of an impending epidemic 
 or you could see the first time the two curves diverged as shown on the left when did the randoms when did the friends take off and leave the randoms and [ when did ]
 their curve start shifting and that as indicated by the white line  occurred
  before the peak of the epidemic so this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month and a half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population 
 i should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors it could depend on the nature of the pathogen different pathogens  using 
  this technique you 'd get different warning or other phenomena that are spreading  or frankly on the structure of the human network  
  could also actually map the network of the students so this is a map of seven hundred and fourteen students and their friendship ties  and in a minute now i 'm going to put this map into motion we 're going to take daily cuts through the network for one hundred and twenty days 
 the red dots are going to be cases of the flu  and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu  and the size of the dots is going to be proportional to 
 how many of their friends have the flu  so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu
 and if you look at this image here we are now in september the 13th you 're going to see a few cases light up you 're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle here we are on october the 19th the slope 
  of the epidemic curve is approaching now in november bang bang bang bang bang you 're going to see lots of blooming in the middle and then you 're going to see a sort of leveling off fewer and fewer cases towards the end of december  
  individuals first before they affect others 
 now as i 've been suggesting this method is not restricted to germs but actually to anything that spreads in populations 
 information spreads in populations  norms can spread in populations behaviors can spread in populations  and by behaviors i can mean things like criminal behavior  or voting
  or health care behavior like smoking or vaccination  or product adoption or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence  if i 'm likely to do something that affects others around 
  me this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population  
  the same insights can also be exploited with respect to networks can also be exploited in other ways  for example in the use of targeting specific people for interventions  
 so for example most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity  
 so if we have a population of a thousand people and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen we don 't have to immunize
  every single person  if we immunize nine hundred and sixty of them it 's as as if we had immunized a hundred [ percent ] of them  because even if one or two of the non immune people gets infected there 's no one for them to 
  infect they are surrounded by immunized people so ninety six percent is as good as one hundred percent well
  and the answer is no  
 but if you took this thirty percent these three hundred people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated the friends of
  the three hundred the three hundred friends you can get the same level of herd immunity as if you had vaccinated ninety six percent of the population at a much greater efficiency with a strict budget constraint 
 in villages we could target to whom to give the interventions to foster these kinds of spreads or frankly for advertising with all kinds of products if we could understand how to target it could affect the efficiency of what we 're trying to achieve  
 and in fact we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays [ to do this ] this is a map of eight million phone users in a european country every dot is a person and every line represents a volume of
  calls between the people and we can use such data that 's being passively obtained to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network without actually 
  having to query them at all we can get this kind of a structural insight and other sources of information as you 're no doubt aware are available about such features from email interactions online
  online social networks and so forth  and in fact we are in the era of what i would call 
  data collection efforts they 're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data
 to create sensor networks to follow the population  understand what 's happening in the population  and intervene in the population for the better  
 because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom but where everyone is and what they 're thinking based on what they 're uploading
  on the internet  and what they 're buying based on their purchases  and all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before  
 so for example we could use truckers ' purchases of fuel  so the truckers are just going about their business and they 're buying fuel  and we see a blip up in the truckers
  purchases of fuel  and we know that a recession is about to end  
 or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway and the phone company can see as the velocity
 is slowing down that there 's a traffic jam  and they can feed that information back to their subscribers but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam  
 or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors passively and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within [ networks of ] doctors or again we can monitor
  purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations  
 and there are three ways i think that these massive passive data can be used one is fully passive like i just  described as in for instance the trucker example where we don 't actually intervene in the population in any way one is
  like the flu example i gave where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends do they have the flu or not and then get warning or another example 
  would be if you 're a phone company you figure out who 's central in the in the network and you ask those people look will you just text us your fever every day just text us your temperature and collect vast 
  amounts of information about people 's temperature  but from centrally located individuals and be able on a large scale to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people
  can be more fully active as i know subsequent speakers will also talk about today where people might globally participate in wikis  or photographing or monitoring elections and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena 
 in fact the availability of these data i think heralds a kind of new era of what i and i and others would like to call computational social science 
 it 's sort of like when galileo
  invented or didn 't invent came to use a telescope and could see the heavens in a new way  or leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope or actually invented and could see biology in a new 
  way  but now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible 
  comes to be greater than the sum of its parts  and actually we can use these insights to improve society and improve human
