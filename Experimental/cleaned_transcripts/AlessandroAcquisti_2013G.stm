  like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving adam and eve and
 the remarkable shift in the boundaries between
 public and private which has occurred in the past ten years you know the incident  adam and eve
 one day in the garden of eden realize they are naked they freak out  and the rest is history  
 nowadays adam and eve would probably act differently
  about us is being collected by organizations now
 there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information or big data  
 but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy  
 and my story is about these tradeoffs
  we start with an observation which in my mind has become clearer and clearer in the past few years that any personal information can become sensitive information  
 back in the year two thousand about one hundred billion photos were shot worldwide but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online in two thousand and ten only on facebook in a single
  two point five billion photos were uploaded most of them identified  
 in the same span of time computers ' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude 
 what happens when you combine these technologies together  increasing availability of facial data  improving facial recognizing ability by computers
  but also
 cloud computing which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three letter agencies  and ubiquitous computing 
  which allows my phone which is not a supercomputer to connect to the internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds well
 to test that we did an experiment on carnegie mellon university campus we asked students who were walking by to participate in a study  and we took a shot with a webcam  
 and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop while they were filling out the survey we uploaded their shot to a cloud computing cluster  and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images
 which we had downloaded from facebook profiles 
 by the time the subject reached the last page on the survey the page had been dynamically updated with the ten best matching photos which the recognizer had found 
 and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo do
 you see the subject
 the computer did and in fact did so for one out of three subjects 
 so essentially  we can start from an anonymous face  offline or online  and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data  
 but a few years back we did something else we started from social media data  we
  we ended up predicting social security numbers which in the united states are extremely sensitive information  do you see where i 'm going with this 
 so if you combine the two studies together then the question becomes can you start from a face
 and using facial recognition find a name and publicly available
  but in fact we even decided to develop an iphone app which uses the phone 's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what i just described to you in real time looking for a match finding public information
  to infer sensitive information  and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject
 an example of augmented reality probably a creepy example of augmented reality in fact  
 we didn 't develop the app to make it available just as a proof of concept
 in fact  take these technologies and push
  to their logical extreme imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their google glasses or one day their contact lenses
  and use seven or eight data points about you
 to infer anything else which may be known about you 
 what will this future without secrets look like and should we care 
  we may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases  
 but in fact having so much information doesn 't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective in another experiment  we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate 
 we included in this information some references to some funny  absolutely legal but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online
  now interestingly among our subjects some had posted comparable information  and some had not 
 which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly
 our subject paradoxically it was the group who had posted similar information  an example of moral
  you may be thinking this does not apply to me because i have nothing to hide but in fact privacy is not about having something negative
 to hide
 imagine that you are the h r director of a certain organization and you receive rsums
 and you decide to find more information about the candidates  therefore you google their names
 and in a certain universe you
  or in a parallel universe you find
 this information  do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview 
 if you think so then you are not like the u s employers who are in fact  part of our experiment  meaning we did exactly that we created facebook profiles manipulating traits then we started sending out rsums
  and we detected  we monitored whether they were searching for our candidates  and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media and they were discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates  
 now marketers like us
 to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor
  but think again why should that be always the case in a movie which came out a few
 years ago minority report a famous scene had tom cruise walk in a mall and
 holographic personalized advertising would appear around him now that movie is set in 
  about forty years from now and as exciting as that technology looks it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about
  you and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect 
 so as an example this is another experiment actually we are running not yet completed  
 imagine that an organization has access to your list of facebook friends  and through some kind of algorithm they can detect
 the two friends that you like the most and then they create in real time a facial composite of these two friends now
 prior to ours have shown that people don 't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites  
 but they react to those composites in a positive manner  so next time you are looking for a certain product and there is an ad
 suggesting you to buy it it will not be just a standard spokesperson  it will be one of your
  and you will not even know that this is happening 
 now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have
 to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight 
 one of these mechanisms is transparency  telling people what you are going to do with their data and in principle that 's a very good thing it 's necessary
  but it is not sufficient  transparency
 can be misdirected you can tell people what you are going to do and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information  so in yet another experiment this one with students 
 we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior including pretty sensitive questions such as this one
  another group of subjects we told them students and faculty will see your answers transparency
 notification and sure enough this worked in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second it makes sense right 
 but then we added the misdirection we repeated the experiment with the same two groups this time adding a delay
 between the time we told subjects how we would use their data
  the time we actually started answering the questions  
 how long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect
 of knowing that faculty would see your answers  ten minutes 
 five minutes one minute how about fifteen seconds fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups
  disclose the same amount of information  as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers  now i have to admit that this
 talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy  
 but that is not my point in fact i want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives the way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done  and certainly not the best way they can
 be done when someone tells you 
 people don 't care about privacy consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy 
 and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself  
 when someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data  consider that in the last
  twenty years  researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy preserving manner  
 we can browse the internet anonymously  we can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient not even the nsa we can have even
  big data while protecting privacy of course 
 these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects which is why perhaps you don 't hear more about them 
 which brings me back
 to the garden of eden there is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the garden of eden which
 feeling naked and feeling ashamed 
 you can find echoes of this interpretation in john milton 's paradise lost 
 in the garden  adam and eve are materially content they 're happy they are satisfied  however they also lack knowledge
 the moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge
  they discover themselves 
 they become aware they achieve autonomy 
 the price to pay however is leaving the garden  so privacy  in a way is both the means and the price to pay
 for freedom again  marketers tell us that big data and social media
 are not just a paradise of profit for them
  but a garden of eden for the rest of us we get free content we get to play angry birds  we get targeted apps  but in fact in a few years organizations will know so much 
  about us they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them  and perhaps
  there was one english author
 who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom
 for comfort 
 even more so than george orwell the author is of course  aldous huxley 
 in brave new world he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing
  in the book he also offers us a way out
 of that society  similar to the path that adam and eve had to follow to leave the garden  
 in the words of the savage
 regaining autonomy and freedom is possible although the price to pay is steep so
 i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the
  control over personal information 
 the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom rather than a force which will  hiddenly manipulate us  
 right now many of us do not even know that the fight is going on but it is whether you like it or not 
 and at the risk of playing the serpent i will tell you that the tools for the fight
 are here the awareness of what is going on and in your hands just a few clicks away  thank you
