  a part of a crew of astronauts
 traveling to mars or some distant planet the travel time could take a year or even longer 
 the space on board and the resources would
  be limited  so you and the crew would have to figure out
 how to produce food with minimal inputs 
 what if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds  
 and grow crops in a matter of hours  and what if those crops would then make more seeds
  enabling you to feed the entire crew
 with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip 
 well  the scientists at nasa actually figured out a way to do this 
 what they came up with was actually quite interesting it involved microorganisms which are  single celled organisms  
 and they also used hydrogen from water 
 the types of microbes that they
  a virtuous
 carbon cycle that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft 
 astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes
 and converted into a nutritious carbon rich crop the astronauts would then eat
  and exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide which would then be captured by the microbes to create a nutritious crop  which then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide by the astronauts 
 so in this way a closed loop carbon cycle is created  
 so why is this important 
 we need carbon to survive as humans  and we get our carbon from food 
 on a long space journey you simply wouldn 't be able to pick up any carbon along the way
  so you 'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board 
 this is a clever solution  right  
 but the thing is that research didn 't really go anywhere we haven 't yet gone to mars we haven 't yet gone to another planet
  and this was actually done in the ' 60s and ' 70s 
 so a colleague of mine dr john reed and
  were interested actually in carbon recycling here on earth  we wanted to come up with technical solutions to address climate change  and we discovered this research
 by reading some papers published in the 
 and later
 articles about this work  and we thought it was a really good idea  so we said well earth is actually like a spaceship  
 we have limited space
 and limited resources and on earth we really do need to figure out
  how to recycle our carbon better  so we had the idea can we take some of these nasa type ideas
 and apply them to our carbon problem here on earth
  could we cultivate these nasa type microbes in order to make valuable products here on earth
  we started a company to do it and in that company we discovered that these 
 which i 'll actually call nature 's supercharged carbon recyclers we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked
 and understudied  and that they could make some really valuable products so we began cultivating these products
  these microbes in our lab we found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide
 using these microbes 
 and we even made a protein rich meal that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal proteins 
 we began cultivating them even further  and we found that we can make oil
 oils are used to manufacture many products  we made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil  which can be used for flavoring and for
  fragrances  but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner or even as a jet fuel  
 and we made an oil that 's similar to palm oil
 palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods 
 we began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology and we 're currently working with them to bring some of these products to market
  we believe this type of technology can indeed help us profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products
 something that 's beneficial for the planet but also beneficial for business 
 that 's what we 're doing today but tomorrow  this type of technology and using these types of microbes
 actually could help us do something
  even greater
 if we take it to the next level 
 we believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that 's sustainable 
 that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow  
 and why might we need a sustainable agriculture  
 well actually it is estimated that the population will reach about ten billion by two
  're projecting that we will need to increase food production by seventy percent 
 in addition we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial goods  so how will we scale to meet that demand well
 modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand 
  are a number of reasons why one of them
 is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases 
 in fact it emits more greenhouse gases than our cars our trucks our planes and our trains combined  
 another reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land  
 we have cleared nineteen point four million square miles for crops and
  livestock what does that look like well that 's roughly the size of south america
 and africa combined
 let me give you a specific example in indonesia 
 an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately
 ireland  between two thousand and two thousand and twelve just think of all of the species
  diversity that was removed in the process  whether plant life insects or animal life and a natural carbon sink was also removed
 so let me make this real for you 
 this clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations  
 and as i mentioned before palm oil is used to manufacture many products in fact it is estimated that over fifty percent of consumer products
 are manufactured using palm oil  
 and that includes things like ice cream  cookies 
 it includes cooking oils it also includes detergents  lotions soaps 
 you and i both probably have numerous items
 in our kitchens and our bathrooms that were manufactured using palm oil  so you and i are direct
 beneficiaries
 of removed rainforests modern ag has some problems  and we need solutions if we want to scale
 sustainably
 i believe that microbes can be a part of the answer specifically these supercharged carbon recyclers
  these supercharged carbon recyclers like plants serve as the natural recyclers in their ecosystems where they thrive  and they thrive in exotic places on earth like hydrothermal vents and hot springs
 in those ecosystems they take carbon and recycle it into the nutrients needed for those ecosystems  
 and they 're rich in nutrients such as oils and proteins  minerals
 and carbohydrates and actually
  microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives
 if you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a friday night after a long hard work week 
 then you are enjoying a product of microbes  
 if you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery a product of microbes  or bread  or
  or yogurt these are all products of microbes  
 but the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours 
 versus months that means we can make crops much faster
 they can grow in containers that require minimal space 
 and we can get to a type of vertical agriculture  instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture that requires so much land we can scale vertically  
 and as a result produce much more product
 per area if we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers
 then we wouldn 't have to remove any more rainforests to make the food and the goods that we consume  
 because at a large scale you can actually make
 ten thousand times more output per land area
 than you could for instance if you used soybeans if you planted soybeans on that same area of land over a period of a year ten thousand
  times over a period of a year  
 so this is what i mean by a new type of agriculture 
 and this is what i mean by developing a system that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of ten billion 
 and what would be the products of this new type
  we 've already made a protein meal  so you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal  or even cornmeal or wheat flour  
 we 've already made oils  so you can imagine something similar to
 coconut oil or olive oil or soybean oil  
 so this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients that would give us pasta and bread  cakes nutritional items of many sorts
 is used to manufacture
 multiple other goods industrial products and consumer products you can imagine being able to make detergents soaps lotions  etc using these types of crops
 not only are we running out of space 
 but if we continue to operate under the status quo with modern agriculture  we run the risk of robbing our progeny
  of a beautiful planet but it doesn 't have to be this way  we can imagine a future of abundance 
 let us create systems that
 keep
 planet earth our spaceship  not only from not crashing 
 but let us also develop systems and ways of living that will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves
 and the ten billion that will be on this planet by two thousand and fifty  thank you very much
