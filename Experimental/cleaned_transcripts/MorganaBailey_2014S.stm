  when i was young  i prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative u s state i live in kansas 
 i didn 't follow along with the crowd  i wasn 't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles i was outspoken
  extremely social even these pictures and postcards of my london semester abroad
 sixteen years ago show that i obviously didn 't care if i was perceived as weird
 or different but that same year i was in london sixteen
  i realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique and that changed
 everything  
 i became the opposite of who i thought i once was i stayed in my room instead of socializing 
 i stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities  
 i didn 't want to stand out in the crowd anymore
  i told myself it was because i was growing up and maturing 
 not that i was suddenly looking for acceptance  i had always assumed i was immune to needing acceptance  after all i was a bit unconventional 
 but i realize now
 that the moment i realized something was different about me
 was the exact same moment that i began conforming and
  hiding is a progressive habit and once you start hiding  it becomes harder and harder
 to step forward and speak out 
 in fact even now when i was talking to people about what this talk was about i made up a cover story
 and i even hid the truth about my ted talk so it is fitting
 and scary
 that i have
  returned to this city sixteen years later and i have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding  
 what have i been hiding for sixteen years 
 i am a lesbian
  i 've struggled to say those words because i didn 't want to be defined by them 
 every time i would think about coming out in the past i would think to myself  
 but i just want to be known as
 morgana uniquely morgana but not my lesbian friend morgana or my gay coworker morgana 
 just morgana 
 for those of you from large metropolitan areas 
 this may not seem like a big deal to you  it may seem strange that i have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long
 by my fear of not being accepted 
 and i 'm not alone of course 
 a two thousand and thirteen deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity 
 of all the employees they surveyed sixty one percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work
  of all the gay lesbian and bisexual employees eighty three percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves
 so they would not appear at work too gay the study found
 that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion
  employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe conformity is critical to their  long term career advancement 
 and while i was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves 
 i was scared
 when i discovered that my silence has
  the length by which life expectancy is shortened for gay lesbian and bisexual people
 in highly anti gay communities compared to accepting communities  twelve years reduced life expectancy
  when i read that in the advocate magazine this year i realized i could no longer afford to keep silent  
 the effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination 
 the study found that gays in anti gay communities had higher rates of heart disease  
 violence and suicide  
 what i once thought was simply a personal matter
 i realized
  had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine my choice to hide
 and not share who i really am
 may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination  
 i 'd always told myself there 's no reason to share that i was gay  but the idea that my
  silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when i missed an opportunity
 to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of kansas 
 in february the kansas house of representatives brought up a bill for vote
 that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to
  deny gays services 
 a former coworker and friend of mine
 has a father who serves in the kansas house of representatives  he voted
 in favor
 of the bill in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me
 how does my friend feel about lesbian gay  bisexual transgender queer and questioning people 
 how does her father feel 
 i don 't know  because i was never honest with them about who i am and that shakes me to the core
  what if i had told her my story years ago  
 could she have told her father my experience  could i have ultimately helped change his vote  
 i will never know and that made me realize
 i had done nothing to try to make a difference  
 how ironic that i work in human
  a profession that works to welcome  connect and encourage the development of employees 
 a profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace 
 and yet i have done nothing to advocate for diversity 
 when i came to this company one year ago i thought to myself this company has
  policies that protect gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people 
 their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs  
 when i walk through the doors of this company  i will finally come out  
 but i didn 't instead of taking advantage of the opportunity  i did nothing
  my london semester
  abroad sixteen years ago
  i came to
