  when we think about mapping cities we tend to think about roads and streets and buildings  
 and the settlement narrative that led to their creation or you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer  
 but there 's other ways to think about mapping cities and how they got to be made  today i want to show you a new kind of map this is
  not a geographic map this is a map of the relationships between people in my hometown of baltimore maryland  
 and what you can see here is that each dot represents a person each line represents a relationship between those people and each color represents a community within the network  
 now i 'm here on the green side down on the far right
  side of the network you tend to have primarily  african american and latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are 
 but just to give some sense the green part of the network we call smalltimore for those of us that inhabit it because it seems as though we 're living in a very small town we see the same people over and over again 
 but that 's because we 're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city
  on the other end of the network you have folks who are interested in things like hip hop music and they even identify with living in the dc maryland virginia area over say the baltimore
 city designation proper  
 but in the middle you see that there 's something that connects the two communities together and that 's sports we have the baltimore orioles the baltimore ravens football team michael phelps the olympian under armour you may have heard of
  baltimore company and that community of sports acts as the only bridge between these two ends of the network  
 let 's take a look at san francisco you see something a little bit different happening in san francisco
  on the one hand you do have the media politics and news
 lobe that tends to exist in baltimore and other cities  but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are
 sort of taking over the top half of the network  and there 's even a group
  that 's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as twitter employees next to the geeks  in between the gamers and the geeks at the opposite end of the hip hop spectrum
  so you can see though that
 the tensions that we 've heard about in san francisco in terms of people being concerned about gentrification and
 all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth and settlement into the city are real and you can actually see that documented here
  you can see the lgbt community is not really getting along with the geek community that well
 the arts community the music community  and so it leads to things like this [ evict twitter ]
 somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago  and it shows what is happening on the ground in san francisco and i think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this let
 's take a look at rio de
  i spent the last few weeks gathering data about rio and one of the things that stood out to me about this city
 is that everything 's really kind of mixed up it 's a very heterogenous city in a way that baltimore or san francisco is not you still have the lobe of people involved with government 
 newspapers politics columnists tedxrio is down in the lower right right next to bloggers and writers but then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music even justin bieber fans are represented here
 gospel music funk and rap and stand up comedy and there 's even a whole section around drugs and jokes how cool is that 
 and then the flamengo football team is also represented here so you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music but it 's represented in a very different way and i think that
 maybe fits with our understanding of rio as being a very multicultural  musically diverse city
 so
 we have all this data it 's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now maybe even richer than any data set that we 've ever had before
  so what can we do with it  well i think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct it 's something that we choose to do and we could choose not
  you kind of think about it what we 're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city and looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria  and seeing  how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart 
 well maybe it 's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit 
 the other thing that we start to realize
 is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity we 've got people represented from all different types of races across the
  only looking at race doesn 't really contribute to our development of diversity so if we 're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems we need to start to think about diversity in a new way  
 and lastly we have the ability to create
 interventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way  and i believe that if we have that capability we may even bear some responsibility to do so 
 so what is a city  i think some might say that it
  a
 geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings  but i believe that a city is the sum of the relationships of the people that live there  
 and i believe that
 if we can start to document those relationships in a real way then maybe we have a real shot at creating those kinds of cities that we 'd like to have thank you
