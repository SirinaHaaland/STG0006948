  so i work in marketing which i love but my first passion was physics a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher  when i had a
 little less gray hair  so
 he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around
  us and i 'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing  so quick show of hands who studied some marketing in university  
 who studied some physics in university  pretty good and at school okay  lots of you so hopefully this will bring back some happy or possibly some slightly disturbing memories
  something very simple newton 's law the force equals mass times acceleration this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully
 before they ran this campaign 
 but if we rearrange this formula quickly  we can get to acceleration equals force over mass 
 which means that for a larger particle
 a larger mass it requires more force to change its direction  
 it 's the same with brands  
 the more massive a brand the more baggage it has  the more force is needed to change its positioning  
 and that 's one of the reasons why arthur andersen chose to launch accenture rather than try to persuade the world that andersen 's could stand for something other than accountancy  
 it explains why
 hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners  
 and why companies like unilever and p & g keep brands separate like ariel and pringles and dove
 rather than having one giant parent brand  
 so the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction  the marketing is the bigger a
  brand  the more difficult it is to reposition it so think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures 
 now who remembers heisenberg 's uncertainty principle 
 getting a little more technical now so this says that it 's impossible by definition to measure exactly the state i e the position and the momentum of a particle because the act of measuring it  by definition changes it  
 so to explain that
 if you 've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it  then the photon of light has momentum which
 knocks the particle  so you don 't know where it was before you looked at it  
 by measuring it  the act of measurement changes it  
 the act of observation changes it  it 's the same in marketing  so with the act of observing consumers changes their behavior  
 think about the group
  of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group  and almost none of them buy lots of junk food  and yet mcdonald 's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year 
 think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets who stuff their trolleys full of fresh
 green vegetables and fruit  but don 't shop like that any other day  and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly
 look for porn on the web  it 's very few yet at google we know it 's the number one searched for category  so
 luckily  the science no sorry the marketing is getting easier  luckily with now better point of sale tracking more digital
 media consumption you can measure more what consumers actually do 
  rather than what they say they do  
 so the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle because the observation changes it  
 the marketing is the message for marketing is that
 try to measure what consumers actually do  rather than what they say they 'll do or anticipate they 'll do  
 so next the scientific method
 an axiom of physics of all science says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation you can only disprove it
 what this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning  and it will strengthen it  but it will not conclusively prove it and only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water  
 so if we take an example
 ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the earth it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that
  idea out of the water  and there are parallels for marketing
 you can invest for a long time in a brand  but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers ' belief take bp
 they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand  but then
 one little accident  think about toyota it was for a
  long time revered as the most reliable of cars  and then they had the big recall incident  
 and tiger woods for a long time  the perfect brand ambassador  well you know the story  
 so the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis  but it 's easy to disprove it any hypothesis
  is shaky and the marketing is that not matter how much you 've invested in your brand one bad week can undermine decades of good work so be really careful to try and avoid the screw ups that can undermine your brand  
 and lastly to the slightly obscure world of entropy the second law of thermodynamics 
 this says that entropy which is a measure of the disorder of a system will always increase
  the same is true of marketing if we go back twenty years the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand  
 but where we are today  things have changed you can get a strong brand image
 or a message and put it out there like the conservative party did earlier this year with their
  but then you lose control of it  with the kind of digital
 comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer  it 's impossible to control where it goes 
 your brand starts being dispersed 
 it gets more chaotic 
 it 's out of your control
  he did a good job  
 but while this may be unsettling for marketers  it 's actually a good thing this distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people more in with the people  
 it makes this distribution of energy a
 democratizing force which is ultimately good for your brand  so the lesson from physics is that entropy will
  always increase it 's a fundamental law the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed you can 't fight it  so embrace it and find a way to work with it  
 so to close  my teacher mr vutter told me that physics is cool 
 and hopefully i 've convinced you that physics can teach all of us  even in the world of marketing something special  thank you
