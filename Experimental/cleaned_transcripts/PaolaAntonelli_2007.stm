  those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be and in my idea heaven is satisfied curiosity  
 i think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where i can just lie down with my belly down
  like i was watching tv when i was a child and my elbows up and i can basically look everywhere i want see every movie i 've always wanted to see and in the same kind 
  of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you 're reading there 's something really soothing and easy 
  years of age that i was much more comfortable with objects than with people i finally decided to really embrace this passion  and i basically live my life in sort of a trance 
 and i look around and everything i see is just the beginning of a long story 
  building in midtown so we were in the small small small boondocks that was one of the funnest moments of my career  
 but it 's not only that the typeface the typeface is helvetica it 's 's its   50th anniversary this year and so i start thinking max miedinger and all those swiss designers together trying to
 outdo
 and come up with a new sans serif typeface and the movie starts playing in my head already and of course you can imagine with humble masterpieces it was the
  same thing
 multiplied by a hundred and i do hope by the way that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you the exhibition was meant to be a way
 to
 have children think of doing  you know when they do homeworks at home instead of having a tray with two peas i was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother 's handbag and do their
  tray so everybody 's always suggesting new humble masterpieces and at moma we put out some books
 just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces and when you do that usually you get
 eighty percent porn and twenty percent real suggestions and instead
 it was all almost all good suggestions and a lot of nationalism came in for instance  i didn 't know that the spaniards invented the mop
  but they were very proud so every spaniard said la frego and italians did the pizza  and i wanted to show you also the suggestions from kentucky are pretty good they had moonshine laundry detergents and liquid nails  
 and i keep it going and i just got also  this suggestion from milan it 's our
 traffic divider  which we call panettone 
  and it 's painted it 's these beautiful concrete things that you use around milan to define all the lanes of traffic so 
 think of your own send them on if you want to they 're always welcome
  but an exhibition like that made me understand even more what i 've been thinking of for thirteen years ever since i got to moma 
 i 'm italian  in italy 
 design is normal different parts of the world have a knack for different things  i was just recently in
  argentina and in uruguay 
 and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don 't see elsewhere but the contemporary art was terrible  
 in italy  in milan especially contemporary art really doesn 't have that much of a place but design oh my god what you find at the store at the
  without going to any kind of fancy store is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated it 's just what you find at the store 
 and new york has another kind of knack for contemporary art i 'm always amazed  three year olds know who
 richard serra is and take you to the galleries  but design for some reason is still misunderstood
  it 's really interesting what many people think when i say the word design is they think of this kind of overdesigned
 in this case it 's overdesigned on purpose but decoration interior decoration they think of somebody choosing fabrics design can be that of course but it can also 
  be this it can be a school of design in jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people because as you know israel deploys one gas mask per person
  including babies so what these designers do is they find a way to
 lower the neckline so that instead of being completely strangled a teenager can also sip a coke they tried to make a toddler 's
 gas mask
 in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important and then they make a little tent for the baby
 however cruel however
 ruthless you can think this is it 's a great design and it is miles away from the fancy furniture but still it 's part of my same field of passion what i 've been doing at moma
 since the beginning
 is to try to harness the power of moma because it 's great to work there you really have power in that people usually tend to know about
  your exhibition or see the exhibitions 
 and that is power because in a design museum i wouldn 't have as many visitors i 'm very well aware that eighty percent of my public is there to see picasso and matisse  and then they stumble upon my show and i keep them there  
 but what i 've been trying to do is something that the curators at moma in my department have been doing
  ever since the museum was founded in one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine which is to try and see what 's going on in the world
 and try to use that authority in order to make things better 
 there have been many episodes and actually eames demetrius may be here in the audience but in two instances
 grandfather i 'm always a little a little perplexed about the relation exactly
  charles eames the first time and then charles and ray eames the second time were involved in two competitions one in one thousand nine hundred and forty it was about organic furniture and the second one in one thousand nine hundred and 
 forty eight was low cost furniture for the gis coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture  and then there was good design
  for a better life 
 so i started out in ' ninety five with this exhibition that was called mutant materials in contemporary design it was about a new phase in my opinion in the world 
  of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves  
  in california at that time they were beginning to be
 brought into the civilian market and at the same time the gorgeous work of takeshi ishiguro who did these beautiful salt and pepper containers that are made of rice dough 
 so you see  the range is really quite diverse  and then for instance this other
  exhibition that was entitled workspheres in two thousand and one where i asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type 
 of work styles that were happening in the world at that time and you see ideo there it
  a sky in a room it 's a very famous italian song 
 and other examples this was marti guixe about working on the go  and hella jongerius my favorite about how to work at home  
 and this lets me introduce a very important idea about design designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs 
 current conditions in economy in
  sustainability issues and then
 what they do at the end if they are good is much more than the sum of its parts hella jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing 
 and also quite hilarious the idea behind her work was that at that time
  that 's particularly gorgeous it 's the tv dinner of two thousand and one 
 there have been many other exhibitions in the meantime but i don 't want to focus on my shows i would like instead to talk about
 how great some designers are i 've always had a hard time with the word maverick i came to the united states thirteen years ago and to this day i have to ask what does that mean so this morning i went to see on the dictionary
 and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle therefore he was not following everybody 's lead
  and therefore he was a maverick so designers do need to be mavericks because the best way to design a successful object and also an object that
 we were missing before is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will
 be able to have a new behavior with it so safe is the last exhibition that i did at moma and it ended at the beginning of last year
 it was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection it 's a long story because it started before two thousand and one and it was called emergency and then when nine eleven happened i had
 a shock and i canceled the exhibition until slowly but surely it came back
 as a half full glass instead of
  cameron and i worked a little bit together and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition but what is interesting is that
 we don 't need to talk about design and art anymore design uses
  whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point it 's a sense of economy and a sense also of humor  this is a beautiful
 project by ralph borland who 's south african  it 's
 a suit for civil disobedience the idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you you 're wearing this thing it 's like a big heart and
  and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified and the police is reminded it 's like having a flower in front of the of the rifle and also you can imagine 
  a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police
  tony dunne and fiona raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our
 paranoia like this hideaway furniture that 's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away or even better  the huggable atomic mushroom 
 which got me an article on the bulletin of atomic scientists of the united states i don 't think it ever happened before at moma or this faraday chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations  but the interesting thing in the exhibition is
 the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self  and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic this is cindy van den bremen who is a dutch designer that 's done this series of capsters 
 they are athletic athletic gear for muslim women that enable them to ski  play tennis do whatever they want to do without having to
 uncap themselves
 and sometimes by doing this kind of research you encounter such beautiful ideas of design  twan verdonck is really
 young i think he 's twenty seven 
 and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments they 're quite beautiful 
 they range from
  this fluffy toy that is about hugging you because autistic children like to be hugged tight so it has a spring inside all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self
  design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges i was recently at a conference on luxury
  organized by the herald tribune in istanbul and it was really interesting because i was the last speaker
 and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury 
 and i didn 't want to be a party pooper but at the same time i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality 
 and the truth is that
 there are very different kinds of luxury  and there 's luxury that is relative for people that don 't have that much i want to
  make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy very very clear limits this is cuba  and this 
  is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell  and this is
 got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money but that 's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself
 so really design takes everything into account  and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances as
 we become more and more wireless and impalpable
  instead want us to be hands on sometimes 
  this is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint all the way 
 to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by ana mir in barcelona
  this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes 
 it 's quite beautiful because somehow  this is a gorgeous moment for design 
 many years ago i heard a mathematician from vienna whose name was marchetti
  explain how the
 innovation in the military industry therefore  secret innovation and the innovation in the
  civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed  and that makes sense in moments of war there 's great technological innovation and in the world you have to do without well  during the second world war you had to do without steel you had to do without aluminum  
 and then as peace comes all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian
  many of you might know that the potato chip chair by charles and ray eames comes exactly from that kind of instance fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden 
 i think that this is a strange moment the rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously just like the rhythm of our life in the past twenty five years so i 'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is but it surely is a very important moment for
  the technology proceeding not only is computing technology making  open source possible also in the world of design  but also
 the idea of sustainability which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of co2 emissions and footprint but also sustainability of human interrelationships 
 is very much part of the work of so many designers and that 's why designers more and more are working on behaviors rather than on objects especially the
 ones not all of them 
 i wanted to show you for instance the work of mathieu lehanneur which is quite fantastic he 's another young designer from france who 's working and at this point he 's working also with pharmaceutical companies
  on new ways to engage patients especially children in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty
  this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it 's time for you to take the medicine so the child has to go pffff 
 to release and relieve the container itself and this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind
 of delivery similarly there 's the work of people like marti guixe
  that tries to involve you in a way that is
 really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from
 your mistakes or from your taste orally  
 the next show that i 'm going to work on and i 've been bugging a lot of you about this here is about the relationship between design and science  i 'm trying to find not the metaphors but rather the points in common the common gripes 
 the common
 issues the common preoccupations
 and i think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as
 an instruction as a direction rather than a prescription of form
