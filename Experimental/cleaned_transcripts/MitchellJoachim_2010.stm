  why grow homes  
 because we can right now america is in an unremitting state of trauma  and there 's a cause for that all right 
 we 've got mcpeople  mccars  mchouses as an architect
  i have to confront something like this so what 's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses  
 well it 's been around for two thousand five hundred years it 's called pleaching or grafting trees together or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous vascular system  
 and we do something different than what we did in the past we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that we use cnc to make scaffolding to train semi epithetic matter plants
  into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a fab tree hab it fits into the environment it is the environment  it is the landscape right and you can have a hundred million 
 of these homes and it 's great because they suck carbon  they 're perfect you can have one hundred million families  or
  house we also do
 the in vitro meat habitat or homes that we 're doing research on now
 in brooklyn where as an architecture office we 're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering 
 and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one so we 've been doing this for a couple of years and that 's our lab and what we do is
  we grow extracellular matrix from pigs we use a modified inkjet printer  and we print geometry we print geometry where we can make industrial design objects
 like you know 
 shoes leather belts handbags etc where no sentient creature is harmed it 's victimless it 's meat from a test tube so our theory is that eventually
  we should be doing this with homes so here is a typical stud wall an architectural construction and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house where you can see we use 
 fatty cells as insulation cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows 
  had a big show in prague  and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat that 's why we grow homes  thanks very much
