  after two days here i declare myself boggled and enormously impressed
 you are one of the great hopes not just for american achievement
 in science and technology but for the whole world
  i 've come  however on a special mission on behalf of
  a million trillion insects and other small creatures
  and to
 make a plea for them  if we were to wipe out insects alone just that group alone
  this planet
 which we are trying hard to do the rest of life and humanity with it
 would mostly disappear
 from the land and within a few months now how did i come
 to this particular position of advocacy as a little boy
  my teenage years  i became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life 
 i had a butterfly period  
 a snake period a bird period  a fish period a cave period and finally
 and definitively an
  by my college years  i was
 a devoted myrmecologist a specialist on the biology of ants  but my attention and research continued to make
 journeys across
 the great variety of life on earth in general
 including all that it means to
 us as a species  how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities
  have created for it out of that broader study
 has emerged a concern and an ambition  crystallized in the wish that i 'm about to make to you 
 my choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment
 that began with growing up on the gulf coast of alabama on the florida peninsula
  as far back as i can remember i was enchanted by the natural beauty
 of that region
 and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there 
 one day when i was only seven years old and fishing  i pulled a pinfish they 're called
  too hard and fast and i blinded myself in one eye  
 i later discovered i was also hard of hearing  possibly congenitally in the upper registers so in planning
 to be a professional naturalist
 i never considered anything else in my entire life i found that i was lousy at bird watching
  i turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the
 thumb and forefinger  the little things
 that compose the foundation
 of our ecosystems  the little things as i like to say  who run the world in so doing
  reached a frontier of biology so strange so rich that it seemed as though it exists
 on another planet in fact we live on a mostly unexplored planet 
 the great majority of organisms on earth remain unknown to science in the
  thirty years thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology biologists have for
 example  added a full one third of
 the known frog and other amphibian species to bring the current total to five thousand four hundred 
 and more continue to pour in 
 two new kinds of whales have been discovered along with two new antelopes
  dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant and even a distinct kind of gorilla  at the extreme opposite end of the
 size scale  the class of marine bacteria
  the prochlorococci that will be on the
  are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on earth and moreover responsible
 for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean these bacteria were not
 uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest
  earth 's organisms so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy yet life in the sea
 may depend on these tiny creatures 
 these examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet  
 consider the fungi including mushrooms rusts molds and many 
  organisms 
  but more than one point five million have been estimated to exist  
 consider the nematode roundworm  the most abundant of all animals  four out of five
 animals on earth are nematode worms if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be
  you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it
 in nematode worms about sixteen thousand
 species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists there could be 
 even millions still unknown 
 this vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter
 of the biological world
  bacteria  which
 within just the last several years still were known from only about six thousand species of bacteria
 worldwide  but that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil
  ten billion bacteria that would be there it 's been estimated that a single ton
 of soil fertile soil contains approximately
 four million species of bacteria all
  the question is what are they all doing
  fact is we don 't know we are living on a planet
 with
 a lot of activities with reference to our living environment  done by faith and guess alone
  our lives depend upon these creatures to take an example close to home
  five hundred species of bacteria now known friendly bacteria living symbiotically in your mouth and throat
 probably necessary to your health for holding off
 pathogenic bacteria at this point i think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for
  assisted in this by billie holiday
  the gene weavers that
 promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria are a virtually unknown frontier
 of modern biology a world unto themselves
  constitutes a viral species is still unresolved although they 're obviously of enormous importance to us  
 but this much we can say  the variety of genes on the planet
 in viruses exceeds  or is likely to exceed that in all of the rest of life combined
  in addressing microbial biodiversity scientists are like explorers in a rowboat
 launched
 onto the pacific ocean  but that is changing rapidly with the aid of new
 genomic technology  already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code
 of a bacterium in under four hours soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs to
  hunt bacteria in tiny crevices
 of the habitat 's surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars  what will we find as we map the living
 world 
 as finally we get this underway seriously  as we move past the relatively gigantic
  to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond
 to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world
 enveloped and living within humanity already what were thought to be bacteria
 for generations have been found to
  two great domains of microorganisms  true bacteria and one celled organisms
 the archaea which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota the group that we belong to 
 some serious biologists  and i count myself
 among them have begun to wonder that among the enormous
 and still unknown diversity of microorganisms one might
 just might
 find aliens among them  true aliens  stocks that arrived from outer space  they 've had
 billions of years to do it  but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet  
 we do know that some bacterial species that
 have earthly origin
 are capable
  of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh
 changes in environment including hard radiation
 strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the pyrex vessels around the growing
 population of bacteria there may be a temptation to treat the biosphere
  holistically and the species that compose it
 as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other but
 each of these species even the tiniest prochlorococci are masterpieces of evolution 
 each has persisted for thousands to millions of years each is exquisitely adapted
  to the environment in which it lives  interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which
 our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine 
 we will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence and unfortunately we are
 destroying them
 with ingenuity and ceaseless energy my own epiphany as a conservationist came 
 while a harvard graduate student searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of cuba ants that shine in the
  and one species i discovered metallic gold i found my magical ants  but only after a tough climb into the mountains
 where the last of the native cuban forests hung on and were then and
 still are being cut back i realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique marvelous animals
  and plants on that island and this is true of
 practically every part of the world
 which took millions of years to evolve are in the process of disappearing forever and so it is
 everywhere one looks the human juggernaut is permanently eroding earth 's ancient biosphere
 by a combination of forces that can be
  summarized by the acronym hippo 
 the animal hippo  h is for habitat destruction including climate change forced by greenhouse gases  i
 is for the invasive species like the fire ants the zebra mussels  broom grasses
 and pathogenic bacteria and viruses
 that are
  flooding every country and at
 an exponential rate that 's the i the p the first one in hippo is for pollution  
 the second
 is for continued population human population expansion and the final letter is 
  driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing  the hippo juggernaut
 we have created if unabated is destined according to the best estimates
 of ongoing biodiversity research
 to reduce half of earth 's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century
  a quarter of surviving species
 during the next five decades  what will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment
 is thus degraded  huge potential sources of scientific information
 yet to be gathered much of our environmental stability
 and new kinds of pharmaceuticals
  and new products of unimaginable strength and value all thrown away  the loss will inflict a heavy price
 in wealth  security
 and yes  spirituality for all time to come  because previous cataclysms of this kind the last one that ended the age of dinosaurs
 to ten million years to repair  
 sadly our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it
 before it is even discovered for example even in the united states  the two hundred thousand species known currently
  found to be only partial
 in coverage it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology 
 only about fifteen percent of the known species have been studied well enough
 to evaluate their status of the fifteen percent evaluated  twenty percent
  in danger of extinction that 's in the united states we are in short  flying blind
 into our environmental future 
 we urgently need to change this we need to have the biosphere properly explored
 so that we can understand and competently manage it we need to settle down before we wreck the
  and we need that knowledge this should be a big science project equivalent to the human genome project 
 it should be thought of as a biological moonshot
 with a timetable 
 so this brings me to my wish for tedsters  and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk  i wish we will work together
 to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of earth 's biodiversity and
  let us call it the encyclopedia of life what is the encyclopedia of life a concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be
 looked at seriously it is an encyclopedia that lives on the internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world 
 amateurs can do it also it has
 an indefinitely
  expandable page for each species it makes all key information about life on earth accessible
 to anyone on demand anywhere in the world  
 i 've written about this idea before and i know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it
  but what excites me is that since i first put forward
 this particular idea in that form science has advanced  technology has moved forward  
 today  the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it 
 are within reach indeed in the past
  a group of influential scientific institutions
 have begun mobilizing to realize this dream  i wish you would help them  working together we can make this real
 to spread and
