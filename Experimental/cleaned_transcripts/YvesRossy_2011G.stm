  many of the tests are conducted while yves is strapped onto the wing  because yves ' body is an integral part of the aircraft [ wind tunnel tests ] narrator 
 the wing has no steering controls no flaps no rudder  yves uses his body to steer the wing
  even with the leg  he 's 's acting as a as a human fuselage so to say and that 's quite unique narrator 
 when he arches his back 
 he gains altitude  
  when he pushes his shoulders forward  he goes into a dive
  on
  the wing is open so our first critical moment  it 's open he is down 
 is he flying  
 commentator two it looks like he 's stabilized he 's starting to make his climb commentator one there 's that ninety degree turn  he 's out over the channel there
 is yves rossy there is no turning back now he is over the english channel
 and under way ladies and gentlemen
  a historic flight has begun
  on those toggles to flare  slow himself down just a little bit  and then come in for for a nice
  those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities and there were many many others  so it 's possible to fly almost like
  i don 't have feathers but i feel like a bird sometimes it 's really
 an unreal feeling because normally you have a big thing a plane around you and
 when i strap just this little
  you start to become jetman yr it was
 about twenty years ago when i discovered free falling when you go out of an airplane  you are almost naked you take a position like that 
 and especially when you take a tracking position you have the feeling that you you are flying
  and that 's the
 nearest thing to the dream you have no machine around you you are just in the element  it 's very short and only in one direction 
 so the idea
 was okay  keep that feeling of freedom  but change the vector and increase the time
  hundred and ninety miles per hour bg what 's the weight of the equipment you 're carrying yr when i exit full of kerosene
 i 'm about  fifty five kilos i have  fifty five kilos on my back bg 
 and you 're not piloting there is no handle no steering nothing it is purely your body and the wings become part of
  i wanted to keep this freedom
 of movement and it 's really like the kid playing the airplane i want to go down
 like that  and up i climb i turn  it 's really pure flying  it 's not steering it 's
  try to stay just fit  i don 't do special physical training i just try to
 to keep my mobility through new activities 
 for example  last winter i began with kite surfing so new things so you have to adapt
 i 'm quite an experienced
 manager of systems as a pilot  but this is really you need fluidity you need to be
 agile and also to adapt really fast bg somebody in the audience asked me how does he breathe up there because you 're going fast and you 're up at three thousand
  up to three thousand meters it 's
 not
 such a big problem with oxygen but for example bikers they have the same speed 
 just with the helmet  integral helmet it 's really no problem to breathe bg 
 describe for me the equipment
  working with kerosene  harness 
 parachute my only instruments are an altimeter and time i know i have about eight minutes fuel so i just check
 before it 's finished
  if i have a problem with the first one i pull  
 i still have the possibility to open the second one and this is my life that 's the real important thing about safety 
 i did use that during these last fifteen years about twenty times 
 never with that type of wing but at the beginning
  of the gibraltar
 strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean  so that was one of those cases where you let the wings go right yr yeah  i 
  did try in the clouds  but you lose orientation completely so i did try
  you have not the right altitude  so the next thing i saw was just blue it was the sea  
 i have also an audible altimeter so i i was at my minimum altitude in that vector
 fast so i
 pulled that  and then i did open my chute bg so the wings have their own parachute and you have your two parachutes yr exactly there is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons so i can repair it afterward and especially
 risky stuff indeed people have died trying to do this kind of of thing and you don 't look like a crazy guy you 're a swiss airline pilot so you 're rather a checklist kind of guy  
 i assume you have
 standards yr yeah  i have no checklist for that
  know very well  we have a hundred years of
 experience  and you can
 adapt really
 precisely with that i have to adapt to something new that means
 improvise  
 so it 's really a play between these two approaches something that i know very well these principles for example  we have two engines on an airbus 
 with only one engine you can fly
  so plan b  always a plan b in a fighter you have an ejection seat  that 's my ejection seat  so i have the approach of a professional pilot
 with
 the respect of a pioneer in front of mother nature bg it 's well said
  a roll  and
 then i stabilize and according to my altitude  i continue on two or three engines it 's sometimes possible it
 's quite complicated to explain but according to which
 regime i was i can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land and then i open my parachute bg so the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off
  plane or a helicopter  and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines and then you basically take off  mid air somewhere  and then the landing as we have seen arriving on this
 side of the channel is through a parachute  so just as a curiosity where did you land when you flew over the grand canyon did
 you land on the rim
 down at the bottom yr it was down on the bottom  and i came back afterward
 on the sled of the helicopter back  but it was too stony and full of cactus on top bg that 's exactly why i asked the question yr
 and also the currents are are quite
 funny there there is big thermal activity big difference in altitude also  so it was it was much
  for me to land at the bottom
  what 's next for you what 's next for jetman yr first to
 instruct a younger guy  i want to share it to do formation flights and
 i plan to start from a cliff like catapulted from a cliff bg so instead of
 jumping off a plane yes yr yes with the final goal to take off  but with initial speed
  i go step by step it seems a little bit crazy  but it 's not it 's possible to start already now it 's just too dangerous 
 the increasing technology  better technology it will be safe  and i hope it will be for everybody
