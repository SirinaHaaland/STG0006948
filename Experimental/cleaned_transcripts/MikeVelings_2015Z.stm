  so i come from the tallest people on the planet the dutch  
 it hasn 't always been this way in fact all across the globe  people have been gaining height  in the last one hundred and fifty years  in developed countries
  on average we have gotten ten centimeters taller 
 and scientists have a lot of theories about why this is  but almost all of them involve nutrition namely the increase of dairy and meat 
 in the last fifty years  global meat consumption has more than quadrupled  from seventy one million tons to three hundred and ten million tons
 something similar has been going on with milk and eggs in every society where incomes have risen so has protein consumption  
 and we know that globally we are getting
  richer
 and as the middle class is on the rise so is our global population from seven billion of us today to nine point seven billion by two thousand and fifty 
 which means that by two thousand and fifty we are going to need at least seventy percent more protein than what is available to humankind today 
 and the latest prediction of the un puts that population number by the end of this century at eleven billion which means that we are going to need a lot more protein
 this challenge is staggering so much so that recently a team at anglia ruskin global sustainability institute suggested that if we don 't change our global policies and food 
  production systems  our societies might actually collapse in the next thirty years 
  at the same time our global fisheries are two and a half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support  meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace  
 wwf recently published a report showing that just in the last forty years  our global marine life has been slashed in half 
 and another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species such as
  swordfish and bluefin tuna over ninety percent has disappeared since 
 and there are a lot of great sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better managed fisheries  but ultimately all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant  
 it 's unlikely  even with the
  that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today  
 we have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have we need to alleviate the pressure on it and we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce  we might face total collapse 
 our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population 
 so how do we fix this what 's the world going to look
  short years when there 's two point seven billion more of us sharing the same resources  
 we could all become vegan  
 sounds like a great idea  but it 's not realistic and it 's impossibly hard to mandate globally 
 people are eating animal protein whether we like it or not 
 and suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path  
 failing to meet demands the world health organization recently reported that eight hundred million people
 are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage
  is due to that same growing global population and the declining access to resources like water energy
 and land 
 it takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest riots and further malnutrition people are hungry  
 and we are running dangerously low on natural resources 
  we need to change our global food production systems  we must do better and there is a solution and that solution lies in aquaculture
 the farming of fish plants like seaweed shellfish and crustaceans  
 as the great ocean hero jacques cousteau once said we must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters that 's what civilization is all about farming instead of hunting 
 fish is the last food that we hunt  and why is it that we keep hearing phrases like
 life 's too short for farmed fish or wild caught of course over fish that we know virtually nothing about we don 't know what it ate during its lifetime  and we don 't know what pollution it encounters 
 and if it was a large predatory species it might have gone through the coast of fukushima yesterday  
  never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal  but let 's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice  
 it 's healthy  it prevents heart disease it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like 
 omega 3s which is very different from almost any other type of meat  and aside from being healthy  it 's also a lot more exciting and diverse  think about it most animal farming is pretty monotonous  cow is cow sheep is sheep pig 's pig 
 and poultry
  pretty much sums it up and then there 's five hundred species of fish being farmed currently 
 not that western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves but that 's beside that point 
 and you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that 's good for us good for the planet and good for the fish 
 i know i sound fish obsessed 
  let me explain  my brilliant partner and wife  amy novograntz and i got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago  
 we were inspired by sylvia earle who won the ted prize in two thousand and nine we actually met on mission blue i in the galapagos
  amy was there as the ted prize director me an entrepreneur from the netherlands and concerned citizen love to dive  passion for the oceans  
 mission blue truly changed our lives  we fell in love got married
 and we came
  away really inspired thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation something that was meant to last that could make a real difference
 and something that we could do together 
 little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming  
 but a few months after we got off the boat  we got to a meeting at conservation international where the director general of worldfish was talking about aquaculture
 asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture
 has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need  
 we were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn 't know more about this industry already and excited about
 the chance to help get it
  to talk about stats
 right now the amount of fish consumed globally  wild catch and farmed combined is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year  
 every single fishing vessel combined small and large across the globe together produce about sixty five million tons of wild caught seafood for human consumption 
 aquaculture this year for the first time in history actually produces more than what we catch from the wild  but now this
  is going to go up 
 in the next thirty five years  we are going to need an additional eighty five million tons to meet demand  
 which is one and a half times as much almost as what we catch globally out of our oceans  
 an enormous number  it 's safe to assume that that 's not going to come from the ocean  it needs to come from farming 
 and talk about farming for farming you need resources
 as a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive so does an animal 
 a cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost eight thousand liters of water to create just one pound of meat  
 experts agree that it 's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet we just don 't have enough feed or water 
 and we can 't keep cutting down rain forests for it 
 and fresh water
 planet earth has a very limited supply  we need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet 
 and now let 's compare that with fish farming 
 you can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed and depending on species  even less  and why is that well that
  and it needs very little water which is counterintuitive  but as we say  it swims in it but it hardly drinks it fish are the most 
 animal protein available to humankind  aside from
  how much we 've learned since 
 for example on top of that sixty five million tons that 's annually caught for human consumption there 's an additional thirty million tons caught for animal feed 
 mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that 's turned into fish meal and fish oil  this is madness
 sixty five percent of these fisheries globally are badly managed some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it it 's destroying our oceans the worst slavery
  issues imaginable are connected to it recently an article came out of stanford
 saying that if fifty percent of the world 's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal our oceans would be saved now think about that for a minute now we know
 that the oceans have far more problems they have pollution there 's acidification coral reef destruction and so on but it underlines the impact of our fisheries  and it underlines how interconnected
  everything is fisheries  aquaculture deforestation climate change food security and so on 
 in the search for alternatives the industry on a massive scale has reverted to plant based alternatives like soy  industrial chicken waste  blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on 
 and we understand where these choices come from but this is not the right approach
  it 's not sustainable  it 's not healthy have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean of course not 
 if you feed salmon soy with nothing else it literally explodes  salmon is a carnivore it has no way to digest soy  
 now fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to
  but it 's had a really bad reputation there
 's been excessive use of chemicals there 's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations  ecosystem destruction and pollution escaped fish breeding with wild populations altering the overall genetic pool  and then of course  
 as just mentioned  the unsustainable feed ingredients  
 how blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate whatever it was
  once you know you know you can 't go back it 's not fun we really need a transparent food system that we can trust that produces healthy food 
 but the good news is that decades of development
 and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better we can now farm fish without any of these issues 
 i think of agriculture before the green revolution
 we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution
  technologies means that we can now produce a feed that 's perfectly natural with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes  insects  seaweeds and  micro algae 
 healthy for the people healthy for the fish healthy for the planet 
 microbes for example can be a perfect alternative for high grade fish meal at scale
  first of all the perfect recycling because they 're grown on food waste but second  think of fly fishing and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed 
 you don 't need large tracts of land for it  and you don 't need to cut down rain forests for it 
 and microbes and insects are actually net water producers this revolution is starting as we speak it just needs scale 
  we can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled  natural conditions creating happy fish 
 i imagine for example a closed system
 that 's performing more efficiently than insect farming where you can produce healthy happy  delicious fish with little or no effluent almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint 
  system where you grow up to ten species next to each other off of each other mimicking nature 
 you need very little feed very little footprint i think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish for example there
 's great technologies popping up all over the globe  
 from alternatives to battle disease so we don 't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore to automated feeders
 that feel when the fish are hungry  so we can save on feed
  and create less pollution software systems that gather data across farms so we can improve farm practices there
 's really cool stuff happening all over the globe  
 and make no mistake all of these things are possible at a cost that 's competitive to what a farmer spends today  
 tomorrow there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing  
 so somebody needs to connect the dots and give these
  developments a big kick in the butt and that 's what we 've been working on the last couple of years  and that 's what we need to be working on together
 rethinking everything from the ground up  with a holistic view across the value chain connecting all these things across the globe alongside great entrepreneurs
 that are willing to share a collective vision now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable
  direction this industry is still young much of its growth is still ahead  it 's a big task  but not as far fetched as you might think it 's possible 
 so we need to take pressure off the ocean  
 we want to eat good and healthy and if we eat an animal  it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life we need to have a meal that we can trust live long lives 
  and this is not just for people in san francisco or northern europe this is for all of us  
 even in the poorest countries  it 's not just about money  people prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about we 're all the same 
 the day will come where people will realize no demand farmed fish on their plate that 's farmed well and that 's farmed healthy
 and refuse anything less  you can help
  speed this up  ask questions when you order seafood where does my fish come from  who raised it and what did it eat 
 information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available 
 and consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing  so every time you order  ask for detail
  that you really care about what you eat and what 's been given to you and eventually they will listen and all of us will benefit  thank you
