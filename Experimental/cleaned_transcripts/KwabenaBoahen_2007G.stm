  i got my first computer when i was a teenager growing up in accra
  to figure out how did this thing work i read about how the
 is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory the ram
 and the alu the arithmetic and logic unit  and i thought to myself this cpu really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving
 through the system but nobody was really worried about this
  when computers were first introduced  they were said to be a million times faster than neurons people were
 really excited they thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain  this is a quote actually from
 alan turing in thirty years it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person
  thousand and seven 
 it 's still not true 
 and so the question is why aren 't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain  
 what people didn 't realize and i 'm just beginning to realize right now is that we pay a huge price for the speed
 that we claim is a big advantage of these computers  let 's take a look at some numbers this
  is blue gene the fastest computer in the world it 's got one hundred and twenty thousand processors  they can basically process ten quadrillion bits of information per second that 's ten to the sixteenth 
 and they consume one and a half megawatts of power  so that would be really
  if you could add that to the production capacity in tanzania it would really boost the economy
 just to go back to the states  
 if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the states  you get one thousand two hundred households in the u s 
 that 's how much power this computer uses
 now let 's compare this with the brain  this is a picture of
  girlfriend 's brain rory is a graduate student at stanford he studies the brain using mri  
 and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned 
 so that 's true love right there now how much computation does the brain do i estimate ten to the sixteen bits per second which is actually
 about very similar to what blue
  so that 's the question the question is how much they are doing a similar amount of processing similar amount of data the question is how much
 energy or electricity does the brain use and it 's actually as much as your laptop computer it 's just ten watts
 so what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by one thousand two hundred houses the brain is doing with the energy consumed by
  so the question is how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency and let me just summarize so the bottom line the brain processes
 information using one hundred thousand times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have how
 is the brain able to do this 
 let 's just take a look about how the brain works and then i 'll compare that with how computers work  
 so this clip is from the pbs series the secret life of the brain it shows you these cells that
  process information they are called neurons  they send little pulses of electricity
 down their processes to each other  and where they contact each other those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other 
 that process is called a synapse  you 've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other about one hundred million of them  sending about
  you have all the data going through the central processing unit  and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck  
 whereas in the brain what you have is these neurons  and the data just really flows through a network
  of connections among the neurons there 's no bottleneck here it 's really a network
 in the literal sense of the word  the net is doing the work in the brain  if you just look at these two pictures these kind of
 words pop into your mind this is serial and it 's rigid it 's like cars on a freeway 
  everything has to happen in lockstep whereas this is parallel and it 's fluid information processing is very dynamic and adaptive  so i 'm not the first to figure this out
  is a quote from brian eno the problem with computers is that there is not enough africa in them 
 brian actually said this 
 and nobody was listening then but now people are beginning to listen because there 's a
 pressing technological problem that we face and
  take you through that a little bit
 in the in the next few slides  
 this is it 's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute
 in computers  and the devices that our brains use to compute the devices that computers use are what 's called a transistor
  electrode here called the gate  controls the flow of current from the source to the drain these two electrodes  
 and that current electrical current is carried by electrons just like
  in your house and so on and what
 you have here is when you actually turn on the gate  you get an increase in the amount of current and you get a steady flow of current  and when you turn off the gate  there 's no current flowing through the device 
 your computer uses
 this presence of presence of current to represent a one and the absence of current to represent a zero  
 now what 's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller  
 they no longer behave like this in fact they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use
  which is called an ion channel  and this is a little protein molecule i mean neurons have thousands of these 
 and it sits in the membrane of the cell and it 's got a pore in it  and these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore now this pore can open and close  
 but when it 's open  because these
 ions have to line up and
  one at a time you get a kind of sporadic not steady
 it 's a sporadic flow of current  
 and even when you close the pore which neurons can do  they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity
 even when it 's closed because these ions are so small  they can actually sneak through a few can sneak through at a time so what you have is that when the pore is open
  you get some current sometimes these are your ones but you 've got a few zeros thrown in and when it
 's closed you have a zero but you have a few ones thrown in 
 now this is starting to happen in transistors  and the reason why that 's happening is that 
 right now in two thousand and seven the technology that we are using
 a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously side by side in fact there 's about
  twelve electrons can all be flowing
 this way  
 and that means that a transistor corresponds to about twelve ion channels in parallel now in a few years time by two thousand and fifteen  we will shrink transistors so much this is what intel does to keep adding more cores
 onto the chip or your memory sticks that you have now can carry
  transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen and technology has really benefitted from that but what 's happening now is that
 in two thousand and fifteen the transistor is going to become so small 
 that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel  and that corresponds to a single ion channel  
 and you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion
  will turn on and off
 at random even when it 's supposed to be on and that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up and that 's going to crash your machine  so 
 we are at the stage where we don 't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices  and the only kind of thing the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain  
 ok so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory  it sends it into the processor
 or the alu and then it puts the result back into memory that 's the red path that 's highlighted 
 the way brains work i told you all you have got all these neurons  
 and the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons  so you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network
  and then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity 
 just by it flowing flowing through the network so you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern
 what you see here is that there 's these redundant connections  so if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered
  it doesn 't show up over here these two pieces can activate the missing part
 with these redundant connections 
 so even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero and it doesn 't show up there 's redundancy in the network that can actually
 recover the missing information  
 it makes the brain inherently robust 
 what you have here is a system where you store data locally and it 's brittle  because each of these steps has to be flawless  otherwise you lose that data 
 whereas in the brain you have a system
  that stores data in a distributed way and it 's robust  what i want to basically talk about is my dream  
 which is to build a computer that works like the brain
  this is something that we 've been working on for the last couple of years  and i 'm going to show you
 a system that we designed
 to model the retina which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your
  eyeball we
 didn 't do this
 by actually writing code like you do in a computer in fact
 the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the internet
 they want to compress the information they just want to send the changes what 's new in the image and so on and
  eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve to send to the rest of the brain 
 instead of doing this in software or doing those kinds of algorithms we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that 's called the retina 
  and they figured out all the different cells and they figured out the network and we just took that network
 the neurons are represented by little
 nodes or circuits on the chip  and the connections among the neurons are represented 
 actually modeled by transistors  and these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain
 it will give you the same kind of robust architecture that i described 
  is actually what our artificial eye looks like the retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here 
 and the chip i 'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at kareem zaghloul who 's the student who designed
 this chip  
 let me explain what you 're going to see  ok because it 's putting out different kinds of information it 's not as straightforward as a camera the retina chip extracts four different kinds of information it extracts
  regions with dark contrast  which will show up on the video as red  
 and it extracts regions with white or light contrast which will show up on the video as
 green  this is kareem 's dark eyes and that 's the white background that you see here  and then it also extracts movement when kareem moves his head to
  see this blue activity there it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image that 's where it 's going from dark to light 
 and you also see this yellow activity which represents regions where
 contrast is decreasing it 's going from light to dark and these four types of information
 your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it and nine hundred thousand of those fibers
  send these four types of information so we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve  what you notice here is that these
 snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse right it doesn 't light up green everywhere in the background  only on the edges  and then in the hair and so on 
 and this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send they want to make it very sparse because that file is smaller and this is what the retina is doing and it 's doing it just with the circuitry
  how this network of neurons that are interacting in there which we 've captured on the chip
  but the point that i want to make i 'll show you up here so this image here is going to look like these ones but here i 'll show you that we can reconstruct the image  so you know you can almost recognize kareem in that
 top part there
  the idea when you stand still you just see the the light and dark contrasts but when it 's moving back and forth 
 the retina picks up these changes and that 's why you know when you 're sitting here and something happens
 in your background you merely move your eyes to it there are these cells that detect
  you move your attention to it so those are very important for catching somebody who 's trying to sneak up on you 
 let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano  ok  this is a steel drum here that has been modified and
 that 's what happens when you put africa in a piano and what i would like us to do is put africa in the computer and come up with a new kind of computer
 that will generate
  question for you kwabena do you put together in your mind the work you 're doing 
 the future of africa this conference what connections
 can we make if any between them kwabena boahen yes like i said at the beginning i got my first computer when i was a teenager growing up
 in accra  and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it it was very brute force it was very
  inelegant i don 't think that i would 've had that reaction if i 'd grown up reading all this science fiction  hearing about 
  was called and just you know buying into this hype about computers i was coming at it from a different perspective 
 where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem and i think a lot of people in africa have this different
 i think that 's going to impact technology  and that 's going to impact how it 's going to evolve  and i think you 're going to be able to see use that infusion to come up with new things
  because you 're coming from a different perspective  i think we can contribute we can dream like everybody else
