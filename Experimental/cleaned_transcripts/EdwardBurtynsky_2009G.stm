  journey thirty years ago  
 and i worked in mines  and i realized that this was a world unseen  and i wanted through color and large format cameras and very large prints 
 to make a body of work that somehow became symbols
 of our use of the
  landscape how we use the land and to me this was
 a key component that somehow through this medium of photography which allows us to contemplate these landscapes 
 that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work  
 and after seventeen years of photographing large industrial landscapes it occurred to me that
 oil is underpinning the scale and speed because that
  is the speed at which we 're taking all our resources  and so then i went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil and
 what i want to do is is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction where we 're taking it from the ground refinement and that 's one chapter 
 the other chapter that i wanted to look at was how we use it our cities our cars our motorcultures where people gather
  around the vehicle as a celebration  
 and then the third one is this idea of the end of oil this entropic end where all of our parts of cars our tires oil filters 
 helicopters planes where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up 
 and to me  again photography was a way in which i could explore and research the world and find those places
 and another idea that i had as well that was brought forward
 by an ecologist he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of of gas and said well how much carbon it would take and how much
 organic material it was twenty three metric tons for one liter so whenever i fill up my gas i
 i think of that liter and how much carbon and i know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton but he did the calculations
 for our earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy from the photosynthetic growth it would take five hundred years of that growth to produce what we use the thirty billion
 barrels we use per year  and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society
  looking at
 thirty billion per year we look at our two largest suppliers saudi arabia and now canada with its dirty oil 
 and together they only form about fifteen years of supply the whole world at one point two trillion
 estimated reserves only gives us about forty five years so it 's not a question of if but a question of when
 peak oil will come upon us so to me using photography and i feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents
 our ways of thinking to begin to deal with what i think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time how to deal with our energy crisis
