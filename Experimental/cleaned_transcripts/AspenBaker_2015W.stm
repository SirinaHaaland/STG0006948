  it was the middle of summer and well past closing time in the downtown berkeley bar where my friend polly and i worked together as bartenders  
 usually at the end of our shift we had a drink
 but not that night i 'm pregnant not sure what i 'm going to do yet
 without hesitation she replied i 've had an abortion 
 before polly no one had ever told me that she 'd had an abortion i 'd
 graduated from college just a few months earlier and i was in a new relationship when i found out that i was pregnant 
 when i thought about my choices i honestly did not know how to decide what criteria i should use
  how would i know what the right decision was i worried that i would regret an abortion later  
 coming of age on the beaches of southern california i grew up in the middle of our nation 's abortion wars 
 i was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of roe  vs wade 
 our community was surfing christians we cared about god the less
  fortunate and the ocean everyone was pro life as a kid the idea of abortion made me so sad
 that i knew if i ever got pregnant i could never have one 
 and then i did 
 it was a step towards the unknown but polly had given me a very special gift  the knowledge that i wasn 't alone and the
  realization that abortion was something that we can talk about 
 abortion is common 
 according to the guttmacher institute one in three women in america will have an abortion in their lifetime
  but for the last few decades the dialogue around abortion in the united states has left little room
  's political and polarizing 
 but as much as abortion is hotly debated it 's still rare for us  whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people to talk with one another
 about the abortions that we have 
 there is a gap  between what happens in politics and what happens in real life and in that gap a battlefield mentality an are you with us or against us
 this isn 't just about abortion there are so many important issues that we can 't talk about 
 and so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life 
 there are two main ways to get started one way is to listen closely and the other way is to share
  share stories 
 so fifteen years ago i cofounded an organization called exhale to start listening to people who have had abortions 
 the first thing we did was create a talk line where women and men could call to get emotional support  
 free of judgment and politics believe it or not 
  we needed a new framework that could hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our talk line 
 the feminist who regrets her abortion 
 the catholic who is grateful for hers the personal experiences that weren 't fitting neatly into one box or the other
 we didn 't think it was right to ask women to pick a side we wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side
 as they were going through this deeply personal experience so we invented
  in the middle of our
  we were hearing
  going through this
  all the experiences that we
