  it 's something that since it was invented a year or two ago has given me untold happiness 
 a little bit of it i think is the nicotine but there 's something much bigger than that which is ever
  since in the uk they banned smoking in public places i 've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again 
 and the reason i only worked out just the other day  
 which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people 
 you don 't actually want to spend all the time talking  it 's really really tiring  sometimes you just want to stand there silently alone
  with your thoughts  sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window now
 the problem is when you can 't smoke  if you stand and stare out of the window on your own 
 you 're an antisocial friendless idiot 
 if you stand and stare out of the window on your own
  so the power of reframing things
 cannot be overstated what we have is exactly the same thing the same activity  but one of them makes you feel great
 and the other one with just a small change of posture makes you feel terrible
 i think one of the problems with classical economics is it 's absolutely preoccupied with reality  
 and reality isn 't a particularly good guide to human happiness  
 why for example are pensioners
 much happier
 than the young unemployed both of them after all are in exactly the same stage of life  you both have too much time on your hands and not much money
  but pensioners are reportedly very very happy  whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed 
 the reason i think is that the pensioners believe they 've chosen to be pensioners  whereas the young unemployed
 feel it 's been thrust upon them in england the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly
  and that 's because having a son who 's unemployed in manchester is really quite embarrassing  
 but having a son who 's unemployed in thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment 
 laughter but actually the power to re brand things to
  don 't actually much depend on what they really are but on how we view them
 i genuinely think can 't be overstated 
 there 's an experiment i think daniel pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has
 an electric floor  every now and then an electric shock
  is applied to the floor  which pains the dogs 
 the only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box and when it nuzzles the button the electric shock stops 
 the other dog doesn 't have the button  
 it 's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box  but it has no control over the circumstances 
 generally the first dog can be relatively content the second dog lapses into complete depression
 the circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives  
 it 's an interesting question
 we ask the question the whole debate in the western world is about the level of taxation  
 but i think there 's another debate to be asked which is the level of control we have over our tax money 
 that what costs us ten
  pounds in one context can be a curse what costs us ten pounds
 in a different context we may actually welcome you know pay twenty thousand pounds in tax
 toward health  and you 're merely feeling a mug pay twenty thousand pounds to endow a hospital ward  and you 're called a philanthropist 
 i 'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax
 'll give you one in return how you frame things really matters do you call it the bailout of greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to greece 
 because they are actually the same thing what you call them actually affects how you react to them 
  i think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest one of my great friends 
 a professor called nick chater who 's the professor of decision sciences in london  
 believes we should spend far less time looking into humanity 's hidden depths and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows  
 i think that 's true actually i think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do  
 but what we don 't have is a really good model of human psychology at least
 pre kahneman perhaps 
 we didn 't have a really good model of human psychology to put alongside models of engineering of neoclassical economics 
 so people who believed in psychological solutions didn 't have a model we didn 't have a framework 
 this is what warren buffett 's business partner charlie munger calls a latticework on which to hang your
  classical economists all had a very very robust existing latticework on which practically every idea could be hung 
 we merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model 
 and what that means is that 
 in looking at solutions we 've probably given too much priority to what i call technical engineering solutions newtonian solutions and not nearly enough to the psychological ones you know my example
  of the eurostar six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between paris and london by about forty minutes 
 for zero point zero one percent of this money you could have put wi fi on the trains  which wouldn 't have reduced the duration of the journey  but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefulness far more 
 for maybe ten percent of the money you could have paid all of the world 's top male and female supermodels to walk up and
  down the train handing out free  chteau ptrus to all the passengers 
 you 'd still have five million pounds in change and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down 
 why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically i think it 's because there 's an
  an asymmetry in the way we treat creative emotionally driven psychological ideas
 versus the way we treat rational numerical spreadsheet driven ideas 
 if you 're a creative person i think quite rightly you have to share all your ideas for approval with people much more rational than you 
 you have to go in and have a cost benefit analysis a feasibility study an roi study and so forth and i think that 's probably right  
 but this does not apply the other way around
  people who have an existing framework an economic framework an engineering framework
 feel that actually logic is its own answer  
 what they don 't say is well the numbers all seem to add up but before i present this idea i 'll show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better 
 and so we artificially i think prioritize what i 'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas an example
  of a great psychological idea the single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the london underground per pound spent came
 when they didn 't add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains they put dot matrix display boards on the platforms
 because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality its
  but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait 
 waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock is less frustrating and irritating than waiting four minutes knuckle biting going 
 when 's this train going to damn well arrive 
 here 's a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in korea 
 red traffic lights have a countdown delay  it 's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments  why because
  impatience and general irritation are massively reduced when you can actually see the the time you have to wait 
 in china not really understanding the principle behind this they applied the same principle to green traffic lights 
 which isn 't a great idea  you 're two hundred yards away you realize you 've got five seconds to go  you floor it 
  the koreans very assiduously did test both the accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights  it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights 
 this is all i 'm asking for really in human decision making is the consideration of these three things i 'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other i 'm merely saying that when you solve problems you should look at all three of these equally 
 and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle  if you actually look at a great business
  see all of these three things coming into play
 really successful businesses google is a great great technological success but it 's also based on a very good psychological insight 
 people believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else  it 's an innate
  ayelet fishbach has written a paper about this 
 everybody else at the time of google more or less was trying to be a portal  yes there 's a search function but you also have weather  sports scores  bits of news  
 google understood that if you 're just a search engine people assume you 're a very very good search engine 
 all of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television and in the shabbier end of the row of
 are these rather despised things called combined tv and dvd players 
 and we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things but we look at a combined tv and dvd player and we go uck 
 it 's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a dvd player so we walk out of the shops with one of each google is as much a psychological
 success as it is a technological one i propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn 't even realize were
  problems at all this is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics don 't give them twenty four white pills give them eighteen white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones
 it 's called chunking the likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle
  of the great mistakes i think of economics is it fails to understand that what something is whether it 's retirement  unemployment  cost
 is a function not only of its amount  but also its meaning 
 this is a toll crossing in britain  quite often queues happen at the tolls  sometimes you get very very severe queues  you could apply the same principle actually 
  to the security lanes in airports  what would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to
  cross the bridge but go through a lane that 's an express lane  it 's not an unreasonable thing to do it 's an economically efficient thing to do 
 time means more to some people than others  if you 're waiting trying to get to a job interview  you 'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the
 the fast lane if you 're on the way to visit your mother in law you 'd probably prefer 
  probably prefer to stay on the left 
 the only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution people hate it 
 because they think you 're deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue and why on earth should i pay to subsidize your incompetence 
 on the other hand change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company  it goes to charity 
 and the mental willingness to pay completely changes
 you have a relatively economically efficient solution  but one that actually meets with public approval and even a small degree of affection rather than being seen as bastardy  
 so where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money  
 actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount  but where i think that money
  is going  and i think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy  it could revolutionize the public services  it could actually change things quite significantly [ ludwig von mises is my hero ]
 here 's a guy you all need to study  
 he 's an austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in vienna  what was interesting about the austrian school
  grew up alongside freud and so they 're predominantly interested in psychology they believed that
 there was a discipline called praxeology which is a prior discipline to the study of economics praxeology is the study of human choice action and decision making 
 i think they 're right  
 i think the danger we have in today 's world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology but as charlie munger says
  behavioral i don 't know what the hell is 
 von mises  
 interestingly believes economics is just a subset of psychology  i think he just refers to economics as the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity 
 but von mises among many other things  i think
 uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation for the value of
  marketing the value of perceived value
 and the fact that we should treat it as being absolutely equivalent to any other kind of value 
 we tend to all of us even those of us who work in marketing think of value in two ways the real value which is when you make something in a factory or provide a service  
 and then there 's a dubious value which you create by changing the way people look at things  
 von mises completely rejected this distinction and he used this following analogy
  he referred to strange economists called the french physiocrats
 who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land so if you 're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer  you created true value if however you bought some wool 
  from the shepherd and charged a premium for converting it into a hat  you weren 't actually creating
  you were exploiting the shepherd 
 now von mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake with regard to advertising and marketing  
 he says if you run a restaurant there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor 
 one of them creates perhaps the primary product the thing we think we 're paying for the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product and the idea that one of them should have
  priority over the other is fundamentally wrong 
 try this quick thought experiment imagine a restaurant that serves michelin starred food but where the restaurant smells of sewage and there 's human feces on the floor 
 the best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further it 's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor 
  vital we understand this if that seems like a sort of strange abstruse thing in the uk the post office
 had a ninety eight percent success rate at delivering first class mail the next day 
 they decided this wasn 't good enough and they wanted to get it up to ninety nine 
 the effort to do that almost broke the organization 
  the same time you 'd gone and asked people what percentage of first class mail arrives the next day the average answer 
  or the modal answer would have been fifty to sixty percent now if your perception is much worse than your reality  what on earth are you doing
 trying to change the reality that 's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks  
 what you need to do is first of all tell people that  ninety eight percent
 of first class mail gets there the
  i would argue in britain there 's a much better frame of reference  which is to tell people that more first class mail arrives the next day in the uk than in germany  
 because generally in britain if you want to make us happy about something just tell us we do it better than the germans 
 choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely transformed it has to
  be said of the germans that
 the germans and the french are doing a brilliant job of creating a united europe  the only thing they didn 't expect is they 're uniting europe through a shared mild hatred of the french and germans
 but i 'm british that 's the way we like it 
 what you 'll also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky we can 't tell the difference
 between the quality of the food
 and the environment in which we consume it all of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted when you drive away your car feels as if it drives better 
 and the reason for this unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which i 'm not paying him for and i 'm unaware of is because perception is in any case leaky 
 analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than analgesics that are not branded i don 't just mean through reported pain
  reduction actual measured pain reduction and so perception
 actually is leaky in any case  so if you do something that 's perceptually bad in one respect you can damage the other thank you very much
