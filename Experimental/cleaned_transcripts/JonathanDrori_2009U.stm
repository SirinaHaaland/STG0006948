  all life depends on plants  let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds 
 just think for a moment it doesn 't matter whether you live in a small
  or you live in a big city  everything comes back to plants in the end 
 whether it 's for the food the medicine the fuel the construction the clothing all the obvious things  
 or whether it 's for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much  
 or whether it 's soil formation  or the effect on the atmosphere  or primary production  damn it even the books here are made out of plants  
 all these things they come back to plants  and without them we wouldn 't be here
  now plants are under threat they 're under threat because of changing climate  and they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us 
 and people like us want to do things that destroy plants and their habitats  
 and whether that 's because of food production  or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn 't be
  or because of habitats being used for other purposes all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt  or die  or move 
 and plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way  
 so if all human life depends on plants  doesn 't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them i think it does  and i want to tell you about a project to
  and the way that you save plants
 is by storing seeds 
 because seeds in all their diverse glory are plants ' futures all the genetic information for future generations of plants
 are held in seeds  so here is the building  it looks
 rather unassuming really but it goes down below ground many stories and it 's the largest seed bank in the world  it exists not only in southern england but distributed around the world
  to that this is a nuclear proof facility  god forbid that it should have to withstand that 
 so if you 're going to build a seed bank you have to decide what you 're going to store in it right  
 and we decided that what we want to store first of all are the species that are most under threat  and those are the dry land species 
 so first of all we did deals
 with fifty different countries it means negotiating with heads of state
 and with secretaries of state in fifty countries to sign treaties we have one hundred and twenty partner institutions all over the world in all those countries colored orange 
 people come from all over the world to learn  and then they go away and plan exactly how they 're going to collect these seeds they have thousands of people all over the world tagging 
  places where those plants are said to exist they search for them they find them in flower  and they go back when their
 seeds have arrived  and they collect the seeds all over the world 
 the seeds some of if is very untechnical you kind of shovel them all in to bags and
 dry them off you label them you do some high tech things here and there some low tech things here and there and the main thing is that you have to dry them
 very carefully at low temperature  and then you have to store them
  them at about minus twenty degrees c that 's about minus four fahrenheit i think with a very critically low moisture content and these seeds will be
 able to germinate we believe with many of the species in thousands of years
  and certainly in hundreds of years it 's no good storing the seeds if you don 't know they 're still viable so every ten years we do germination tests
 on every sample of seeds that we have 
 and this is a distributed network so all around the world people are doing the same thing  
 and that enables us to develop germination protocols that means that we know the right combination of heat and cold and the cycles that you have to get to make the seed germinate  
 and that is very
  and then we grow these things  and we tell people back in the countries where these seeds have come from look  actually we 're not just storing this to get the seeds later  but we can give you this information about how to
 germinate these difficult plants and that 's already happening so where have we got to i
 am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed that 's three thousand millionth seed
  ten percent of all plant species on the planet twenty four thousand species are safe thirty thousand species if we get the funding by next year
 twenty five percent of all the world 's plants  by two thousand and twenty 
 these are not not just crop plants as you might have seen stored in svalbard in norway fantastic work there this is
 at least one hundred times bigger we have thousands of collections that have been sent out
 all over the world
 drought tolerant forest species sent to pakistan and egypt especially 
 plants come here to the united states salt tolerant pasture species sent to australia the list goes on and on 
 these seeds are used for restoration so in habitats that have already been damaged
  like the tall grass prairie here in the usa  or in mined land in various countries restoration is already happening because of these species
 and because of this collection 
 some of these plants like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen they are down to the last few remaining members the one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck 
 that is down to about thirty last remaining trees  
  useful plant both for protein and for medicine
