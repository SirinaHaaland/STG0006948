  i learned about the haiti earthquake by skype my wife sent me a message
  across the u s felt i was afraid of a tsunami  what i didn 't realize was there was a greater terror
 in haiti  and that was building collapse
  we 've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in haiti 
 these are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake while i was making my way through the d r into
  the country this
 is the national palace the equivalent of the white house this is the largest supermarket in the caribbean
 at peak shopping time
  this is a nurses ' college
 there are three hundred nurses studying the general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed
 this is the ministry of economics and finance  
 we have all heard about the tremendous human loss
 in the earthquake in haiti  
 but we haven 't heard enough about why all those lives were lost  we haven 't heard about why the buildings failed
  after all it was the buildings not the earthquake that killed two hundred and twenty thousand people 
 that injured three hundred and thirty thousand 
 that displaced one point three million people 
 that cut off food and water and supplies
  and it was not a natural disaster
 it was a disaster of engineering
 aidg has worked in haiti since two thousand and seven
  providing engineering and business support to small businesses  and after the quake we started bringing in earthquake engineers
 to figure out why
  the buildings collapsed to examine what was safe and what wasn 't 
 working with minustah  which is the u n mission in haiti 
 with the ministry of public works with different ngos  we inspected over one thousand five hundred buildings  
 we inspected schools and private residencies  we inspected medical centers and food warehouses
  we inspected government buildings this is the ministry of justice  behind that door is the national judicial archives 
 the fellow in the door  andre filitrault who 's the
 director of the center for interdisciplinary earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives
  told me after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way that there is no new research here 
 there is nothing here that we don 't know the failure points were the same 
 walls and slabs not tied properly into columns that 's a roof slab hanging off the building
 cantilevered structures
  structures that were asymmetric that shook violently and came down  
 poor building materials not enough concrete not enough compression in the blocks 
 rebar that was smooth  
 rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away  now there 's a solution to all these problems  
 and we know
  how to build properly the proof of this came
 in chile  almost a month later  when eight point eight magnitude earthquake
 hit chile  that is five hundred times the power of the seven point zero
 that hit port au prince five hundred times the power yet only under
  a thousand casualties  
 adjusted for population density that is less than one percent of the impact of the haitian quake  
 what was the difference between chile and haiti  
 seismic standards and confined masonry
  acts as a whole walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together
 to support each other
 instead of breaking off into separate members and failing 
 if you look at this building in chile  
 it 's ripped in half but it 's not a pile of rubble  
 chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades right
  now aidg is working with kpff consulting engineers architecture for humanity to bring more confined masonry training
 into haiti  
 this is xantus daniel  he 's a mason just a general construction worker not a foreman who took one of our
  on his last job he was working with his boss and they started pouring the columns wrong
  he took his boss aside and he showed him the materials on confined masonry 
 he showed him you know we don 't have to do this wrong  it won 't cost us any more to do it the right way 
 and they redid that building they tied the rebar right they poured the columns
  and that building will be safe and every building that they build going forward
 will be safe to make sure these buildings are safe it 's not going to take policy
 it 's going to take reaching out
 to the masons on the ground
 and helping them learn the proper techniques now there are many groups doing this and the fellow in the vest there
  craig toten  
 he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this 
 through haiti rewired through build change architecture for humanity 
 there is the possibility to reach out
 to thirty thousand forty thousand masons across the country and create a
  movement of proper building 
 if you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it 's extremely affordable 
 for the billions spent
 on reconstruction you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime
  there are two ways that you can rebuild haiti 
 the way at the top is the way that haiti 's been building for decades  the way at the top
 is a poorly constructed building that will fail the way at the bottom is a confined masonry building where the walls are tied together the building
  and it will stand up to an earthquake for all the disaster there is an opportunity here
 to build better houses for the next generation  so that when the next earthquake hits it
 is a disaster but not a tragedy
