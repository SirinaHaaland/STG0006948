  it is a thrill
 to be here at at a conference that 's devoted to inspired by nature you can imagine and i 'm also thrilled to
 be in the foreplay section did you notice this section is foreplay  because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters
  which is the western grebe  you haven 't lived until you 've seen these guys do their courtship dance i was on bowman lake in glacier national park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it 
 and my partner and i have a rowing shell  
 and so we were rowing  
 and one of these western grebes came along and what they do for their courtship dance
 they go together  the two of them  the two mates  and they begin to run underwater  
 they paddle faster and faster and faster until they 're going so fast that they literally lift up
 out of the water and they 're standing upright sort of paddling the top of the water  and
 one of these grebes came along while we were rowing  and so
  and we 're moving really really quickly and this grebe i think sort of  mistaked us for
 a prospect  and started to run along the water next to us in a courtship dance
 for miles it would stop and then start and then stop
  i came this close to changing species
 at that moment  obviously life can teach us something
 in the entertainment section  life has a lot to teach us but what i 'd like to talk about
 today is what life might teach us in technology and in
 design 
 what 's happened since the book came out the book was mainly about research in biomimicry and what 's happened since then is architects designers engineers people who make our world 
  have started to call and say we want a biologist to sit at the design table
 'll come with a design challenge and we find
 the champion adapters in the natural world who might inspire us so this is a picture from a galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers 
 they purify wastewater and some of them were very resistant actually to being there 
 what they said to us at first was you know we
  an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old old technology called domestication this is
 learning something learning an idea from an organism and then applying it and
 so they still weren 't getting it so we went for a walk on the beach and i said well give me one of your
 big problems give me a design challenge  sustainability speed bump that 's keeping you from being sustainable  and they said scaling which is
 the build up of minerals inside of pipes  and they said you know what
  just like at your house mineral builds up and then the aperture closes  and we have to flush the pipes with toxins or we have to dig them up 
 so if we had some way to stop this scaling and so i picked up
 some shells on the beach and i asked them what is scaling what 's inside your pipes and they said calcium carbonate  
 and i said that 's what this is  this is calcium carbonate 
  and they didn 't know that they didn 't know that what what a seashell is it 's templated by proteins  and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place
 to create a shell  so the same sort of a process without the proteins is happening on the inside of their pipes they didn 't know  
 this is not for lack of information it 's a lack of integration you know
 it 's a silo people in silos  they didn 't know that the same thing was happening so
  one of them thought about it and said  ok well if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater self assembly
 then why aren 't shells infinite in size what stops the scaling  why don 't they just keep on going and i said well in the same way
  and then they all sort of leaned in
 they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization it literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal and in fact there is a product called tpa
 that 's mimicked that
 protein that stop protein and it 's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes  that changed everything from then on
 you could not get these engineers back in the boat  the first day
 they would take a hike  and it was click click click click five minutes later they were back in the boat we 're done  you know i 've seen that island 
 after this 
 they were crawling all over
  they would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel 
 what had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already
 solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve learning about the natural world
 is one thing learning from the natural world that 's the switch  that 's the profound switch  what they realized was that the answers
 to their questions are everywhere
 they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world three point eight billion
 years of field testing ten to thirty craig venter will probably tell you i think there 's a lot more than thirty million well adapted solutions the important thing for me
 is that these are solutions solved in context and the context is the earth
  context that we 're trying to solve
 our our problems in 
 so it 's the conscious emulation of life 's genius it 's not slavishly mimicking although al is trying to get the hairdo going it 's not a slavish 
 mimicry  it 's taking the design principles the genius of the natural
  and learning something from it now 
 in a group with so many it people i do have to mention what i 'm not going to talk about and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things on the software side 
 so there 's computers that protect themselves like an immune system and we 're learning from gene regulation and biological development and we 're learning from neural
  genetic algorithms evolutionary computing
 that 's on the software side  but what 's interesting to me
 is that we haven 't looked at this 
 as much  i mean these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that
 there 's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in silicon valley  
 so the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms
  of what life would call a success so what can we learn about making not just computers but everything  
 the plane you came in cars  the seats that you 're sitting on how do we redesign
 the world that we make the human made world 
 more importantly what should we ask in the next ten years  and there 's a lot of cool technologies out there
  that life has what 's the syllabus  
 three questions for me are key 
 how does life make things  this is the opposite  this is how we make things  it 's called heat beat and treat that 's what material scientists call it 
 and it 's carving things down from the top with ninety six percent waste left over
 and only four percent product you heat it up you beat it with high pressures
  pressures you use chemicals ok
 heat beat and treat 
 life can 't afford to do that how does life make things how does life make the most of things  that 's a geranium pollen 
 and
 its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily look at that shape life adds
  information to matter  
 in other words structure  it gives it information by adding information to matter  it gives it a function
 that 's different than without that
 structure and thirdly how does life make things disappear
  because life
 doesn 't really deal in things  there are no things in the natural world divorced
 from their systems 
 really quick syllabus as i 'm reading more and more now and following the story  
 there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences  
 and at the same time i 'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand
  challenges are the two groups are not talking to each other at all 
 what in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture 
 to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we 're in i
 'm going to try to go through twelve  really quickly  one that 's
  in terms of nanotechnology 
 back to that shell the shell is a self assembling material on the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater  it 's a layered structure that 's mineral and then polymer  
 and it makes it very very tough it 's twice as tough as our high tech ceramics 
 but what 's really interesting unlike our ceramics that are in kilns  it happens in seawater
  happens near  in and near the organism 's body
 this is
 sandia national labs a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self assembling coding process imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature
 by simply dipping something
  lifting it out of the liquid and having evaporation force
 the molecules in the liquid together so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works 
 imagine making all of our hard materials that way imagine spraying
 the precursors to a to a pv cell to a solar cell  onto
  into a layered structure that harvests light here 's an interesting one for the it world
 this is a diatom which is made of silicates  and so silicon which we make right now it 's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips
  is a bio mineralization process that 's now being mimicked 
  this is at uc santa barbara  look at these diatoms  this is from ernst haeckel 's work 
 imagine being able to and again it 's a templated process  and it solidifies out of a liquid process imagine being able to have that sort of structure
 coming out at room temperature imagine being able to make perfect lenses  on the left this is a brittle star
  it 's covered with lenses that
 the people at lucent technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever it 's one of the most distortion free lenses we know of and there 's many of them all over its entire body  
 what 's interesting  again is that it self assembles a woman named joanna aizenberg at lucent 
 is now learning to do this in a  in a low temperature process to create these sort of lenses she 's also looking at fiber optics that 's a
  sea sponge that has a fiber optic down at the very base of it there 's fiber optics that work better than ours actually 
 to move light  but you can tie them in a knot 
 they 're incredibly flexible  
 here 's another big idea co2 as a feedstock a guy named geoff coates at cornell 
  plants do not see see co2 as the biggest poison of our time  we see it that way plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose  
 right 
 out of co2 he 's found a way he 's found a catalyst and he 's found a way to take co2 and make it into polycarbonates biodegradable plastics out of
 co2 how plant like solar transformations the most exciting one there are people who are mimicking the
 of purple bacterium the people at asu even more interesting lately in the last couple of weeks people have seen that
 there 's an enzyme called hydrogenase that 's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons  and is able to take hydrogen up basically what 's happening
 in a fuel cell in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell  in our fuel cells we do
  with platinum life does it with a very very common iron and a team has now just been able to mimic that
 hydrogenase that 's very exciting for fuel cells to be able to do that without platinum  power of shape here
  we 've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them  and those little bumps actually increase
 efficiency
 in for instance the edge of an airplane increase efficiency by about thirty two percent  
 which is an amazing fossil fuel savings if we were to just put that on the on the edge
 of a wing color without pigments
  this peacock is creating color with shape light comes through it bounces back off the layers  it 's called thin film interference imagine being able to self assemble products with the last few layers
 playing with light to create color imagine being able to create a shape on the outside
 of a surface  so that it 's self cleaning with just water that 's what a
  a ball of water  and those are dirt particles  and that 's an up close picture of a lotus leaf there 's a company
 making a product called lotusan which mimics when the building facade paint dries it mimics the bumps in  a self cleaning leaf and rainwater cleans the building 
 water
  is going to be
 our big grand challenge quenching thirst here are two organisms that pull water  the one on the left is the namibian beetle pulling water out of fog 
 the one on the right is a pill bug pulls water out of air does not drink fresh water  pulling water out of monterey fog
 and out of
 the sweaty air in atlanta before it gets into a building are key technologies
  separation technologies are going to be extremely important what if we were to say no more hard rock mining 
 what if we were to separate out metals
 from waste streams small amounts of metals in water  that 's what microbes do they chelate metals out of water there 's a company here in san francisco called
  mimics of the microbes ' molecules on filters to mine waste streams  green chemistry
 is chemistry in water  we do chemistry in organic solvents  this is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider
 and the silk being formed from a spider isn 't that beautiful green chemistry is
 replacing
  our industrial chemistry with nature 's recipe book it 's not easy  because life uses only a subset
 of the elements in the periodic table  and we use all of them 
 even the toxic ones 
 to figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table and create
 miracle
  materials like that cell 
 is the task of green chemistry timed degradation 
 packaging that is good until you don 't want it to be good anymore and dissolves on cue  
 that 's a mussel you can find in the waters out here and the threads holding it to a rock are timed at exactly two years they begin to dissolve 
 healing 
 this is a good one
  guy over there is a tardigrade there is a problem with vaccines
 around the world not getting to patients and the reason is that
 the refrigeration somehow gets broken what 's called the cold chain gets broken a guy named bruce rosner
 looked at the tardigrade which dries out completely  and yet stays alive
  for months and months and months and is able to regenerate itself and he found a way to dry out vaccines
 encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells
 meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated they can be put in a
  this is a session about water learning about organisms that can do without water in order to create a vaccine
 that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration  i 'm not going to get to twelve  
 but what i am going to do is tell you that the most important
  besides all of these adaptations is the fact that these organisms
 have figured out a way
 to do the amazing things they do
 while taking care of the place that 's going to take care of their offspring 
 when they 're involved in foreplay  
 they 're thinking about something very very important and that 's having their genetic material
 remain ten
  thousand generations from now 
 and that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that 'll take care of their offspring  
 that 's the biggest design challenge  
 luckily  there are millions and millions of geniuses
 willing to gift us with their best
  version of ten eleven and twelve because we just your slides are so gorgeous
  ideas are so big i can 't stand to let you go down without seeing ten eleven and twelve jb ok put this ok i
 'll just hold this thing ok  great ok so that 's the healing one
 sensing and responding feedback is a huge thing this is a locust  there can be eighty million of them in a square kilometer  
 and yet they don 't collide with one another and yet we have three point six million car collisions a year
 right there 's a person at newcastle
 who has figured out that it 's a very large neuron and she 's actually figuring out how to make a collision avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust
  this is a huge and important one number eleven and that 's the growing fertility that means  you know net
  fertility farming we should be growing fertility and oh yes we get food too because we have to grow
 the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life 
 and really that 's what other organisms do as well in ensemble  that 's what whole ecosystems do they create more and more opportunities for life 
 our farming has done the opposite
  so farming based on how a prairie builds soil  ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range  
 even wastewater treatment
 based on how a marsh not only cleans the water  but creates incredibly sparkling productivity 
  is the simple design brief  i mean it looks simple because the system over three point eight billion years 
 has worked this out that is 
 those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places 
 are not around to tell us about it 
 that 's the twelfth one  life and this is the secret trick this is the magic trick life creates
  creates conditions conducive to life it builds soil  it cleans air  it cleans water  
 it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and i need to live  and it does that
 in the middle of having great foreplay
 and
 meeting their needs so it  it 's not mutually exclusive we have to find a way to meet our needs  while
 making of this place an eden
