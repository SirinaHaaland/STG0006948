  like at least twenty other people in a room of this size  
  do you dare raise your hand  and it sticks with us  it really does stick with us  because
 when we
 are treated that way we feel invisible sometimes or talked around and at 
 and as i started to look at people which is mostly all i did  
 i noticed that some people
 really wanted attention
 and
  recognition  
 remember i was young then  so what did they do what we still do perhaps too often we talk about ourselves  
 and yet there are other people i observed who had what i called a mutuality mindset in each situation they found a way to talk about us
  so my idea to reimagine the world is to see it one where we all become greater 
 with and for others  there 's no greater opportunity or call for action for us now
 than to become 
  who use best talents together more often for the greater good and accomplish things we couldn 't have done on our own  and i want to talk to you about that
  because even more than giving  even more
 than giving is the capacity for us to do something smarter together
 for the greater good
 that lifts us both up
 and that can scale that 's why i 'm sitting here but i also want to point something else out each one of you
 is better than anybody else at something 
 that disproves that popular notion that if you 're the smartest person in the room you
 're in the wrong room 
 laughter so let me tell you about a hollywood party i went to a couple years back and
  and we were soon talking about something that we both felt passionately about public art  
 and she had the fervent belief that every new building in los angeles
 should have public art in it she wanted a regulation for it and she fervently started who is here from chicago 
 she fervently started talking about these  bean shaped reflective sculptures in millennium
  and people would walk up to it
 and they 'd smile in the reflection of it and they 'd pose and they 'd vamp and they 'd take selfies together 
 and they 'd laugh  
 and as she was talking a thought came to my mind  i said i know someone you ought to meet  
 he 's getting out of san quentin in a couple of weeks 
 and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect he spent five years
  in solitary  and i met him because i gave a speech at san quentin and he 's articulate
 and he 's rather easy on the eyes
 because he 's buff he had workout regime he did every day 
 i think she was following me at that point  i said he 'd be an unexpected ally
  and not just that there 's james he 's an architect
 and he 's a professor  and he loves place making and place making is when you have those  mini plazas and those urban walkways
 and where they 're dotted with art where people draw and come up and talk sometimes  i think they 'd make good allies  
 and indeed
 they were they met together 
  they spoke in front of the los angeles city council 
 and the council members not only passed the regulation half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards 
 they were startling  compelling
 and credible you can 't buy that 
 what i 'm asking you to consider is what kind of opportunity makers we might become because more than wealth
 or fancy titles
 or
 a lot of contacts it 's our capacity to connect around each other 's better side and bring it out  and i 'm not saying this is easy 
 and i 'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with 
 but what i want to suggest is this is an opportunity
  i started thinking about it way back when i was a wall street journal reporter and i was in europe and i was supposed to cover trends and trends that transcended
 business or politics or lifestyle  so i had to have contacts in different worlds very different than mine because otherwise you couldn 't spot the trends 
  and third i had to write the story in a way stepping into the reader 's shoes so they could see how these trends could affect their lives
  do and here 's a strange thing unlike an increasing number of americans
 who are working and living and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme
  are actively seeking situations with people unlike them and they 're building
  relationships and because they do that 
 they have trusted relationships where they can bring the right team in and recruit them to solve a problem better and faster and seize more opportunities  
 they 're not affronted
 by differences  
 they 're fascinated by them and that is a huge shift in mindset
  and once you feel it you want it to happen a lot more this world is calling out for us to have a collective
 mindset  and i believe in doing that it 's especially important now why is it important now  
 because things can be devised like drones
 and drugs and data collection and they can
  devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes
 and then as we know from the news every day they can be used for dangerous ones 
 it calls on us each of us to a higher calling 
 but here 's the icing on the cake it 's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that 's probably your greatest
  as an institution or an individual it
 's after you 've had that experience and you trust each other 
 it 's the unexpected things that you devise later on you never could have predicted for example  marty
 is the husband of that actress i mentioned  and he watched them when they were practicing and he was soon talking to wally my friend
  exercise regime  and he thought i have a set of racquetball courts that guy could teach it a lot of people who work there are members at my courts
  they 're frequent travelers they could practice in their hotel room no equipment provided 
 that 's how wally got hired not only that years later he was also teaching
  years after that he was teaching the racquetball teachers what i 'm suggesting is when you connect with people
 around a shared interest and action 
 you 're accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future  and i think that 's what we 're looking at 
 we open ourselves up to those opportunities  and in this room are key players in technology 
 key players who are uniquely
  positioned to do this to scale systems and projects together  
 so here 's what i 'm calling for you to do remember the three traits of 
 keep honing their top strength
 and they become pattern seekers  they get involved in different worlds than their worlds so they 're trusted and they
  can see those patterns  and they communicate to connect around sweet spots of shared interest so what i 'm asking you
 is the world is hungry i truly believe in my firsthand experience the world is hungry for us
 to unite together as 
 and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do i know that firsthand
 and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own 
 just remember  as dave liniger once said you can 't succeed
 coming to the potluck with only a fork
