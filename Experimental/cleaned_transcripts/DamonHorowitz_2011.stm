  's my student he 's about my age and he 's in san quentin state prison when tony was sixteen years old 
 one day  one moment it
 was mom 's gun just flash it scare the guy he 's a punk he took some money
  take his money that 'll teach him then last minute i 'm thinking ' can 't do this this is wrong ' my buddy says ' c 'mon let 's do this ' i say
 ' let 's do this ' 
 and those three words tony 's going to remember  because the next thing he knows he hears the pop there 's the punk on the ground puddle of blood and that 's felony murder
  to life parole at fifty if you 're lucky and tony 's not feeling very lucky  
 so when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and i say in this class we will discuss the foundations of ethics tony interrupts me 
 what are you going to teach me about right and wrong  
 i know what is wrong  i have done wrong  i am told every day by every face i see  every wall i face that i am wrong  
 if i ever get out of here there will always be a mark by my name  i 'm a convict i am branded ' wrong ' what are you going to tell me about right and
  wrong so i say to tony 
 sorry  but it 's worse than you think 
 you think you know right and wrong then can you tell me what wrong is no don 't just give me an example  i want to know about wrongness itself the idea of wrong  what is that idea what makes something wrong
 how do we know that it 's wrong  maybe you and i disagree maybe one of us is wrong about the
  maybe it 's you maybe it 's me but we 're not here to trade opinions  everyone 's got an opinion we are here for knowledge our enemy is thoughtlessness this is philosophy 
 and something changes for tony 
 could be i 'm wrong  i 'm tired of being wrong  i want to know what is wrong  i want to know what i know 
 what tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy
 the project that begins in wonder what kant called admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within what can creatures like us know of such things 
 it is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence what heidegger called the always already there 
 it is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it what socrates called the examined
  a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing  socrates died in prison  
 his philosophy intact  
 so tony starts doing his homework  he learns his whys and wherefores his causes and correlations his logic his fallacies  turns out tony 's got the philosophy muscle his body is in prison but his mind is free 
 tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous the epistemologically anxious the ethically dubious the metaphysically
  that 's plato descartes nietzsche and bill clinton so
 when he gives me his final paper in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure i say 
 i don 't know let us think about that because in that moment there 's no mark by
  just the two of us standing there it is not professor and convict it is just two minds ready to do philosophy and i say to tony let 's do this
