  i met in florence a professor carlo pedretti my former
 professor of art history  and today a world renowned scholar
 of leonardo da vinci  well  he asked me if i could find some technological way
 to unfold
 a five centuries old mystery
 related to
 a lost masterpiece by leonardo da vinci the battle of anghiari which is supposed to be located
 in the hall of the five hundred in palazzo vecchio in florence  well  
 in the mid ' 70s there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me  especially in italy  and so i decided with
 some researchers from the united states and the university of florence to start probing
 the murals
 decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the five hundred searching for the lost leonardo  unfortunately at that time
 we did not know that
 that was not exactly where we should be looking
 because we had to go much deeper in  and so the research came to a halt  and it was only taken up in two thousand thanks to the
  interest and the enthusiasm of the guinness family  well  this time we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the hall of the five hundred was before the remodeling  
 and the so called sala grande  which was built in one thousand four hundred and ninety four and to find out the original doors windows  and
 in order to do that we first created a
  and then with thermography we went on to discover hidden windows these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande 
 we also found out about the height of the ceiling  and we managed to reconstruct therefore all the layout of this original hall
 the way it was before there came vasari  and restructured the whole thing  including
 a staircase that that was very important in order to precisely place the battle of
 on a specific area
 of one of the two walls  well  we also learned that vasari  who was commissioned to remodel the hall of the five hundred between one thousand five hundred and sixty 
 by the grand duke cosimo i of the medici family  we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically
 by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap
 one that we [ see ] here masaccio the church of santa maria novella in florence 
 so we just said well maybe visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci and so
 we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls
 and searching for
 an air gap  and we did find
  many on the right panel of the east wall an air gap  and
 that 's where we believe the battle of anghiari or at least the part that we know has been painted which is called the fight for the standard should be located  well
 from there  unfortunately in two thousand and four the project
 came to a halt  many political reasons so i decided to go back to my alma mater and
  the university of california san diego and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for
 cultural heritage  
 and in two thousand and seven we created  cisa3
 as a research center for cultural heritage specifically art architecture and archaeology so students started to flow in and we started to build technologies because that 's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and go and do fieldwork
  we came back in the hall of the five hundred in two thousand and eleven 
 and this time with a great group of students and my colleague professor falko kuester who is now the director at cisa3 
 and we
 came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left 
  we were confined though  limited i should rather say for several reasons that it 's not worth explaining to endoscopy only of the many other options we had  
 and with a 4mm camera attached to it  we were successful
 in
 documenting and
 taking some fragments of
 what it turns out to be a reddish
  black color and there is some beige fragments that later on
 we ran a much more sophisticated exams  xrf  x ray diffraction 
 and the results are very positive so far it seems to indicate that indeed
 we have found some pigments and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before vasari came in about sixty years
  those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to leonardo  well  we are searching for the highest
 and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind  as a matter of fact  this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever
 had and for doing
 this great masterpiece he was named the number one artist influence at
  i had also had the privilege since the last thirty seven years
 to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me but basically to do what well to assess for example the state of conservation see here the face of the
 madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another different lady 
 aged lady i should rather say there is a lot of varnish still sitting there
  several retouches and some over cleaning  it becomes very visible  but also technology has helped to write new pages of our history or at least to update pages of our histories for example the lady with the unicorn another painting by rafael  
 well  you see the unicorn a lot has been said and written about the unicorn  but if you take an x ray of the unicorn it
  with the scientific examination of this painting came out
 that rafael did not paint the unicorn did not paint the puppy dog  actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the
 the exotic symbol of the unicorn unfortunately is not very reliable 
  just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art 
 there would be a cultural revolution to say the least but also i would say a market revolution let me add take this example  otto marseus  nice painting
  which is still life at the pitti gallery  and just have an infrared camera peering through 
 and luckily for art historians it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus it even says
 when it was made and also the location  so that was a good result 
  not that good  and so  again authenticity and science
 could go together and change the way 
 not attributions being made but at least lay the ground for a more objective  or i should rather say
  as it is done today  but i would say the discovery that really caught my imagination my admiration is
 the incredibly vivid drawing under this
 layer brown layer of the adoration of the magi here you see a handmade setting
 xyz scanner with an infrared camera put on it and just peering through this brown layer of this
  masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath 
 well this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci  and
 look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries look at these portraits  they 're magnificent you see leonardo at work
  you see the geniality of his creation  right
 directly on the ground layer of the panel  and see this cool thing  finding i should rather say
 an elephant because of this elephant  over seventy new images came out never seen for centuries 
 this was an epiphany  we came to understand and to prove
 that the brown coating that we see today was not done by leonardo da vinci  which left us only
  the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see so thanks only to
 technology  well  the tablet  well  we thought well  if we all have this pleasure this
 privilege to see all this to find all these discoveries what about for everybody else so we thought of
 an augmented reality application using a tablet let me show you just
  simulating what we could be doing  any of us could be doing  in a museum environment 
 so let 's say that we go to a museum with a tablet okay 
 and we just aim
 the camera of the tablet
 to the painting that we are interested to see
  and now
 let me turn to you so the moment the the image or i should say the camera has locked in the the painting then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded  
 and so
 see we can as we said we can zoom in then we can scroll 
 okay let 's go and
  all we need is one finger just wipe off and we see the elephant 
 and then if we want we can continue the scroll to find out for example on the staircase the whole iconography is going to be changed
  a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple  and there are a lot of figures showing up see 
 this is not just a curiosity because it changes not just the iconography as you see it  but the iconology  the meaning of the painting 
 and
 we believe this is a cool way easy way that everybody could have access to to become more the protagonist of your own
  and not just be so passive about it as we are when we walk through
 endless rooms of museums another concept is
 the digital clinical chart  which sounds very 
  obvious if we were to talk about real patients  but when we talk about works of art unfortunately it 's never been tapped as an idea  
  that this should be the beginning the very first step to do real conservation  and
 allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation  the technique materials and also if when and why we should
 restore or rather to intervene on on the environment
 surrounding the painting  well  our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance create a new discipline where engineering
  heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together  
 we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work
 and rediscover for us these values these cultural values that we badly need  especially today
