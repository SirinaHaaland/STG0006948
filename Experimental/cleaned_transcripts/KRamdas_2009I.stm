  good morning
 given my ted profile you might be expecting that i 'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends
 the one that 's currently got wall street and the world bank buzzing
 how to invest in women how to empower them how to save them
 not me
 i am interested in how women are saving us
 they 're saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities polarities we 've taken for granted for a long time like the ones between modernity and tradition
 first world and third world
 oppression and opportunity
 in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community
 there 's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing
 what intrigues me most is how women are doing this despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating why
  why is it that women are on the one hand viciously oppressed by cultural practices and yet at the same time are the preservers of cultures in most societies
 is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance
 when so many women and girls are beaten raped maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes honor
 religion nationality
 what allows women to replant trees to rebuild societies to lead radical non violent movements for social change
 is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing or are they one and the same
 are we guilty as chimamanda adichie reminded us at a ted conference in oxford of assuming that there is a
  single story of women 's struggles for their rights while there are in fact many and what if anything do men have to do with it
 much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions it 's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people
 in the process i 've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle
 among those
  who 've helped open my eyes to a third way are a devout muslim in afghanistan a group of harmonizing lesbians in croatia
 and a taboo breaker in liberia
 i 'm indebted to them as i am to my parents who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life were blessed with three daughters in this one and for reasons equally unclear to me seem to be
  inordinately proud of the three of us
 i was born and raised here in india and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all
 poor things you only have three daughters but you 're young you could still try again
 my sense of outrage about women
  's rights
 was brought to a boil when i was about eleven
 my aunt an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman was widowed early
 a flock of relatives descended on her
 they took off her colorful sari they made her wear a white one
 they wiped her bindi off her forehead they broke her bangles
 her daughter
 rani a few years older than me
 sat in her lap bewildered not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother
 lat that night i heard my mother begging my father please do something ramu can 't you intervene
 and my father in a low voice muttering
 i 'm just the youngest brother there
 nothing i can do this is this is tradition
 that 's the night i learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world
 women don 't make those rules but they define us and they define our opportunities and our chances and men are effected by those rules too
 my father who had fought in three wars
 could not save his own sister from
  this suffering
 by eighteen under the excellent tutelage of my mother
 i was therefore as you might expect defiantly feminist
 on the streets chanting
  the time i got to beijing in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety five it was clear to me the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition
 soon after i returned from beijing i leaped at the chance to work for this wonderful organization founded by women to support women 's rights organizations around the globe
 but barely six months into my new job
  i met a woman who forced my to challenge all my assumptions her name is sakena yacoobi
 she walked into my office at a time when no one knew where afghanistan was in the united states
 she said to me it is not about the burka she was the most determined advocate for women 's rights i had ever heard she
  told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside afghanistan
 and that her organization the afghan institute for learning had started a school in pakistan
 she said the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires
 and strongly supports literacy
  the prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the koran for themselves
 had i heard right was a women 's rights advocate invoking religion
 but sakena defies labels she always wears a headscarf but i 've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze
 she starts every lecture with a prayer but she 's a single feisty financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off
 at the age of twelve she is also immensely pragmatic
 this headscarf and these clothes she says
 give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work
 when i had to open the school in the refugee camp i went to see the imam i told him i 'm a believer and women and children in these terrible
  conditions need their faith to survive
 she smiled slyly he was flattered
 he began to come twice a week to my center
 because women could not go to the mosque and after he would leave women and girls would stay behind
 we began with a small literacy class to read the koran then a math class then an english class then computer classes in a few weeks everyone
  in the refugee camp was in our classes sakena is a teacher
 at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in afghanistan
 she is on the taliban 's hit list i worry about her every time she travels across that country she shrugs when i ask her about safety
 kavita jan we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid look at those young girls who go back
  to school when acid is thrown in their face and i smile and i nod realizing i 'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices
 turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity
 their path is their own and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different
 being different is something the women of lesbor in zagreb
  croatia know all too well
 to be a lesbian a dyke a homosexual in most parts of the world including right here in our country india
 is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice in post conflict societies like croatia where a hyper nationalism and religiousity
  have created an environment unbearable
 for anyone who might be considered a social outcast so enter a group of out dykes
 young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia from serbia to slovenia
 these folk singers met at college at a gender studies program
 many are in their twentys some are mothers many
  have struggled to come out to their communities in families religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick just queer
 as leah one of the founders of the group says
 i like traditional music very much i also like rock and roll so lesbor we blend the two
 i see traditional music like a kind of rebellion in which people can really speak their voice
 especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yugoslav republic after the war lots of these
  songs were lost but they 're a part of our childhood and our history and we should not forget them
 improbably this l g b t singing choir
 has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change like alchemists turning discord into harmony
 their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem
 a bosnian love song and serbian duets and leah adds with a
  grin
 kavita we are especially proud of our christmas music because it shows we are open to religious practices even though catholic church hates us l g b t
 their concerts draw from their own communities yes but also from an older generation a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality
 but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents
  one father who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir now writes songs for them
 in the middle ages troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses lesbor travels through the balkans like this
 singing connecting people divided by religion nationality and language bosnians croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride
 in their history and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all
  yesterday mallika sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given
 the world layma bowie was given was a world at war
 liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades layma was not an activist she was a mother of three but she was sick with worry
 she worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier she worried her daughters would be raped she worried for their lives
 one night she had a dream she dreamed she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed the next morning at church she asked others how they felt
 they were all tired of the fighting we need peace and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there
  peace among layma 's friends was a policewoman who was muslim she promised to raise the issue with her community
 at the next friday sermon the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs
 what does it matter they said a bullet doesn 't distinguish between a muslim and a christian this
 small group of women determined to bring an end to the war and they chose to use their traditions to make a point
 liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing
 but no for the protest they dressed all in white no makeup as layma said we wore the white saying we were out for peace
 they stood on the side of the road on which charles taylor 's motorcade passed every day they stood for weeks first just ten then twenty then fifty then hundreds of women wearing white singing
  dancing saying they were out for peace eventually opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana
 the peace talks dragged on and on and on layma and her sisters had had enough
 with their remaining funds they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building
  in a now famous cnn clip you can see them sitting on the ground their arms linked we know this in india it 's called a
 then things get tense the police are called in to physically remove the women
 as the senior officer approaches with a baton
 layma stands up with deliberation reaches her arms up over her head and begins very slowly to untie untie her headdress that covers her hair
 you can see the policeman 's face he looks
  embarrassed he backs away and the next thing you know the police have disappeared
 layma said to me later it 's the taboo you know in west africa
 if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to the man 's family is cursed
 she said i don 't know if he did
  it because he believed but he knew we were not going to leave we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed and the peace accord was signed and the women of liberia then mobilized 
  in support of ellen johnson sirleaf a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman
  liberia who allowed her to win against a football star that 's soccer for you americans
 no less
 women like sakena and leah and layma have humbled me and changed me
 and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind
 they 've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights
  into this third way
 a filipina activist once said to me how do you cook a rice cake with heat from the bottom and heat from the top
 the protests the marches the uncompromising position that women 's rights are human rights full stop
 that 's the heat from the bottom that 's malcolm x and the suffragists and gay pride parades but we also need the heat from
 and in most parts of the world that top is still controlled by men so to paraphrase marx women make change but not in circumstances of their own choosing
 they have to negotiate they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations and they need allies from their communities
 allies like the imam
  allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in croatia allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away
 allies like my father
 who couldn 't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams
 maybe this is because feminism unlike almost every other social movement is not
  against a distinct oppressor it 's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers
 it 's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women far too often hold ourselves
 and perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism
 that the personal is in fact the political so that as eleanor roosevelt said once of human rights the same is true of gender equality that it starts in small places close to home on the streets
  yes but also in negotiations at the kitchen table
 and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends
 and then
 and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles
 women like sakena and leah and layma but also
  gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile
 and shirin ebadi in iran
 are doing something else they 're challenging
 the very notion of western models of development they are saying we don 't have to be like you
 to make change we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou and we can be party leaders
  leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers we can use our tradition to navigate change we can demilitarize societies and pour 
  resources instead into reservoirs of genuine security
  is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities that i find hope
 and if my heart is singing it 's because in these little fragments every now and again you catch a glimpse of a whole
 of a whole new world and she is
  on her way thank you
