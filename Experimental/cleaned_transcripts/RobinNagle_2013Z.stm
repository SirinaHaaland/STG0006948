  i was about ten years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state
 it was a beautiful day the forest was sparkling
  the sun made the leaves glow like stained glass  and if it weren 't for the path
 we were following we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land  
 we got to our campsite  it was a lean to on a bluff looking over a crystal beautiful lake when i discovered a horror 
 behind the lean to was a dump  maybe forty feet square with rotting apple cores and
 and a dead sneaker  
 and i was astonished  
 i was very angry  and i was deeply confused the campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in who did they think would clean up after them 
 that question stayed with me  and it simplified a little who cleans up after
  however you configure or wherever you place the us who cleans up after us in istanbul who cleans up after us in rio
 or in paris or in london  
 here in new york 
 the department of sanitation cleans up after us to the tune of eleven thousand tons of garbage and two thousand tons of recyclables every day  
 i wanted to get to know them
  i wanted to understand who takes the job what 's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden so i started a research project with them  
 i rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city  and i learned a lot  
 but i was still an outsider  
 i needed to go deeper  so i took the job as a sanitation
  i didn 't just ride in the trucks now i drove the trucks and i operated the mechanical brooms and i plowed the snow  it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education 
 everyone asks about the smell  it 's there but it 's not as prevalent as you think and on days when it is really bad you get used to it rather quickly 
 the weight
 takes a long time to get used to i knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your
  body tons of trash every week 
 then there 's the danger  according to the bureau of labor statistics sanitation work is one of the ten most dangerous occupations in the country  
 and i learned why you
 're in and out of traffic all day and it 's zooming around you it just wants to get past you so it 's often the motorist is not paying attention
  that 's really bad for the worker  and then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm 
 i also learned about the relentlessness of trash when you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck 
 you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself it never stops coming it 's also like a form of respiration
  it must always be in motion  
 and then there 's the stigma you put on the uniform 
 and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you 've blocked traffic with your truck or you 're taking a break too close to their home or you 're drinking coffee in their diner 
 and they will come and scorn you and tell you that they don 't want you anywhere near them  
 i find the stigma especially ironic because i strongly believe that sanitation
  workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city for three reasons 
 they are the first guardians of public health 
 if they 're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day  it starts to spill out of its  containments 
 and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real
  diseases we 've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us 
 the economy needs them  if we can 't throw out the old stuff  
 we have no room for the new stuff  so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised  i 'm not advocating capitalism i 'm just pointing out their relationship  
 and then there 's what i call
 our average  
  by that i simply mean how fast we 're used to moving in the contemporary day and age  
 we usually don 't care for repair clean carry around our coffee cup 
 our shopping bag our bottle of water  we use them  we throw them out we forget about them  because we know there 's a workforce on the other side that 's going to take it all away  
 so i want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that
 will perhaps help
 ameliorate the stigma
 and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane 
 their work i think is kind of liturgical 
 they 're on the streets every day  rhythmically  they wear a uniform in many cities you know when to expect them  and their work lets
 us do our work 
 they are almost a form of reassurance the flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves from our own dross our cast offs and that flow must be maintained always no matter what 
 on the day after september eleven in two thousand and one  i
 i heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street  
 and i grabbed my infant son and i ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every wednesday  
 and i tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days  but i started to cry
  and he looked at me  and he just nodded  and he said we
 're going to be okay  
  a little while later that i started my research with sanitation and i met that man again his name is paulie  and we worked together many times  and we became good friends 
 i want to believe that paulie was right  we are going to be okay  
 but in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet  we must include and take
  the very real human cost of the labor  
 and we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about how do we create 
  systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling 
 states and countries around the world and lift us up to a broader horizon where we 're looking at other forms of waste
 that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources  municipal waste what we think of when we talk about garbage 
 accounts for three percent of the nation 's waste stream it 's a
 remarkable statistic  so
 in the flow of your days in the flow of your lives  next time you see someone whose job is
  clean up after you take a moment to acknowledge them  take a moment to say thank you
