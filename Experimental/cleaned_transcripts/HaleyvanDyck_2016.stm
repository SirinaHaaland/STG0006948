  i 'm here to talk to you today about a story that we have all been conditioned to believe is not possible  
 it 's a story about a living breathing start up flourishing in an unlikely environment the united states
  is fundamentally beginning to disrupt the way government does business from the inside out but before i get there let 's start with the problem 
 for me  the problem begins with a number one hundred and thirty seven 
 one hundred and thirty seven is the average number of days a veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the va one hundred and thirty seven days 
 now in order to file that application in the first place she has to navigate over one thousand different websites and over nine hundred
  different call in numbers all owned and operated by the united states government 
 now we live in times of incredible change the private sector is constantly changing and improving itself all the time 
 for that matter  it 's removing every single inconvenience in my life that i could possibly think of 
 i could be sitting on my couch in my apartment
  and from my phone i can order a warm gluten free meal that can arrive at my door in less than ten minutes  
 but meanwhile a working mother who depends on food stamps to support her family
 has to complete an arduous complicated application which she might not even be able to do online 
 and the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means that she might be having to take days or hours off of work that she can 't spare 
 and this growing dichotomy
 between the beneficiaries of the tech revolution and those it 's left behind is one of the greatest challenges of our time 
 because government 's failure to deliver digital services that work is disproportionately impacting the very people who
  it 's impacting the students trying to go to college the single mothers trying to get health care the veterans coming home from battle they can 't get what they need when they need it 
 and for these americans government is more than just a presidential election every four years 
 government is a lifeline that provides services they need and depend on and deserve  
 which is quite frankly  why government needs to get its shit together and catch up
  this wasn 't always a problem i was passionate about when i joined president obama 's campaign in two thousand and eight we brought the tech industry 's best practices into politics 
 we earned more money we engaged more volunteers and we earned more votes than any political campaign in history  
 we were a cutting edge start up that changed the game of politics
  when the president asked a small group of us to bring that very same disruption directly into government  i knew it wasn 't going to be easy work but i was eager and showed up ready to get to work 
 now  on my first day in dc my first day in government  
 i walked into the office and they handed me a laptop and the laptop was running windows ninety eight i
 mean three entire presidential elections had come and gone since the government had updated the operating system on
  computer  three elections  
 which is when we realized this problem was a whole lot bigger than we ever could have imagined  let me paint the picture for you  
 the federal government is the largest institution in the world it spends over eighty six billion dollars a year eighty six billion on
  for context that is more than the entire venture capital industry spends annually on everything  
 now  the problem here is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for because 
 percent of federal it projects are over budget or behind schedule  ninety four percent for those of you keeping score yes the number ninety four is very close to one
  there 's another problem forty percent of those never end up seeing the light of day they are completely scrapped or abandoned  
 now  this is a very existentially painful moment for any organization  because it means as government continues to operate as it 's programmed to do failure is nearly inevitable 
 and when the status quo is the riskiest option that means there is simply no other choice than radical disruption
  so what do we do about it how do we fix this 
 well  the irony of all of this is that we actually don 't have to look any further than our backyard  because right here in america are the very ideas the very people who have swept our world into a radically different place than it was two decades ago  
 so
 what would it look like if it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans ' benefits as it is to order cat food to my house 
 what would it look like
 if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators who have disrupted our tech sector to come and disrupt their government  
 well my friends here 's where we get to talk about some of the exciting new formulas we 've discovered for creating change in government  
 enter the united states digital service the united states digital service
  a new network of start ups a team of teams  organizing themselves across government to create radical change  
 the mission of the united states digital service is to help government deliver world class digital services for students immigrants  children  the elderly everybody at dramatically lower
  we are essentially trying to build a more awesome government  for the people by the people today we don 't care thank you 
 who doesn 't want a more awesome government right  
 we don 't care about politics we care about making government work better  because it 's the only one we 've got 
 now  you can think
  pretty funny you can think of our team a little bit like the peace corps meets darpa meets seal team six we
 're like the peace corps for nerds but instead of traveling to crazy interesting far off places you spend a lot of time indoors behind computers  helping restore the fabric of our democracy 
 laughter now  this team our playbook for the united states digital service is pretty simple  
 the first play is we recruit the very best talent our country has to offer
 and recruit them for short tours of duty inside government  these are the very people who have helped build the products and companies that have made our tech sector amongst the most innovative in the world  
 second  we pair these incredible people from the tech core with the dedicated civil servants already inside government on the ground creating change  
 third  we strategically
  important services that government offers  and finally we give them massive air cover from the leadership inside the agencies all the way up to the president himself 
 to transform these services for the better  
 now  this team is beginning to disrupt how government does business from the inside out 
 if you study classic patterns of disruption one very common pattern is rather simple  it 's to take something
  that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it 's a radical departure from the status quo 
 think about what airbnb took that was normal from hospitality and revolutionized my apartment 
 the united states digital service is doing exactly that we are taking what silicon valley and the private sector has learned through a ton of hard
  digital services that delight users at lower cost and we 're applying that to government where it is a radical departure from the status quo  
 now  the good news is it 's starting to work
 we know this because we can already see the results from some of our early projects like the rescue effort of healthcare gov when that went off the rails  
 fixing healthcare gov was the first place that we ran this play and today we are taking that same play and scaling it across a large number
  of government 's most important citizen facing services  now  if i can take a moment
 and brag about the team for a second it is the highest concentration of badasses i could have ever dreamed of 
 we have top talent from google facebook amazon twitter and the likes all on staff today all choosing
  and what 's incredible is everybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent 
 and i might add by the way 
 over half of us are women 
 applause the best way to understand this strategy is actually to walk through a couple of examples of how it 's working out in the wild i 'm going to give you two examples
  first one is about immigration 
 this my friends is your typical immigration application  yes  you guessed it it 's almost entirely paper based 
 in the best case the application takes about six to eight months to process it is physically shipped thousands of miles thousands of miles between no less than six processing centers  
 now  little story 
 about a decade ago the government thought that if it brought this system online it could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service
 was a great idea  so  the typical government process began 
 six years and one point two billion dollars later no working product was delivered
 one point two billion with a b now at this point the agency responsible us citizenship and immigration services 
 could have kept pouring money into the failing program  sadly that 's what often happens that 's the status quo today  
 but they didn 't the dedicated civil servants inside the agency decided to stand up and call for change we deployed a small team of just six people  and what many people don 't know is that 's the same size as the rescue effort of healthcare gov just six people 
 and that team jumped in side by side to support the agency in transitioning this project into more modern business practices more modern development practices
  speak what that basically means is taking big multi year projects and breaking them up into bite sized chunks  so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks instead of waiting in a black box for years  
 so within less than three months of our team being on the ground we were already able to push our first products to production  
  this is used to file for your replacement green card 
 now for immigrant visa holders a replacement green card is a big deal your green card is your proof of identification it 's your work authorization it 's the proof that you can be here in this country 
  so waiting six months while the government processes the replacement is not cool  
  faster  it is cheaper and it 's a better user experience for the applicant and the government employees alike 
 another one quickly  last fall we just released a brand new practice civics test  so as part of becoming a us citizen you have to
  for anyone who has taken this test it can be quite the stressful process  
 so our team released a very easy simple to use tool in plain language to help people prepare to help ease their nerves to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their american dream  
 because all of this work all of this work on immigration is about taking complicated processes and making them more human 
 the other day one of the dedicated civil servants on the
  ground said something incredibly profound  she said that she 's never been this hopeful or optimistic about a project in her entire time in government  
 and she 's been doing this for thirty years 
 that is exactly the kind of hope and culture change we are trying to create
  for my second example i want to bring it back to
  and what we are doing to build them a va that is worthy of their service and their sacrifice  
 i 'm proud to say that just a few months ago we released a brand new beta of a new website
  a simple easy to use website that brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place one website not thousands 
  the site is a work in progress but it 's significant progress because it 's designed with the users who matter most  the veterans themselves this
  might sound incredibly obvious  because it should be but sadly this isn 't normal for government  far too often product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders who do their best to represent the interests of the user but they 're not necessarily the users themselves  
 so our team at the va went out we looked at the data  we talked to veterans themselves and we started simple and small with the two most important services that matter most to them 
 education benefits and disability benefits
 'm proud to say that they are live on the site today  and as the team continues to streamline more services they will be ported over here and the old sites shut down 
 to me  this is what change looks like in two thousand and sixteen
 when you walk out of the oval office the first time i was ever there i noticed a quote the president had embroidered on the rug
 's the classic jfk quote it says no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings 
 it 's true 
 we have the tools to solve these problems we have the tools to come together as a society as a country and to fix this together  
 yes  it 's hard  it 's particularly hard when we have to fight when we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things
 won 't change  but in my experience  it 's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing 
 because if we don 't do them who will 
 this is on us all of us together  because government is not an abstract institution or a concept 
 our government is us
  it is no longer a question of if change is possible  the question is not
