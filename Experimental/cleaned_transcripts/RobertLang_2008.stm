  my talk is flapping birds and space telescopes and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another but i hope by the end of these eighteen minutes you 'll see a little bit of a relation it ties to origami  so let me start what is origami
  most people think they know what origami is it 's this flapping birds toys
  cootie catchers that sort of thing and that is what origami used to be
  but it 's become something else it 's become an art form a form of sculpture  the common theme what makes it origami is folding is how we create the form you know
 it 's very old this is a plate from one thousand seven hundred and ninety seven it shows these women playing with these toys if you look close
  it 's this shape called a crane  every japanese kid learns how to fold that crane  so this art has been around for hundreds of years  and you would think something
 that 's been around that long so restrictive folding only
 everything that could be done has been done a long time ago  
 and that might have been the case  but in the twentieth century  
 a japanese folder named yoshizawa came along  and he created tens of thousands of new designs but even more importantly he created a language a way we could
  communicate a code of dots dashes and arrows harkening back to
 susan blackmore 's talk we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection and we know where that leads
  and where it has led in origami is to things like this 
 this is an origami figure
 one sheet no cuts folding only hundreds of folds this
  is origami and this shows where we 've gone in the modern world  naturalism detail you can get horns antlers even if you look close  cloven hooves 
  and it raises a question what changed and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art  which is
  to the art to discover the underlying laws and that leads to a very powerful tool the secret to productivity in so many fields and in origami
 is letting dead people do your work for you because what you can do is
 take your problem and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved and use their solutions  and i want to tell you how we did that in origami
 origami revolves around crease patterns the crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure  
 and you can 't just draw them arbitrarily they have to obey four simple laws and they 're very simple easy to understand the first law is two colorability you can color any crease pattern 
  with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting 
  vertex the number of mountain folds the number of valley folds always differs by two two more or two less 
 nothing else if
 you look at the angles around the fold you find that if you number the angles in a circle all the even numbered angles add up to a straight line all the odd numbered angles add up to a straight line  
 and if you look at how the layers stack you 'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets a sheet can never penetrate a
 so that 's four simple laws that 's all you need in origami all of origami comes from that and you 'd think can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity 
 but indeed the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin and yet they govern all of chemistry all of life all of history 
 if we obey these laws
  we can do amazing things  
 so in origami to obey these laws we can take simple patterns like this repeating pattern of folds called textures and by itself it 's nothing but if we follow 
  the laws of origami we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very very simple  but when we put it together we get something a little different
  to fold four hundred scales you can back off and just do a few things and add plates to the back of a turtle or toes  or you can ramp up and go up to fifty stars on a flag 
 with thirteen stripes  
 and if you want to go really crazy one thousand scales on a rattlesnake  and this guy 's on display downstairs so take a look if you get a chance 
 the most powerful tools in origami have related
  to how we get parts of creatures and i can put it in this simple equation we take an idea  
 combine it with a square  and you get an origami figure 
 laughter what matters is what we mean by those symbols and you might say can you really be that specific i mean a stag beetle it 's got two points for jaws it 's got antennae can you be that specific in the detail
  you really can 
 so how do we do that well we break it down into a few smaller steps  so let me stretch out that equation  i start with my idea  i abstract it what 's the most abstract form  it 's a stick figure  
 and from that stick figure i somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part
  bit of the subject a flap for every leg  and then once i have that folded shape that we call the base  
 you can make the legs narrower you can bend them you can turn it into the finished shape now the first step  pretty easy take an idea draw a stick figure  the last step is not 
  so hard  but that middle step going from the abstract description to the folded shape that 's hard  
  and fold something but we 're going to start small this base has a lot of flaps in it we 're going to learn how to make one flap 
 how would you make a single flap 
 take a square  fold it in half fold it in half fold it again until it gets long and narrow 
 and then we 'll say at the end of that that 's a flap i could use that for a leg an arm anything like that 
 what paper went into that flap well if i unfold it and go back to the crease pattern you can see
  that the upper left corner of that shape
 is the paper that went into the flap so that 's the flap and all the rest of the paper 's left over i can use it for something else well there
 are other ways of making a flap  
 there are other dimensions for flaps if i make the flaps skinnier i can use a bit less paper if i make the flap as skinny as possible i get
  to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed and you can see there it needs a quarter circle of paper to make a flap  
 there 's other ways of making flaps if i put the flap on the edge  it uses a half circle of paper and if i make the flap from the middle it uses a full circle so no matter how i make a flap  it needs some part of a circular region of paper  
 so now we 're ready to scale up what if i want to make something that has a lot of flaps
  what do i need i need a lot of circles and in the 
 origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles  
 and here 's where the dead people start to help us out  
 because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles i can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements  and i can use those patterns now to create
  origami shapes 
 so we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules that gives you the folds those folds fold into a base you shape 
  the base you get a folded shape in this case  a cockroach  
 it 's so simple that a computer could do it and you say
  how simple is that but computers you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms and with this we could so i wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called treemaker  and you can download it from my website it 's free it runs on all the major platforms even windows 
 and you just draw a stick figure  and it calculates the crease pattern it does the circle
  calculates the crease pattern  and if you use that stick figure that i just showed which you can kind of tell it 's a deer it 's got antlers
 you 'll get this crease pattern  and if you take this crease pattern you fold on the dotted lines you 'll get a base that you can then shape
 into a deer  
 with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted  
 and if you want a different deer  not a white tailed deer but you want a mule deer or an elk  you change the packing and you can do an elk  
 or you could do a moose
  any other kind of deer these techniques revolutionized this art we found we could do insects spiders which are close things with legs things with
 legs and wings 
 things with legs and antennae  and if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn 't interesting enough then you could do two praying mantises
 from a single uncut square  she 's eating him
  i call it snack time 
 and you can do more than just insects this you can you can put details toes and claws a grizzly bear has claws  
 this tree frog has toes actually lots of people in origami now put toes into their models toes have become an origami meme  because everyone 's doing it
 you can make multiple subjects so these are a couple of instrumentalists
  player
 from a single square the bass player from a single square  and if you say well  but the guitar bass that 's not so hot do a little more complicated instrument well then you could do an organ 
 and what this has allowed is the creation of
  i want exactly this and this and this 
 and you can go out and fold it and sometimes you create high art and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work but i want to show you some examples  everything you 'll see here 
 except the car is origami
  really was
  folded paper computers made things move  but these were all real folded objects that that we made
 and we can use this not just for visuals  but it turns out to be useful even in the real world  surprisingly origami and the structures that we 've developed in origami turn 
  out to have applications in medicine in science in space in the body consumer electronics and more and i want to show you some of these examples 
  by koryo miura a japanese engineer he
 studied a folding pattern and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure and he used it to design this 
  solar array it 's an artist 's rendition but it flew in a japanese telescope in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five 
 going up in space  it unfolds in two places it folds in thirds it 's a very simple pattern you wouldn 't even call that origami they certainly didn 't need to talk to origami 
  artists but if you want to go higher and go larger than this then you might need some origami  
  a lens the size of a football field there were two groups of people who were interested in this planetary scientists who want to look up 
 and then other people who wanted to look down 
 whether you look up or look down how do you get it up in space you 've got to get it up there in a rocket and rockets are small so you have to make it smaller how
  do you make a large sheet of glass smaller well  about the only way is to fold it up somehow so you have to do something like this this was a
 small model folded lens you divide up the panels you add flexures  but this pattern 's not going to work to get something one hundred meters down to a few meters 
 so the livermore engineers 
 wanting to make use of the work of dead people or perhaps live origamists
  said let 's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing so they
 looked into the origami community we got in touch with them and i started working with them  and we developed a pattern together
 that scales to arbitrarily large size but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat compact cylinder  and they adopted that for their first generation which was not one hundred meters it was a
 has about a quarter mile focal length and it works perfectly on its test range and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle 
 now there is other origami in space japan aerospace [ exploration ] agency flew a solar sail  and you can see here that the sail expands out and you can still see the fold lines 
 the problem that 's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet like at its destination  but needs to be small
  small for the journey  and that works whether you 're going into space  or whether you 're just going into a body  
 and this example is the latter this is a heart stent developed by zhong you at oxford university 
 it holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination but it needs to be much smaller for the trip
  your blood vessels and this stent folds down using an origami pattern based on a model called the water bomb base 
 airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space  and they want to do their design by simulation so they need to figure out how in a computer to flatten an airbag 
 and the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags
 to do their simulation and so they can do
 a simulation like this those are the origami creases forming and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out does it work  and that
 leads to a really
 interesting idea  you know where did these things come from well  the heart stent
 came from that little blow up box that you might have learned in elementary school
 's the same pattern  called the water bomb base the 
  algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects things with legs  
 the thing is that this often happens in math and science when you
  that you solve for aesthetic value only or to create something beautiful turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world  
 and as weird and surprising as it may sound origami may someday even save a life
