  you will understand nothing with my
 type of english it 's good for you because  you can can have a break
 after all these fantastic
  all the other guys  i feel like shit  
  i don 't know why i am here but  you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor  you arrive at the opera and they push you 
 you must sing 
 i don 't know 
 laughter so so because
 i have nothing to show nothing
  we shall try to speak about something else we can start  if you want by understanding it 's just to start it 's not interesting but
 how i work when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known
 a toothbrush 
 i don 't try to design the toothbrush i don 't try to say oh
 that will be a beautiful object or something like that  that doesn 't interest me because there is different types of design 
 the one we can call it the cynical design  that means the design invented by
  which is terrible it means the design must be just the weapon for marketing for producer to make
 product more sexy like that they sell more
  there is people like me who try to deserve to exist  
 and who are so ashamed to make this useless job who try to do it in
  make the object for the object but for the result for the profit profit
 for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush  i don 't think about
 owns this mouth  what is the life of the owner of this mouth  
 in what society [ does ] this guy live what civilization creates
 this society  what animal species
 creates this civilization when i arrive and i take one
  so intelligent
 when i arrive at the level of animal species that becomes real interesting me i have strictly no power to change anything 
  but when i come back  i can understand why i shall not do it because today
  there is things to see  there is things to see  there is the big challenge  the big challenge in front of us  because
 there is not a human production which exists
 outside of what i call the big image the big image is our story  
  our mutation our life  we must remember  and we can see that in any book of my son of ten years old  
 that life appears
 four billion years ago around four billion point two
  first soup bloop bloop bloop sort of dirty mud no life nothing
  we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean  and something of
  we become a monkey after we become what we are today
 we know and especially carolyn knows that
 when the sun will implode  
 the earth will burn explode i don 't know what and this is scheduled for four four billion years  
 yes she said something like that  ok  that means we are at half of
  it 's a beauty can you imagine it 's very symbolic  because the bacteria we was
 had no idea of what we are today  and today  we have no idea
 of what we shall be in four billion years  
 and this territory is fantastic  that is our poetry  that is our our beautiful story
  we don 't deeply understand if we don 't integrate
 that we are mutants  we completely miss the story  because every generation thinks
 we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know i am the man the final man you know 
  i am not sure of that because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is so many
  is obliged to be a genius  
 but everybody is obliged to participate  
 and to participate  for a mutant  there is a minimum of exercise a minimum of sport  we can say that 
 the first  if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision
  i can explain you i shall try  if you walk like that
 it 's ok it 's ok  you can walk but perhaps  because you walk
 with the eyes like that  you will not see oh there is a
 hole  and you will
  and you will die dangerous  that 's why perhaps you will try to
 have this angle of vision  ok  i can see if i found something up up  
 and they continue up up up  i raise
 the angle of vision  but it 's still very selfish
  of your eyes a little more
 you go i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can help you  
 i can design for you a new toothbrush  new toilet brush something like that  i live in society  i live in community  it 's ok
  this level
 the more you can raise
 this angle of view the more you will be important for the society the
 more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise to see far and
  like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation  that means intelligent people
 are in this angle  that is intelligence  from this to here that  it 's genius
 ptolemy  eratosthenes  einstein things like that  nobody 's obliged to be a genius it 's better but nobody 
 take care in this
  be a good mutant there is some danger there is some trap one trap the vertical  because at the vertical of us  if you look like that
  come back because after there is another trap  if you look like that  you look to the past  or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself  it 's called schizophrenia  and you are dead also  
 that 's why every morning now  because you are
  mutant you will raise your angle of view  
 out more of the horizontal you are an intelligence never forget
 like that
 we if we look from far we see our
 line of evolution 
 this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth  like that  but if you
  we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria  
 and it 's very important to know where we are  because some some cycle  there is a spot in the cycle  and
  i don 't say it was fantastic  but in the ' 80s there was not too much war  like that
 it was
 we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized in this case people like me
 are acceptable  we can say
  say it 's luxurious time we have time to think we have time to i don 't know what speak about art and things like that  it 's ok  
 we are in the light but sometimes  like today  
 we fall we fall so fast so fast to shadow  we fall so fast to barbaria
  many face of barbaria because it 's not the barbaria
 we have today  it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think  there is different type of barbaria  that 's why
  even i 'm sorry to say forget art forget all that  there is priority  there is urgency  you must go back to politics  you must go back to radicalization 
 i 'm sorry if  that 's not very english  you must go back to fight to battle  that 's why today i 'm so ashamed to make this job  that 's why i am here to try to do it the best possible but i know that
 even i do it the best possible
 because it 's not the right time  that 's why i say that i say
 that  
 because i repeat nothing exist if it 's not in the good reason  the reason of our
  but there is so many different other scenarios of other
  idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now 
 we are it 's almost done  we have just to finish the story  
 that is very very important and when you don 't understand really what 's happened  you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that
 back  back  back  back like that  and you can fall  and it 's very dangerous  no you must really understand that
