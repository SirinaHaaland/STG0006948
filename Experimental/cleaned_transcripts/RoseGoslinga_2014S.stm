  is known as the year of the cup  or the goro goro the goro goro
 is a cup used to measure two kilograms of maize flower on the market  and the maize flower is used to make ugali
  a polenta like cake that is eaten together with vegetables  
 both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most kenyan farms  which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm 
 one goro goro
 can feed three meals for an average family and in one thousand nine hundred and
  the whole harvest could fit in one goro goro it was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory 
 now today  i insure farmers against droughts like those in the year of the cup  
 or to be more specific  i insure the rains 
 i come from a family of missionaries who built hospitals in indonesia 
  and my father built a psychiatric hospital in tanzania this is me age five in front of that hospital 
 i don 't think they thought i 'd grow up to sell insurance 
 so let me tell you how that happened 
 in two thousand and eight  i was working for the ministry of agriculture of rwanda and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister  
 she launched an ambitious plan to start a green revolution in her country  and before we knew it we were importing tons of fertilizer and
  seed
 and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer and plant 
 a couple of weeks later the international monetary fund visited us and asked my minister 
 minister it 's great that you want to help farmers reach food security  but what if it doesn 't rain 
 my minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly i am going to pray for rain
 that ended the discussion 
 on the way back to the ministry in the car she turned around to me and said 
 rose you 've always been interested in finance go find us some insurance 
 it 's been six years since  and last year i was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over one hundred and eighty five thousand farmers in kenya and rwanda against
 they owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two euros in premium
 now traditional insurance doesn 't work with two to three euros of premium  because traditional insurance relies on farm visits 
 a farmer here in germany would be visited for the start of the season  halfway through and at the end and again if there was a loss to estimate the damages
  for a small scale farmer in the middle of africa  the maths of doing those visits simply don 't add up 
 so instead we rely on technology and data this satellite measures
 whether there were clouds or not  because think about it if there are clouds
  you might have some rain  but if there are no clouds then it 's actually impossible for it to rain  
 these images show the onset of the rains this season in kenya  you see that around march six the clouds move in and then disappear  
 and then around the march eleven the clouds really move in 
 that and those clouds 
  were the onset of the rains this year 
 this satellite covers the whole of africa and goes back as far as one thousand nine hundred and eighty four 
 and that 's important  because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last thirty years 
 you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future  and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought  
 the data alone isn 't enough we devise agronomic algorithms which
  tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when for example for maize at planting you need to have two days of rain for farmers to plant  
 and then it needs to rain once every two weeks for the crop to properly germinate  
 after that you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves
  whereas at flowering you need it to rain more frequently about once every ten days for the crop to form its cob 
 at the end of the season you actually don 't want it to rain  because rains then can damage the crop 
 devising such a cover
 is difficult  but it turned out the real challenge was selling insurance
  we set ourselves a modest target of five hundred farmers insured after our first
  season  after a couple of months ' intense marketing we had signed up the grand total of one hundred and eighty five farmers 
 i was disappointed and confounded  everybody kept telling me that farmers wanted insurance  
 but our prime customers simply weren 't buying they were waiting to see what would happen didn 't trust insurance companies
  thought i 've managed for so many years why would i buy insurance now 
 now many of you know microcredit  
 the method of providing small loans to poor people pioneered by muhammad yunus who won the nobel peace prize for his work with the grameen bank  
 turns out selling microcredit isn 't the same as selling insurance 
 for credit a farmer
  needs to earn the trust of a bank  and if it succeeds  the bank will advance him money 
 that 's an attractive proposition for insurance 
 the farmer needs to trust the insurance company and needs to advance the insurance company money it 's a
 very different value proposition  and so the
  of insurance has been slow with so far only four point four percent of africans taking up insurance in two thousand and twelve  
 and half of that number is in one country  south africa  
 we tried for some years selling insurance directly to farmers with very high marketing cost
 and very limited success then we realized that there were many organizations working with farmers 
  mobile phone companies  government agencies they were all providing loans to farmers  
 and often just before they 'd finalize the loan  the farmer would say 
 but what if it doesn 't rain how do you expect me to repay my loan 
 many of these organizations were taking on the risk themselves simply hoping that that year the worst wouldn 't happen 
 most of the organizations however
  were limiting their growth in agriculture they couldn 't take on this kind of risk 
 these organizations became our customers  
 and when combining credit and insurance  interesting things can happen  let me tell you one more story 
 at the start of february two thousand and twelve in western kenya the rains started and they started early
  and when rains start early farmers are encouraged because it usually means that the season is going to be good so they took out loans and planted 
 for the next three weeks there wasn 't a single drop of rain  and the crops that had germinated so well
 shriveled and died we 'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about six thousand farmers in that area
 and we called them up and said look we know about the drought  we 've got you we 'll
 give you two hundred thousand euros at the end of the season 
 they said wow that 's great but that 'll be late  
 could you give us the money now then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest
  so we convinced our insurance partners  and later that april these farmers replanted  
 we took the idea of replanting to a seed company and convinced them to price the cost of insurance into every bag of seed 
 and in every bag we packed a card that had a number on it  and when the farmers would open the card they
 'd text in that number and that number would actually help us to locate the farmer and allocate them to a satellite pixel 
 a satellite would then measure
 the rainfall for the next three weeks  and if it didn 't rain we 'd replace their seed 
 one of the first hold on i 'm not there 
 one of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was bosco mwinyi 
 we visited his farm later that august
 and i wish i could show you the smile on his
  face when he showed us his harvest because it warmed my heart and it made me realize why selling insurance can be a good thing
  but you know he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture so we had to zoom out a lot 
 insurance secured his harvest that
  i believe that today  we have all the tools to enable african farmers
 to take control of their own destiny  
 no more years of the cup  instead  i am looking forward to at least somehow the year of the insurance 
 or the year of the great harvest
