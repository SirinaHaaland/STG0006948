  so i 'm an artist  but a little bit of a peculiar one i don 't paint  i can 't draw 
 my shop teacher in high school wrote that i was a menace
 on my report card
 you probably don 't really want to see my photographs
  but there is one thing i know how to do i know how to program a computer i can code  
 and people will tell me that one hundred years ago  folks like me didn 't exist that it was impossible that art made with data is a new thing 
 it 's a product of our age it 's something that 's really important to think of as something that 's very
  that 's true  but there is an art form that 's been around
 for a very long time that 's really about using information abstract information 
 to make emotionally resonant pieces and it 's called music  
 we 've been making music for tens of thousands of years  right and if you think about what music is notes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies these things are algorithms these things are systems
 that are designed to unfold over time
  to make us feel  i came to the arts through music i was trained as a composer and about fifteen years ago i started making pieces
 that were designed to look at the intersection between sound and image 
 to use an image to unveil a musical structure or to use a sound to show you something interesting about something that 's usually
  so what you 're seeing on the screen is literally being drawn by the musical structure of the musicians onstage and there 's no accident that it looks like a plant because the underlying 
  algorithmic biology of the plant is what informed the musical structure in the first place  so once you know how to do this once you know how to code with media you can do some pretty cool stuff
 speed it up to one minute each and string them all together  
 and so in seventy five minutes i can show you the history of hollywood cinema  
 and what it really shows you is the history of editing in hollywood cinema so on the left  we 've got casablanca on the right we 've got chicago and you can see that casablanca is a little easier to read that 's because the average length of a cinematic shot in the
  seconds  and now it 's around six seconds  
 this is a project that was inspired by some work that was funded by the us federal government in the early 2000s to look at
 video footage and find a specific actor
 in any video
 and so i repurposed this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner
  which is britney spears i downloaded two thousand paparazzi photos of britney spears and trained my computer to find her face
 and her face alone  i can run any footage of her through it and will center her eyes
 in the frame and this sort of is a little double commentary about surveillance in our society we are very fraught with anxiety about being watched but then
 we obsess over celebrity what you 're seeing on the
  screen here is a collaboration i did with
 an artist named lin  amaris 
 what she did is is very simple to explain and describe but very hard to do she took seventy two minutes of activity 
  getting ready for a night out on the town and stretched it over three days and performed it on a
  traffic island in slow motion in new york city 
 i was there too with a film crew we filmed the whole thing and then we reversed the process speeding it up to seventy two minutes again 
 so it looks like she 's moving normally and the whole world is flying by 
 at a certain point i figured out that what i was doing was making portraits
  when you think about portraiture you tend to think about stuff like this the guy on the left is named gilbert stuart he
 's sort of the first real portraitist of the united states and on the right is
  his portrait of george washington from 
  lansdowne portrait and if you look at this painting there 's a lot of symbolism right we 've got a rainbow out the window we 've got a sword 
 we 've got a quill on the desk all of these things are meant to evoke george washington as the father of the nation 
 this is my portrait of george washington 
  this is an eye chart  only instead of letters they 're words  
 and what the words are is the sixty six words in george washington 's state of the union addresses that he uses more than any other president 
 so gentlemen has its own symbolism and its own rhetoric and it 's really kind of significant that that 's the word he used the most  
 this is the eye chart for george
  tells us a lot about american history and gives you a different insight than you would have looking at a series of paintings  these pieces
 provide a history lesson of the united states through the political rhetoric of its leaders ronald reagan spent a lot of time talking about deficits  
 bill clinton spent a lot of time talking about the century in which he would no longer be president but maybe
  his wife would be lyndon johnson
 was the first president to give his state of the union addresses on prime time television he began every paragraph with the word tonight 
 and richard nixon or more accurately his speechwriter a guy named william safire spent a lot of time thinking about language and making sure that his boss
 portrayed a rhetoric of honesty this project is shown as a series of monolithic sculptures
  series of light boxes  and it 's important to note that they 're to scale so if you stand twenty feet back and you can read between those two black lines you have twenty twenty vision 
 this is a portrait  and there 's a lot of these there 's a lot of ways to do this with with
 data i started looking for a way to think about
 how i can do a more democratic form of portraiture  something that 's more about my country and how it
 how it works  every ten years  we make a census in the united states we literally count people 
 find out who lives where what kind of jobs we 've got the language we speak at home and this is important stuff really important stuff 
 but it doesn 't really tell us who we are 
 it doesn 't tell us about our dreams and our aspirations and so in
  i decided to make my own census  and i started looking for a corpus of data that had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary americans and it turns out that there is such a corpus of data that 's just sitting there for the taking it
 's called online dating 
 so in two thousand and ten  i joined twenty one different online dating services as a gay man a straight man a gay woman and a straight woman in every zip code in america and downloaded about nineteen million people 's dating profiles
  percent of the adult population of the united states i have obsessive compulsive disorder this is going to become really freaking obvious just go with me
  so what i did was i sorted all this stuff by zip code
  and i looked at word analysis these are some dating profiles from two thousand and ten with the word lonely highlighted
  you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word you can see that appalachia is a pretty lonely place  
 you can also see that
 nebraska ain 't that funny  this is the kinky map so what 
 this is showing you is that the women in alaska need to get together with the men in southern new mexico and have a good time
  and i have this at a pretty granular level
  so i can tell you that the men in the eastern half of long island are way more interested in being spanked than men in the western half of long
 island this will be your one takeaway from this whole conference you 're going to remember that fact for like thirty years 
  when you bring this down to a cartographic level you can make maps and do the same trick i was doing with the eye charts you can replace the name of every city in the united states with the word people use more
 in that city than anywhere else if you 've ever dated anyone from seattle this makes perfect sense
  so los angeles is acting and san francisco is gay some are a little bit more heartbreaking in baton rouge they talk about being curvy downstream in new orleans they still talk about the flood  
 folks in the american capital will say they 're interesting people in baltimore maryland will say they 're afraid this is new jersey  i grew up somewhere between
  and new york city 's number one word is now as in now i 'm working as a waiter but actually i 'm an actor 
 or now i 'm a professor of engineering at nyu but actually i 'm an artist if you go upstate you see dinosaur that 's syracuse  the best place to eat in syracuse new york is a hell 's angels barbecue joint called dinosaur barbecue that
 's where you would take
  so that 's maybe a more democratic portrait and the idea was what if we made red state and blue state maps based on what we want to do on a friday night  this is 
 this is based on my email about five hundred thousand emails sent over twenty years  you can think of this as a quantified 
  so what i 'm doing is running a
  a physics equation based on my personal data you have to imagine everybody i 've ever corresponded with it started out in the middle and it exploded with a big bang
  and everybody has gravity to one another
  gravity based on how much they 've been emailing who they 've been emailing with and it also does sentimental analysis so if i say i love you you 're heavier to me 
 and you attract to my email addresses in the middle which act like mainline stars  
 and all the names are handwritten
 sometimes you do this data
 and this work with real time data to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city this
 is a walther ppk 9mm semiautomatic handgun that was used in a shooting in the french quarter of new orleans about two years ago on valentine 's day in an argument over parking those are my cigarettes this is
 the house where the shooting took place
  this project involved a little bit of engineering i 've got a bike chain rigged up as a cam shaft with a computer driving it
 that computer and the mechanism are buried in a box the gun 's on top welded to a steel plate there 's a wire going through
 to the trigger and the computer in the box is online it 's listening to the nine hundred and eleven feed of the new orleans police department so that anytime there 's a shooting reported in new orleans 
 the gun fires 
  there 's a blank so there 's no bullet there 's big light big noise and most importantly there 's a casing there
 's about five shootings a day in new orleans so over the four months this piece was installed the
 case filled up with bullets  
 you guys know what this is you call this data visualization 
 when you do it right it 's illuminating when you do it wrong it 's
  piece for you i spent the last summer
 as the artist in residence for times square 
 and times square in new york is literally the crossroads of the world one of the things people don 't notice about it is it 's the most instagrammed place on earth 
 about every five seconds someone commits a selfie in times square that 's seventeen thousand a day  and i have them all laughter
 these are some of them with their eyes
  centered every civilization will use the maximum level of technology available to make art and it 's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions about what that technology means and how it reflects our culture
 so i leave you with this we 're more than numbers we 're people and we have dreams and ideas and reducing us to statistics is something that 's done
 at our peril thank you very much
