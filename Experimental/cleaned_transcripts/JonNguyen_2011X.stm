  as a kid  i was fascinated with all things air and space i would watch nova on pbs our school would show bill nye the science guy
 when i was in elementary school my next door neighbor he gave me a book for my birthday it was an astronomy book
  i poured over that thing for hours on end  and it was a combination of all these things
 that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream  
 and part of that dream was i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft  well
  a number of years later  i graduated from ucla and i found myself at nasa working for the jet propulsion laboratory  
 and there our team was challenged
 to create a 3d visualization of the solar system 
 and today i want to show you what we 've done so far now the kicker is  everything i 'm about to do here
 you can do at home because we built this for the public for you guys to use so
  you 're looking at right now is the earth  you can see the united states and california and san diego  
 and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around now this isn 't new  anyone who 's used google earth has seen this before  
 but one thing we like to say in our group is  we do the opposite of google earth google earth goes from this view down to your backyard 
 we go from this view out to the stars
 so the earth is cool but what we really want to show are the spacecraft  
 so i 'm going to bring the interface back up 
 and now you 're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the earth these are a number of our science space earth orbiters  we haven 't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites 
  if we did it would be a complete mess because there 's a lot of stuff out there 
 and the cool thing is  we actually created 3d models for a number of these spacecraft  
 so if you want to visit any of these all you need to do is double click on them  so i 'm going to find the international space station
 double click and it will take us all the way down to the iss  
 and now you 're riding along with the iss where it is right now  
 and the other cool thing is
 not only can we move the camera around we can also control time  so i can slide this jog dial here
 to shuttle time forward  and now we can see what a sunset on the iss would look like 
 and they get one every ninety minutes 
 all right so what about the rest of
  i can click on this home button over here  and that will take us up to the inner solar system and now we 're looking at the rest of the solar system  you can see there 's saturn there 's jupiter
  and while we 're here i want to point out something  
 it 's actually pretty busy here we have the mars science laboratory on its way to mars just launched last weekend 
 here we have juno on its cruise to jupiter  there  we have dawn orbiting vesta  and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to
  pluto  and i mention this because
 there 's this strange public perception that nasa 's dead 
 that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there 's no more spacecraft out there  
 well a lot of what nasa does is robotic exploration  and we have a lot of spacecraft out there  granted we 're not sending humans
  with our own launch vehicles but nasa is far from dead  
 and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there 's so many other things that we 're doing  
 anyway while we 're here again if you want to visit anything all you need to do is double click so i 'm just going to  double click on vesta  
 and here we have dawn orbiting vesta  and this is happening right now  
  and we can see
 uranus rotating on its side along with its moons  you can see how it 's tilted at about eighty nine degrees  and
 just being able to visit different places and go through different times we have data from one thousand nine hundred and fifty to two thousand and fifty granted we don 't have everything in between because some of the data is hard to get 
 just being able to visit places in different times
 you can explore this for hours literally hours on end  
 but i want to show you one thing in particular  so i 'm going to open up the destination tab spacecraft outer planet missions voyager one 
 and i 'm going to bring up the titan flyby  
 so now we 've gone back in time
  we 're now riding along with voyager one the date here is november eleven one thousand nine hundred and eighty 
 now there 's a funny thing going on here  
 it doesn 't look like anything 's going on it looks like i 've paused the program  it 's actually running at real rate right now  one second per second and in fact voyager one here
 flying by titan at
 i think it 's thirty eight thousand miles per hour  it only looks like nothing 's moving because well saturn here is seven hundred thousand miles
  away  and titan here is four thousand to five thousand miles away it 's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing 's happening  
 but to make it more interesting i 'm going to speed up time  and we can watch as voyager one flies by titan 
 which is a hazy moon of saturn it actually has a very thick atmosphere  
 and i 'm going to recenter the camera on saturn here  
 i 'm going to pull out
  i want to show you
 voyager one as it flies by saturn  
 there 's a point to be made here with a 3d visualization like this 
 we can not only just say voyager one flew by saturn  there 's a whole story to tell here and even better because it 's an interactive application  you can tell the story for yourself 
 if you want to pause it  you can pause it if you want to keep going if you want to change the camera angle you can do that
 and because of that i can show you that voyager one doesn 't just fly by saturn  it actually flies
 underneath saturn  
 now what happens is as it flies underneath saturn  saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system  
 so if i just keep letting this go  
 you can see voyager one
 fly up
  like that and in fact i 'm going to go back to the solar system  i 'm going to go back to today now  and i want to show you where voyager one is 
 right there  
 above way above the solar system  way beyond our solar system 
 and here 's the thing now you know how it got there  now you know why and to me that 's the point of this program  you can
  manipulate it yourself  you can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself 
 you know the theme today is the world in your grasp well  we 're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp 
 and we hope once it 's there you 'll be able to learn for yourself what we 've done out there and what we 're about to do 
 and my personal dream is for kids
 to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired
  as i was as a kid to pursue stem education and to pursue a dream in space exploration
