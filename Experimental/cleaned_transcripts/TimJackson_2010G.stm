  i want to talk to you today about prosperity about our hopes for a shared
 and lasting prosperity and not just us but the two billion people worldwide who are still
  and hope actually is at the heart of this in fact the latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity 
 hope in accordance with our hopes and expectations  the irony is though that we have
 prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth and we 've grown our economies so much
 that we now stand in a real danger of
  undermining hope
 running down resources cutting down rainforests  spilling oil into the gulf of mexico changing the climate
 and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades
 is recession  and recession of
  isn 't exactly a recipe for hope either as we 're busy finding out so we 're caught in a kind of trap  
 it 's a dilemma a dilemma of growth  we can 't live with it we can 't live without it trash the system
 or crash the planet it 's a tough choice it isn 't much of a choice and our best avenue of escape from this actually is
 a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and
  and efficiency and doing things
 more efficiently now i haven 't got anything against efficiency and i think we are a clever species sometimes  
 but i think we should also just check the numbers take a reality check here so i want you to imagine a world in two thousand and fifty 
 of around nine billion people all aspiring to western incomes western lifestyles  and i want to ask the
  give them that two percent hike in income in salary each year as well because we believe in growth  
 and i want to ask the question how far and how fast would be have to move how clever would we have to be how much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets and here
 in my chart on the left hand side
 is where we are now this is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment it 's around about seven hundred and seventy grams of carbon in the
  world i describe to you we have to be right over here at the right hand side at six grams of carbon  it 's a 130 fold improvement and that is ten times further and faster than anything we 
  've ever achieved in industrial history  maybe we can do it maybe it 's possible who knows  maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere which is what we 're going to need to be doing by the end of the century  
 that the economic system that we have
 is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement so
 i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics it 's a bit complex and i apologize for that what i 'll try and do is i 'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms so it looks a little bit like this 
 firms produce goods for households that 's us and provide us with incomes  and that 's even better
  because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services that 's called the circular flow of the economy 
 it looks harmless enough i just want to highlight one key feature of this system which is the role of investment now
 investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies but it plays an absolutely vital role 
 and what it does essentially is to stimulate further
 consumption growth  it does this in a couple of ways chasing productivity which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff but i want to concentrate on
 the role of investment in seeking out novelty  the production and consumption of novelty  
 joseph schumpeter called this the process of
  it 's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty continually chasing expanding consumer markets consumer goods new consumer goods and this 
 this is where it gets interesting because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty  we love new stuff
 new material stuff for sure but also new ideas new adventures new experiences but the materiality matters too because in every society
  that anthropologists have looked at material stuff
 operates as a kind of language a language of goods a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories
 stories for example about how important we are
  conspicuous consumption
  thrives from the language of novelty  and here all of a sudden  we have a system
 that is locking economic structure with social logic
 the economic institutions and who we are as people locked together to drive an engine of growth  and this engine is not just economic value it is pulling material resources relentlessly
 through the system
  driven by our own insatiable appetites  driven in fact by a sense of anxiety  adam smith two hundred years ago spoke about
 our desire for a life without shame a life without shame in his day what that meant was a linen shirt  
 and today  well you still need the shirt but you need
 the hybrid car the hdtv two holidays a year in the sun the netbook and ipad the list goes on an almost inexhaustible supply
 of goods driven by this anxiety and even if we don 't want them 
 we need to buy them because if we don 't buy them the system crashes and to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades we 've expanded the money supply expanded credit and debt so that people can keep buying stuff 
 and of course that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis 
 but this i just want to show you some data here this is what it looks like essentially
 this credit and debt system just for the u k this was the last fifteen years before the crash and you can see there consumer debt rose dramatically it was above the gdp for three years in a row just before the crisis 
 and in the mean time  personal savings absolutely plummeted the savings ratio net savings were below zero in the middle of two thousand and eight
  just before the crash this is people expanding debt drawing down their savings just to stay in the game 
 this is a strange  rather perverse story just to put it in very simple terms  it 's a story about us people 
 being persuaded to
 spend money we don 't have on things we don 't need to create impressions that won 't last on people we don 't care
  before we consign ourselves to despair maybe we should just go back and say did we get this right is this really how people are is this really how economies behave and almost straightaway
 we actually run up against a couple of anomalies the first one is in the crisis itself in the crisis in the recession  what do people want to do they want to hunker down they want to look to the future they want to spend
  less and save more 
 but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view keynes called this the paradox of thrift saving slows down recovery 
 and politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt to draw down our own savings even further just so that we can get the show back on the road so we can keep this
  economy going it 's an anomaly it 's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people 
 here 's another one completely different one why is it
 that we don 't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change very very simple things like
 buying energy efficient appliances putting in efficient lights turning the lights off occasionally insulating our homes these things save carbon they save energy they save us
 money so is it
  it that though they make perfect economic sense we don 't do them well i had my own personal insight into this
 a few years ago it was a sunday evening sunday afternoon  and it was just after actually to be honest
  too long after we had moved into a new house  and i had finally got around to doing some draft stripping 
 installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts 
 then five year old daughter was helping me in the way that five year olds do  and we 'd been doing this for a while  when she turned to me very solemnly
 and said will this really keep out the giraffes 
 here they are the giraffes you can hear the
  mind working these ones interestingly are four hundred miles north of here outside
  in cumbria goodness knows what they make of the lake district weather but actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me because
 it suddenly became clear to me why we don 't do the blindingly obvious things we 're too busy keeping out the giraffes putting the kids on the bus in the morning getting ourselves to work on time surviving email overload and shop floor
  politics foraging for groceries throwing together meals 
 escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime time tv or or ted online 
 getting from one end of the day to the other keeping out the giraffes 
 laughter what is the objective
  what is the objective of the consumer 
 mary douglas asked in an essay on poverty written thirty five years ago it is she said 
 to help create the social world and find a credible place in it that is a
 a deeply humanizing vision of our lives  and it 's a completely different vision
 than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model
 so who are we 
 who are these people are we these novelty seeking hedonistic selfish individuals 
 or might we actually occasionally be
 something like the selfless altruist depicted in rembrandt 's lovely lovely sketch here  well psychology actually says
 there is a tension a tension between
 self regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors and these tensions
 have deep evolutionary roots so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances fight or flight  
 but other regarding behaviors
 are essential to our evolution as social beings and perhaps even more interesting from our point of view another tension between
  tradition or conservation 
 novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups 
 so here all of a sudden  we 're looking at a map of the human heart 
 and it
 reveals to us
  the crux of the matter what we 've done is we 've created economies 
 we 've created systems which systematically privilege  encourage one narrow quadrant of the human soul
 and left the others
 unregarded  
 and in the same token the solution becomes clear because this isn 't therefore about changing human nature  it isn 't  in fact about curtailing
 curtailing possibilities it is about opening up it is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect
 rembrandt 's fragile altruist within  what does all this mean for economics what would economies look like
 if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these
  orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche 
 well it might look a little bit like the four thousand community interest companies that have sprung up in the u k over the last five years and a similar rise in b corporations in the united states 
  enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at
  in fact like this one ecosia and i just want to very quickly show you this ecosia is an internet search engine internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search and ecosia works
 in pretty much the same way  so we can do that here we can just put in
 a little search term there you go oxford that 's where we are see what comes
  the difference with ecosia though is that in ecosia 's case it draws the revenues
 in the same way  but it allocates eighty percent of those revenues
 to a rainforest protection project in the amazon and we 're going to do it we 're just going to click on 
  case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession that 's the page to go to and what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to ecosia and ecosia is giving eighty percent of those revenues to
  a rainforest protection project it 's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources it 's a different kind of enterprise for 
 a new economy it 's a form if you like of ecological altruism
  do in fact is to
 put investment back into the heart of the model to re conceive investment only now investment isn 't going to be about
 the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth  investment has to be a different beast investment has to be
  in the new economy protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends  
 it has to be about transition it has to be investing in low carbon technologies
 and infrastructures we have to invest in fact 
 in the idea of a meaningful prosperity  providing capabilities for people to flourish  and of
  this task has material dimensions it would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn 't have food clothing and shelter but it 's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this it has social and psychological aims
 family  friendship commitments society participating in the life of that society and this too requires 
 investment investment for example in places places where we can connect  
  participate shared spaces  
 concert halls  gardens public parks  libraries museums quiet centers places of joy and celebration places of
 tranquility and contemplation sites for
 the cultivation of a common citizenship in michael sandel 's lovely phrase an investment investment after all is just such a
  basic economic concept is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future 
 a shared present and a common future  and we need that relationship to reflect to reclaim
 hope 
 so let me come back with this sense of hope to the two billion people still trying to live each day on
  less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door  
 what can we offer those people it 's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty it
 's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations 
 and it 's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we 're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity
 in the richer nations a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth based model  so this is not just a western
  fantasy  in fact an african philosopher wrote to me 
 when prosperity without growth was published pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional african concept of ubuntu
 ubuntu says i am because we are prosperity is
 a shared endeavor its roots are long and deep its foundations i 've tried to show exist already inside each of us so this
 is not about standing in the way of development it 's not about
  not about trying to change human nature  what we 're doing here
 is we 're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose  
 and at the heart of that economics we 're placing a more credible more robust and more realistic vision
 of what it means to be
  to be inspiring so you may need to work on the tone a little 
 can you picture the politicians ever buying into this i mean can you picture a politician standing up in britain and saying
  gdp fell two percent this year good news we 're actually all happier  and a country 's more beautiful and our lives are better tim jackson well that 's clearly not what you 're doing you 're not making news out of things falling down you 're making 
  news out of the things that tell you that we 're flourishing can i picture politicians doing it actually 
  would stand up treasury spokesmen would stand up  and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves and actually in the period through which we 've been working over the last eighteen years partly because of the financial crisis
 and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world ca but is it mainly politicians who are going to have to
 get their act together or is it going to be more just just civil society and companies
  it has to be companies  it has to be civil society but it has to have political leadership this is a kind of agenda which
 actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma  because they 're hooked on the growth model themselves  but actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing different kinds of politics 
 and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently
 absolutely vital ca and if someone could convince you that we actually can make the what was
 130 fold improvement in
 efficiency of reduction of carbon footprint would you then actually like that picture of economic growth
 into more knowledge based goods tj 
 i would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use 
 and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water if you can convince me we can do all that then yes i would take the two percent ca tim 
 thank you for a very important talk thank you
