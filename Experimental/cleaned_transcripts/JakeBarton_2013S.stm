  thousands and thousands of americans back to work by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels  
 but he also did something interesting which was to hire a few hundred writers to scour america to capture the stories of ordinary americans charley williams a poor sharecropper  
 wouldn 't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview but charley had actually been a slave until he was twenty two years old
  and the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories of human lived
  anna deavere smith famously said that there 's a literature inside of each of us  
 and three generations later i was part of a project called storycorps  which set out to capture the stories of ordinary americans
 by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces  the idea is very very simple you go into these booths  you interview your grandmother or relative you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the library of congress it 's essentially a way to make a national oral
  archive one conversation at a time and the question is who do you want
 to remember if you had just forty five minutes with your grandmother 
 what 's interesting in conversations with the founder dave isay we always actually talked about this as a little bit of a subversive project because when you think about it it 's actually not really about the stories that are being told it 's about listening 
 and it 's about the questions that you get to ask questions that you may not have permission to on any other day
 i 'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project [ jesus melendez talking about poet pedro pietri 's final moments ] jesus melendez 
 we took off  and as we were ascending  
 before we had leveled off our level off point was forty five thousand feet  so before we had leveled off pedro began leaving us  and
 the beauty about it
  to remind you that as dumpy as i am it 's coming from me it 's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio  
  so this is the ring that my father gave to my mother and we can leave it there and he saved up and he purchased this and he proposed to my mother with this  and so i thought that i would give it to you
 so that he could be with us for this also  so i 'm going to share a mic with
  this is how your mother and i got married in a booth in grand central station with my father 's ring my grandfather was a cab driver for forty years he used to pick people up here every
  so i have to say i did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry the
 entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself  
 and that motion of building an institution out of a moment of conversation and listening is actually a lot of what my firm local projects is doing with our engagements in general so we 're a media design firm  and we 're working with a broad array of different institutions
 building media installations for museums and public
  spaces our latest engagement is the cleveland museum of art  which we 've created an engagement called gallery one for 
 and gallery one is an interesting project because it started with this massive $ three hundred and fifty million expansion for the cleveland museum of art  and we actually brought in this piece 
 specifically to grow new capacity new audiences at the same time that the museum itself is growing  glenn lowry the head of moma put it best when he said we want visitors to
  actually cease being visitors visitors are transient we want people who live here people who have ownership 
 and so what we 're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries so you can still have a traditional gallery experience  but if you 're interested you can actually 
 engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it 's from or manipulate the work itself 
  and this is where it originated from 
 or this individual piece here  you can see the actual bedroom it really changes the way you think about this type of a tempera painting 
 this is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself this is rodin 's bust you get the sense of this incredible factory for creativity and it makes you think about literally the hundreds or thousands of years of human creativity and how each individual artwork stands in for part of that story
 this is picasso of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century  
 and so our next interface which i 'll show you actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity it 's an algorithm
 that actually allows you to browse the actual museum 's collection using facial recognition so this person 's making different faces  and it 's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she 's looking
  and so you can imagine that as people are
 performing inside of the museum itself  you get this sense of this emotional connection this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years  
 this is an interface that actually allows you to draw and then draws forth objects using those same shapes  
 so more and more we 're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves to be creative even as they 're looking at other people
  's creativity and understanding them so in this
 wall the collections wall you can actually see all three thousand artworks all at the same time 
 and you can actually author your own individual walking tours of the museum so you can share them 
 and someone can take a tour with the museum director or a tour with their little cousin 
 but all the while that we 've been working on this engagement for cleveland we 've also been working in the background on really our largest engagement to date
  and that 's the nine eleven memorial and museum 
 so we started in two thousand and six as part of a team with thinc design to create the original master plan for the museum 
 and then we 've done all the media design both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production so the memorial opened in two thousand and eleven and the museum 's going to open next year in two thousand and
  and you can see from these images the site is so raw and almost archaeological and of course the event itself is so recent somewhere between history and current events it was a huge challenge 
  to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this an event like this to actually tell that story  
  so it 's estimated that a third of the world watched nine eleven live 
 and a third of the world heard about it within twenty four hours making it really by nature of when it happened this unprecedented moment of global awareness  
 and so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world through video through photos through written history and so people 's experiences on that day which was in fact this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this
  but that was coupled together with this oral histories booth really the simplest we 've ever made where you locate yourself on a map it 's in six languages  and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day  
 and when we started seeing the incredible images and stories that came forth from all around the world this is obviously part of the landing gear
 we really started to understand
 that there was this amazing symmetry between the event itself between the way that people were telling the stories of the event and how we ourselves needed to tell that story
 this image in particular really captured our attention at the time because it so much sums up that event this is a
 shot from the brooklyn battery tunnel there 's a firefighter
 that 's stuck actually in traffic and so the firefighters themselves are are running a mile and a half to the site itself with upwards of seventy pounds of gear on their back
 we got this amazing email that said while viewing the thousands of photos on the site i unexpectedly found a photo of my son  
 it was a shock emotionally yet a blessing to find this photo 
 and he was writing because he said i 'd like to personally thank the photographer for posting the photo 
 as it meant more than words can describe to me to have access to what is probably the last photo ever taken of my son 
 and it really made us recognize what this institution needed to be in order to actually tell that story
 can 't have
 just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that 
 when you have the witnesses to history who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself  
 and so we started imagining the museum along with the creative team at the museum and the curators thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors and so we created
  idea of an opening gallery called we remember and i 'll just play you part of a mockup of it but you get a sense of what it 's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history
  i got a call from my father voice fourteen the phone rang it woke me up my business partner told me to turn on the television voice fifteen so i switched on the television voice sixteen all channels in italy were displaying the same thing voice seventeen the twin towers voice eighteen the twin towers 
 and you move from there into that open cavernous space this is the so called slurry wall it 's the original excavated wall at the base of the world trade center that
 withstood the actual pressure from the hudson river for a full year after the event itself  and so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity
 of presence of that moment into the actual exhibition itself and we tell the stories
 of being inside the towers through that same audio collage so you 're hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building or making their way down the stairwells  and 
  as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people
 who literally excavated on top of the pile itself
  and so you can hear oral histories so people who were actually working the so called bucket brigades as you 're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment 
 and as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about nine eleven 
 we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about nine eleven
  and we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable the types of questions that nine eleven itself draws forth for all of us  and so these are questions like how can a democracy balance freedom and security 
 how could nine eleven
 have happened and how did the world change after nine eleven and so these oral histories which we 've actually been capturing
 capturing already for years 
 are then mixed together with interviews that we 're doing with people like donald rumsfeld bill clinton rudy giuliani and you mix together these different players and these different experiences these different reflection 
  points about nine eleven and suddenly the institution once again turns into a listening experience so i 'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone 's reflection on the event
  who were there that day who immediately went to help people known and unknown to them
 was something that would pull us through voice four all the outpouring of affection and emotion that came from our country was something really that will forever ever stay with
  still today i pray and think about those who lost their lives and those who gave their lives to help others  but i 'm also reminded of the fabric of this country  the love the compassion the strength  
 and i watched a nation come together
 in the middle of a terrible tragedy jb 
 and so as people make their way out of the museum  reflecting on the experience reflecting on their own
 they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself because they 've gone back up to grade  
 and we actually got involved in the memorial after we 'd done the museum for a few years the original designer of the memorial michael arad had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated almost random 
 really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself but it was a huge challenge
  the families for the foundation certainly for the first responders and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found
 to actually create not an order in terms of chronology or in terms of alphabetical but through what 's called meaningful adjacency so these are are groupings of the names themselves which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order
 and we along with jer thorp created an algorithm to take massive amounts of data to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves  so this is an image
  actual algorithm itself with the names scrambled for privacy but you can see that these blocks of color are actually the four different flights the two different towers  
 the first responders and you can actually see within that different floors and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections
 that were requested by the families themselves  and so when you go to the memorial  you can actually see the overarching organization inside
  of the individual pools themselves  you can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial and you can search for an individual name or in this case an 
  employer cantor fitzgerald and see the way in which all of those names those hundreds of names are actually organized onto the memorial itself  and use that to navigate the memorial 
 between the different names themselves  so suddenly what is this undifferentiated anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life  in this case 
 harry ramos who was the head trader at an investment bank
  who stopped to aid victor wald on the 55th floor of the south tower and ramos told wald according to witnesses i 'm not going to leave you
  and wald 's widow requested that they be listed next to each other 
 three generations ago we had to actually get people to go out and capture the stories for common people 
 today of course there 's an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations 
 and this is our hope that 's there 's poetry inside of each of our stories thank you very
