  a little bit of me playing my life  
 i might look successful and happy being in front of you today  
 but i once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair 
 the violin  which meant everything to me became a grave burden on me  
 although many people tried to comfort and encourage me  their words sounded like
  meaningless noise  
 when i was just about to give everything up after years of suffering  
 i started to rediscover the true power of music
  i
  in the midst of
 restored
 my soul 
 the comfort the music gave me was just indescribable and it was a real  eye opening experience for me too 
 and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure
 of becoming a successful violinist  
 do you feel like you are all alone
  hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart as it did for me
  i use my music to reach people 's hearts and have found there are no boundaries my audience
 is anyone who is here to listen  even those who are not
 familiar with classical music  
 i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center  but also hospitals  churches  prisons and restricted facilities
  with my last piece  i 'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun  exciting and that it can rock you 
 let me introduce you to my brand new project baroque in rock 
 which became a golden disc most recently it 's such an honor for
  i 'm enjoying my life as a happy musician i 'm earning a lot more recognition than i 've ever imagined  
 but it 's now your turn  
 changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world just play your life with all you have and share it with the world  i really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by
 you tedsters play your
