  i have one more reason for optimism climate change maybe you don 't believe it  but here is the fact 
 on december twelve  two thousand and fifteen 
  if you 've worked with governments you know how difficult that is
 unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable
 and improve the life of all of us
  but it is even
 more remarkable
 if you consider where we had been just a few years ago  two thousand and nine copenhagen who remembers copenhagen  
 well  after years of working toward a climate agreement 
 the same governments convened in copenhagen
  why did it fail miserably 
 for many different reasons  but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global north and the global south  
 so now six months after this failure  
 i was called in to assume the responsibility of the global climate change negotiations
  you can imagine the perfect moment to start this new job 
 the global mood on climate change was in the trash can no one believed
 that a global agreement could ever be possible in fact  neither did i if
 you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful ted audience i 'm going to divulge a secret that has been
  do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible and without engaging brain i heard me
 utter not in my lifetime well  you can imagine the faces of my press team
 who were horrified at this crazy costa rican woman who was their
  new boss  and i was horrified too now i wasn 't horrified at me because i 'm kind of used to myself i was actually horrified
 at the consequences of what i had just said at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have
 to live
  it was frankly a horrible moment for me  and i thought well no  hang on hang on impossible
 is not a fact  it 's an attitude it 's only an attitude and i decided right then and there
 that i was going to change my attitude and i was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change so
 i don 't know no
 just this thanks  i don 't know
 what you would do if you were told your job is to
 save the planet put that on the job description 
 and you have full responsibility  but you have absolutely no authority  because governments are sovereign in every decision that they
 well  
 i would really love to know what you would do on the first monday morning  but here 's what i did i panicked 
 and then i panicked again  because i realized i have no idea how we 're going to solve this problem  
 and then i realized i have no idea how we 're going to solve this problem  but i do know
 one thing we have got to change the tone of this conversation  
 because there is no way you can deliver victory without optimism  
 and here i
 use optimism as a very simple word but let 's understand it in its broader sense let 's understand it as courage hope
  trust solidarity the fundamental belief that we humans can come together
 and can help each other to better the fate of mankind 
 well you can imagine that i thought that without that there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of copenhagen and for six years i
 i have stubbornly  relentlessly injected optimism into the system  no matter
 what the questions from the press and i have gotten better at those
 and no matter what the evidence to the contrary and believe you me  there has been a lot
 of contrary evidence but relentless optimism into
  and pretty soon  we began to see changes happening
 in many areas  
 precipitated by thousands of people  including many of you here today  and i thank you 
 and this ted community will not be surprised if i tell you the first area
  we began to see that clean technologies in particular renewable energy technologies began to drop price and increase in capacity to the point where today we are already 
  building concentrated solar power plants that have the capacity to power entire cities to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility and intelligent
  buildings  and with this shift in technologies  we were able to begin to understand
 that there was a shift in the economic equation  
 because we were able to recognize that yes there are huge costs to climate change and yes there are compounded risks  but there also are economic advantages and intrinsic benefits
  dissemination of the clean technologies is going to bring us cleaner air 
 better health 
 better transportation more livable cities more energy security  more energy access to the developing world 
 in sum a better world than what we have now  
 and with that
  should have witnessed in fact part of you were the spread of ingenuity and excitement that went through  first through 
  governments the private sector  captains of industry insurance companies  investors  city leaders  faith communities  because they all 
  began to understand this actually can be in their interest this can actually improve their
  bottom line  
 and it wasn 't
 just
 the usual suspects 
 i have to tell you i had the ceo of a major 
 major oil and gas company come to me at the beginning of last year and say
 privately
  of course
 he did not know how he was going to change his company but he is going to change it because he 's interested in long term viability  
 well  now we have a shift
 in the economic equation  
 and with that with broader support from everyone it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is
  in their national interest  and when we asked countries to begin to identify
 how they could contribute
 to global efforts but based on their national interest  
 one hundred and eighty nine countries out of one hundred and ninety five one hundred and eighty nine countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans  
 based on their national interest
  concurrent with their priorities  consistent with their national sustainable development plans  
 well  once you protect the core interests
 of nations then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a
 common path 
 onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy 
 into a  decarbonized highly resilient economy  
 and the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments
 are insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate  but they are only the first step  and they will improve over time  and the
  measurement  reporting and verification of all of those efforts is legally binding  
 and the checkpoints that we 're going to have every five years to assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding  and the path itself 
 toward a  decarbonized and more resilient economy is legally binding  
  handful of countries who had undertaken very reduced
 emission reduction commitments that were completely insufficient
 and furthermore  largely perceived as a burden now what do we have now we have all countries of the world contributing
 with different intensities from different approaches in different sectors
  but all of them contributing to a common goal
 and along a path
 with environmental integrity  
 well  
 once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding then you see that governments were able to
  i look back
 over the past six years 
 first i remember the day the paris agreement was adopted
 i cannot tell you the euphoria in the room five thousand people jumping out of their seats  
 crying  clapping  screaming yelling torn between euphoria
 and still disbelief at what they had just seen  because so many people
 had worked for years
  and this was finally their reality  
 and it wasn 't just those who had participated directly a
 few weeks ago i was with a colleague who was trying to decide on a tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife natasha  
 and once he had finally decided
 what he was going to buy
  the jeweler said to him you know you 're very lucky that you 're buying this now  because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change 
 but the jeweler said have you heard the governments have just come to a decision 
 and tahiti
 could have a chance well  what a fantastic confirmation
 that perhaps perhaps here is hope here is a possible
 chance  
 i 'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do we 've only just started our work on climate change 
 and in fact  we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts over the next five years that are the urgent five years  
 but
 i do believe that we have come over the past six years
  years from the impossible
 to the now unstoppable  and how did we do that by injecting transformational
 optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global 
  needs  and that if we understand that we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously
  as i look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century
 food security  water security  home security  forced migration
 i see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet  
 but we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change
  we can understand that we have got
 to reinterpret the zero sum mentality  
 because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers and that your loss is my gain  
 well  now that we 're in a world in which we have reached
 planetary boundaries and that
  not just so interconnected but increasingly interdependent on each other your loss is no longer my gain we 're either
 all losers
 or we all can be winners  but we are going to have to decide between
 zero and sum we 're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all
 or living life as the sum of all of us we 've done it once we can do it again
