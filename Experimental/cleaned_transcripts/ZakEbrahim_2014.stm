  into a hotel in manhattan
 and assassinated rabbi meir kahane the leader of the jewish defense league nosair was initially found not guilty
  of the murder  but while serving time on lesser charges  
 he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen new york city landmarks including tunnels  synagogues and the united nations headquarters  
 thankfully those plans were foiled by an fbi informant  
 sadly 
  bombing of the world trade center was not nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot
 el sayyid nosair is my father  
 i was born in pittsburgh pennsylvania in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three to him an egyptian engineer  
 and a loving american mother and grade school teacher who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me 
 it wasn 't until i was seven years old that our family dynamic
  started to change 
 my father exposed me to a side of islam that few people including the majority of muslims get to see it
 's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another it doesn 't take long to realize that for the most part  we all want the same things out of life
  in every religion in every population you 'll find a small percentage of people
 who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do 
 a few months prior to his arrest he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends he and some friends
 had been going to a shooting range on long island for target practice  he told me i 'd be going with him the next morning
  we arrived at calverton shooting range which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the fbi 
 when it was my turn to shoot my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about thirty yards off 
 that day the last bullet i shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone 's surprise especially mine
  the entire target burst into flames 
 my uncle turned to the other men and in arabic said ibn abuh like father like son 
 they all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment  but it wasn 't until a few years later that i fully understood what they thought was so funny 
 they thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of
 those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with one thousand five hundred pounds of explosives into the  sub level parking lot of the world trade center 's north tower  
 causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over one thousand others  
 these were the men i looked up to these were the men i called ammu which means uncle
  by the time i turned nineteen  i had already moved twenty times in my life  
 and that instability during my childhood didn 't really provide an opportunity to make many friends  each time i would
 begin to feel comfortable around someone it was time to pack up and move to the next town being the perpetual new face in class i was frequently the target of
  i kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted but as it turns out being the quiet chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition 
 so for the most part i spent my time at home reading books and watching tv or playing video games 
 for those reasons my social skills were lacking to say the least  
 and growing up in a bigoted household i wasn 't prepared for the real world
  been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements like a person 's race or religion so what opened my eyes 
 one of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the two thousand presidential elections  
 through a college prep program  
 i was able to take part in the national youth convention in philadelphia 
 my particular group 's focus was on youth violence and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life
  this was a subject in which i felt particularly passionate 
 the members of our group came from many different walks of life  
 one day toward the end of the convention i found out that one of the kids i had befriended was jewish 
 now it had taken several days for this detail to come to light and i realized that
 there was no natural animosity between the two of us
  i had never had a jewish friend before  and frankly i felt a sense of pride
 in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life i had been led to believe was insurmountable 
 another major turning point came when i found a summer job at busch gardens an amusement park 
 there i was exposed
 people from all sorts of faiths and cultures  and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character 
 most of my life i 'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin  
 and by extension that all gay people were a negative influence 
 as chance would have it i had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there  and soon found that many were the kindest  
  least judgmental people i had ever met 
 being bullied as a kid
 created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others  and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind
 in any other way than how i would want to be treated  
 because of that feeling i was able to contrast the stereotypes i 'd been taught as a child
 with real life experience and interaction i don 't know what it 's like to be gay
  acquainted with being judged for something that 's beyond my control  
 then
 there was the daily show on a nightly basis jon stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry
 and helped me to realize that a person 's race religion or sexual orientation
 had nothing to do with the quality of one 's character
  he was
 in many ways a father figure to me when i was in desperate need of one  
 inspiration can often come from an unexpected place  
 and the fact that a jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me 
 one day i had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change
 and she said something to me
 that i will hold dear to my heart for as long as i live 
 she looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime and said i 'm
 tired of hating people 
 in that instant i realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you
  zak ebrahim is not my real name  
 i changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life  
 so why would i out myself and potentially put myself in danger 
 well that 's simple  i do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence
 may hear my story
  and realize that there is a better way 
 that although i had been subjected to this violent  intolerant ideology that i did not become fanaticized 
 instead i choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism 
 against the bigotry  
 i do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for the terrible
  pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives 
 for the victims of terrorism i will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father 's actions  
 and with that simple fact i stand here as proof that
 violence isn 't inherent in one 's religion or race  and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father
 i am not my father  thank you
