  today i 'm going to speak to you about the last thirty years of architectural history  
 that 's a lot to pack into eighteen minutes  it 's a complex topic  so we 're just going to dive right in at a complex place 
 new jersey because
 thirty years ago i 'm
 from jersey  and i was six  and i lived there in my parents ' house in a town called livingston  
 and this was my childhood bedroom 
 around the corner from my bedroom was the bathroom that i used to share with my sister  
 and in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room  
 and that 's where everyone would hang
  out and watch tv  
 so that every time that i walked from my bedroom to the bathroom  everyone would see me  and every time i took a shower and would come back in a towel 
 everyone would see me  
 and i looked like this 
 i was
 awkward insecure  
  and i hated it i hated that walk i hated that balcony i hated that room and i hated that house  
 and that 's architecture 
 done that feeling those emotions that i felt  that 's the power of architecture  
 because architecture is not about math and it 's not about zoning  it 's about those visceral emotional
 emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occupy  
 and it 's no surprise that we feel that way because according to the epa americans spend ninety percent of their time indoors 
  that 's ninety percent of our time surrounded by architecture  
  that makes us a little bit gullible and very very predictable  
 it means that when i show you a building like this i know what you think you think power and stability and democracy 
 and i know you think that because it 's based on a building that was build two thousand five hundred years ago by the greeks
  this is a trick  this is a trigger that architects use to get you to
 create an emotional connection to the forms
 that we build our buildings out of 
 it 's a predictable emotional connection and we 've been using this trick for a long long time  
 we used it [ two hundred ] years ago to build banks  we used it in the 19th century to build art museums  and in the 20th century in america  we used it to build houses 
 and look at these solid stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements
  this is really really useful 
 because building things is terrifying  it 's expensive  it takes a long time and it 's very complicated  
 and the people that build things developers and governments they 're naturally afraid of innovation and they 'd rather just use those forms that they know you 'll respond to 
 that 's how we end up with buildings like this
  this  
 this is a nice building  this is the livingston public library that was completed in two thousand and four in my hometown and you know 
 it 's got a dome and it 's got this round thing and columns  red brick  and you can kind of guess what livingston is trying to say with this building 
 children  
 property values and history  
 but it doesn 't have much to do with what a library actually
  does today  
 that same year in two thousand and four on the other side of the country  another library was completed  and it looks like this  
 it 's in seattle  
 this library
 is about how we consume media in a digital age  it 's about a new kind of public amenity for the city a place to gather and read and share
  so how is it possible
 that in the same year in the same country two buildings both called libraries  look so completely different 
 and the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum on the one side is innovation 
 and architects are constantly pushing pushing for new technologies new typologies new solutions
 for the way that we live today  and we push and we push and we push until until we completely alienate all of you we wear all black we get very depressed you think we 're adorable 
 we 're dead inside because we 've got no choice  we have to go to the other side and reengage those symbols that we know you love  
  experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we 've gone for the last three hundred years and certainly for the last thirty years  
 okay thirty years ago we were coming out of the ' 70s architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism it 's about concrete 
 you can guess this small windows  dehumanizing scale this
  is really tough stuff  so as we get closer to the ' 80s 
 we start to reengage those symbols we push the pendulum back into the other direction  we take these forms that we know you love and we update them we add neon
 and we add pastels and we
  new materials and you love it and we can 't give you enough of it  we take chippendale armoires and we turned those into skyscrapers 
 and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass 
 forms got big forms got bold and colorful  dwarves
 became columns swans grew to the size of buildings it was
  all hanging out in malls and we 're all moving to the suburbs  and out there 
 out in the suburbs we can create our own architectural fantasies  and those fantasies  they can be mediterranean or french
 or italian 
  possibly with endless breadsticks  this is the thing about postmodernism  this is the thing about symbols they 're easy they 're cheap  
 because instead of making places  we 're making memories of places  because i know and i know all of you know  
 this isn 't tuscany
  this is ohio 
 so architects get frustrated and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction in the late
 ' 90s we start experimenting with something called
 we throw out historical symbols we rely on new computer aided design techniques
  and we come up with new compositions forms crashing into forms  this is academic and heady stuff  it 's super
  we totally alienate you ordinarily the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction  and then something amazing happened in 
 this building opened  this is the guggenheim bilbao by frank gehry  
 and this building fundamentally changes the world 's relationship to architecture  
 paul goldberger said that bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics
  academics  and the general public were completely united around a building 
 the new york times called this building a miracle 
 tourism in bilbao increased two thousand five hundred percent after this building was completed  
 so all of a sudden  everybody wants one of these
  everybody wants one and gehry is everywhere  he is our very first
 now how is it possible
 that these forms they 're wild and radical how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout
  the world  
 and it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism 
 we created an emotional reaction to these forms so did every mayor in the world so every mayor knew
  that if they had these forms they had culture and tourism 
 this phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium happened to a few other starchitects it happened to zaha
 and it happened to libeskind  and what happened to these elite few architects at the turn of the new millennium could
 actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture as digital media starts to increase the speed with which we consume information
 because think about how you consume architecture  
 a thousand years ago you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building  transportation speeds up you can take a boat you can take a plane you can be a tourist 
 technology speeds up you can see it in a newspaper on tv until finally  we are all architectural
  and the building has become disembodied from the site architecture is everywhere now  
 and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture  
 because architecture actually moves quite quickly it doesn 't take long to think about a building  it takes a long time to build a building  three or four years  
 and in the interim an architect will design two
  or eight or a hundred other buildings
 before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not 
 that 's because there 's never been a good feedback loop in architecture  
 that 's how we end up with buildings like this brutalism wasn 't a two year movement 
  for twenty years  we were producing buildings like this because we had no idea how much you hated it it
 's never going to happen again 
 i think  because
 we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete of steel or of
  and it 's a media revolution 
 so my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum it starts swinging faster and faster until it 's at both 
 extremes nearly simultaneously  and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol between us the architects and you the public  
  emotionally charged symbols out of something that 's brand new 
 let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed
  we were hired to replace this building which burned down  
 this is the center of a town called the pines in fire island in new york state it 's a vacation community  
 we proposed a building that was
 audacious that was different
 than any of the forms that the community was used to
 and we were scared and our client was scared
 and the community was scared  so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto facebook
 and we put onto instagram 
 and we let people start to do what they do share it  comment like it hate it  
 but that meant that two years before the building was complete  it was
  already a part of the community  
 so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product 
 there were no surprises this building was already a part of this community  
 and then that first summer when people started arriving and sharing the building on
  the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media 
 because these these are not just pictures of a building they 're your pictures of a building  
 and as you use them to tell your story they become part of your personal narrative  and what you 're doing
 all of our collective memory
  and you 're making these charged symbols for us to understand 
 that means we don 't need the greeks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture  we can tell each other what we think about architecture  
 because digital media hasn 't just changed the relationship between all of us 
 it 's changed the relationship between us and buildings 
 think for a second about those librarians back in livingston if that building was going to be built today
  today the first thing they would do is go online and search new libraries they would be bombarded
 by examples of experimentation of innovation of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be 
 that 's ammunition 
 that 's ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor of livingston to the people of livingston and say there 's no one answer to what a
  library is today  let 's be a part of this 
 this abundance of experimentation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment
  everything is different now 
 architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings and you
  hapless public the consumer that won 't accept anything that they haven 't seen anymore 
 architects can hear you  and you 're not intimidated by architecture  
 that means that that pendulum swinging back and forth from style to style from movement to movement is irrelevant  
 we can actually move forward
 and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces  this is the end
 of architectural history  and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today  
 it means that
 a public space in the ancient city of seville can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works  
 it means that a stadium in brooklyn can be a stadium in brooklyn not some
  pastiche of what we think a stadium ought to be  
 it means that robots are going to build our buildings  because we 're finally ready for the forms that they 're going to produce  
 and it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature
 instead of the other way around it means that a parking garage in miami beach florida can also be a place for sports
  and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night it means
 that three architects can dream about swimming in the east river of new york  
 and then raise nearly half a million dollars from a community that gathered around their cause no one client anymore  
  that no building is too small for innovation like this little reindeer pavilion that 's as muscly and sinewy
 as the animals it 's designed to observe  
 and it means that a building doesn 't have to be beautiful to be lovable 
 like this ugly little building in spain where the architects dug a hole 
 packed it with hay  and then poured concrete around it and when the concrete
  they invited someone to come and clean that hay out
 so that all that 's left when it 's done
 is this hideous little room
 that 's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made 
 and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a spanish sunset 
 because it doesn 't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings it doesn 't matter how we build it matters what we build
 architects already know how to make buildings that are greener and smarter and friendlier we 've just been waiting for all of you to want them 
 and finally we 're not on opposite sides anymore  
 find an architect hire an architect work with us to design better buildings better
  and a better world  because the stakes are high buildings don 't just reflect our society they shape our society
 down to the smallest spaces the local libraries the homes where we raise our children  and the walk that they take from the bedroom
 to the bathroom  thank you
