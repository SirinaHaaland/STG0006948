  this is a recent comic strip from the los angeles times the punch line on the other hand i don 't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my labrador this
 is a recent cover of new york magazine
  best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment births strokes heart disease hip replacements
 four a m emergencies and this is a song medley i put together
  ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand it means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour a
 time for inconveniences  mishaps yearnings a time
 for plotting to whack the chief of police like in this classic scene
  coppola 's script describes these guys as exhausted in shirt sleeves it is four in the morning a
 time for even grimmer stuff than that like autopsies and embalmings in isabel allende 's the house of the spirits after the breathtaking green haired rosa is murdered 
 the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians ' paste they worked until four o 'clock in the morning  a time for even grimmer stuff than that like in last april 's new yorker magazine this short fiction piece by martin amis
 on september eleven two thousand and one he opened his eyes at four a m in portland maine and mohamed atta 's last day began for a time 
 that i find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press 
 i figured surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world really aren 't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented 
  it right could it be there is something more going on here something deliberate something secret and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway i say this guy alberto giacometti shown
  here with some of his sculptures on the swiss one hundred franc note he did it with this famous piece from the new york museum of modern art its title 
 the palace at four in the morning 
 not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning i can find i believe that this
  first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it i call this the giacometti code a ted exclusive no 
 feel free to follow along on your blackberries or your iphones if you 've got them it works a little something like this is a recent google search for four in the morning results vary of course this is pretty
  the top ten results yield you four hits for faron young 's song it 's four in the morning three hits for judi dench 's film four in the 
  morning one hit for wislawa szymborska 's poem four in the morning but what you may ask do a polish poet a british dame a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent google
  he shot himself in the head on december ninth which incidentally is judi dench 's birthday 
 but he didn 't die on dench 's birthday he languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly
  age of sixty four which incidentally is how old alberto giacometti was when he died where was wislawa szymborska during all this she has the world 's most 
 absolutely watertight alibi on that very day  december ten one thousand nine hundred and ninety six while mr four in the morning faron young was giving up the ghost in nashville tennessee
  four in the morning or one of them anyway wislawa szymborska
 was in stockholm sweden 
 accepting the nobel prize for literature 
 one hundred years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself coincidence no it 's creepy 
 coincidence to me has a much simpler metric that 's like me telling you hey you know the nobel prize was established in one thousand nine hundred and one which coincidentally
 is the same year alberto giacometti was born
  not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm but that does not mean there 's not something going on at the highest possible levels in fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we 're about
  let me see if i got this straight  matt 
 when homer simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock but the whole
  freaking calendar he comes up with four hundred on the birthday of the baby jesus and no  i don 't know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme 
  of things but obviously i know a coded message when i see one 
  here at ted parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want 
 or you can go to the random house website where there is this excerpt and how far down into it you figure we 'll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket would you believe
 about a dozen paragraphs this is page four hundred and seventy four on your paperbacks if you 're following along 
 though it was getting better i still wasn 't satisfied with the inaugural address 
 my speechwriters must have been
  tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on inauguration day i was still changing it sure you were  
 because you 've prepared your entire life for this historic
 quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you and then 
 three paragraphs later
  we get this little beauty 
 we went back to blair house to look at the speech for the last time it had gotten a lot better since four a m well how could it have by his own writing this man was either asleep 
 at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase what happens to american presidents at four hundred on inauguration day what happened to william jefferson
  we might not ever know and i noticed he 's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions 
 it could get awkward  right i mean after all this whole business happened on his watch but if he were here 
 he might remind us as he does in the wrap up to his fine autobiography that on this day bill clinton began a journey
 a journey that saw him go on to become the first democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades
 in generations the first
 since this man 
 franklin delano roosevelt who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election way back in a simpler time way back
