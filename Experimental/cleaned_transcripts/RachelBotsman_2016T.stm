  we all know trust is fundamental  but when it comes to trusting people something profound is happening
  please raise your hand if you have ever been a host or a guest on airbnb 
 wow that 's a lot of you who owns bitcoin  
 still a lot of you ok  and please raise your hand if you 've ever used tinder to help you find a mate 
 this one 's really hard to count because you 're kind of going like this 
 these are all examples of how technology is creating
 new mechanisms that are enabling us to trust unknown people  companies and ideas  and yet at the same time trust in institutions banks governments and even churches is collapsing  
 so what 's happening here  and who do you trust  
 let 's start in france with a platform with a company  i should say with a rather
 it 's a platform that matches drivers and passengers who want to share
 journeys together  the average ride taken is three hundred and twenty kilometers so it 's a good idea to choose your fellow travelers wisely 
 social profiles and reviews help people make a choice  you can see if someone 's a
  smoker you can see what kind of music they like you can see if they 're going to bring their dog along for the ride  
 but it turns out that the key social identifier
 is how much you 're going to talk in the car 
 bla not a lot  bla bla you want a nice bit of chitchat and bla bla bla you 're not going to stop talking the entire way from london to paris
 it 's remarkable right that this idea works at all because it 's counter to the lesson most of us were taught as a child never get in a car with a stranger  
 and yet blablacar transports more than four million people every single month 
 to put that in context
  that 's more passengers than the eurostar or jetblue airlines carry
 blablacar is a beautiful illustration of how technology is enabling millions of people across the world to take a trust leap 
 a trust leap happens when we take the risk to do something new or different to the way that we 've always done it 
 let 's try to visualize this together  ok  i want you to close your eyes
  man staring at me with his eyes wide open i 'm on this big red circle i can see so close your eyes i 'll do it
 with you and i want you to imagine there exists a gap between you and something unknown 
 that unknown can be someone you 've just met it can be a place you 've never been to it can be something you 've never tried before
  you got it  
 ok  you can open your eyes now  for you to leap from a place of certainty to take a chance on that someone or something unknown  you need 
 a force to pull you over the gap  and that remarkable force is trust 
  and yet we depend on it for our lives to function i trust my children
 when they say they 're going to turn the lights out at night i trusted the pilot who flew me here to keep me safe 
 it 's a word we use a lot  without always thinking about what it really means and how it works in different contexts of our lives 
 there are in fact hundreds of definitions of trust and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment
  of how likely it is that things will go right  
 but i don 't like this definition of trust because it makes trust sound rational and predictable  
 and it doesn 't really get to the human essence of what it enables us to do and how it empowers us to connect with other people  
 so i define trust a
  i define trust as a confident relationship to the unknown  
 now when you view trust through this lens it starts to explain why it has the unique capacity to enable us to cope with uncertainty to place our faith in strangers to keep moving forward 
 human beings are remarkable at taking trust leaps do you remember the first time you put your credit card details into a website
 that 's a trust leap  i distinctly remember telling my dad
 that i wanted to buy a navy blue secondhand peugeot on ebay  
 and he rightfully pointed out that the seller 's name was invisible wizard and that this probably was not such a good idea 
 so my work
  my research focuses on how technology is transforming the social glue of society trust between people 
 and it 's a fascinating area to study because there 's still so much we do not know for instance do men and women trust differently in digital environments  
 does the way we build trust face to face translate online  does trust transfer  so if
  you trust finding a mate on tinder are you more likely to trust finding a ride on blablacar 
 but from studying hundreds of networks and marketplaces there is a common pattern that people follow  
 and i call it climbing the trust stack let me use blablacar as an example to bring it to life 
 on the first level you have to trust the idea so you have to trust the idea of
  the second level is about having confidence in the platform that blablacar will help you if something goes wrong  
 and the third level is about using little bits of information to decide whether the other person is trustworthy 
 now the first time we climb the trust stack  it feels weird 
 even risky  but we get to a point where these ideas seem totally normal
  our behaviors transform often relatively quickly in other words trust enables change and innovation  
 so an idea that intrigued me and i 'd like you to consider is whether we can better understand major waves of disruption and change in individuals in society through the lens of trust  
 well it turns out that trust
  only evolved in three significant chapters throughout the course of human history local institutional and what we 're now entering distributed 
 so for a long time until the mid 1800s trust was built around   tight knit relationships so say i lived in a village with the first five rows of this audience 
 and we all knew one another
  say i wanted to borrow money
 the man who had his eyes wide open he might lend it to me and if i didn 't pay him back you 'd all know i was dodgy i would get a bad reputation and you would refuse to do business with me in the future 
 trust was mostly local and 
 in the mid 19th century society went through a tremendous amount of change people moved to
  such as london and san francisco and a local banker here was replaced
 by large corporations that didn 't know us as individuals 
 we started to place our trust into black box systems of authority  things like legal contracts and regulation and insurance  
  it 's widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands has been steadily declining and continues to do so 
 i am constantly stunned by major breaches of trust the news corp phone hacking  the
  emissions scandal 
 the widespread abuse in the catholic church  the fact that only one measly banker went to jail after the great financial crisis 
 or more recently the panama papers that revealed how the rich can exploit offshore tax regimes  and the thing that really surprises me is 
 why do leaders find it so hard to apologize  i mean sincerely apologize when our
  trust is broken  
 it would be easy to conclude that institutional trust isn 't working because we are fed up with the sheer audacity of dishonest elites  
 but what 's happening now runs deeper than the rampant questioning of the size and structure of institutions 
 we 're starting to realize that institutional trust wasn 't designed for the digital age
 conventions of how trust is built managed  lost and repaired in brands leaders and entire systems is being turned upside down 
 now this is exciting  but it 's frightening  because it forces many of us to have to rethink how trust is built and destroyed
 with our customers with our employees  even our loved ones
 the other day  i was talking to the ceo of a leading international hotel brand and as is often the case we got onto the topic of airbnb 
 and he admitted to me that he was perplexed by their success he was perplexed at how a company that depends on the willingness of strangers to trust one another could work so well across one hundred and
 ninety one countries  so i said to him that i had a confession to make and he looked at me a bit strangely  and i said
 and i 'm sure many of you do this as well i don 't always bother to hang my towels up when i 'm
 finished in the hotel  but i would never do this as a guest on airbnb and the reason why i would never do this as a guest
 on airbnb is because guests know that
  be rated by hosts  and that those ratings are likely to impact their ability to transact in the future  
 it 's a simple illustration of how online trust will change our behaviors in the real world 
 make us more accountable in ways we cannot yet even imagine
  i am not saying we do not need hotels or traditional forms of authority
 but what we cannot deny
 is that the way trust flows through society is changing  
 and it 's creating this big shift away from the 20th century that was defined by institutional trust towards the 21st century that will be fueled by distributed trust 
 trust
  it 's being unbundled and inverted it 's no longer opaque and linear a new recipe for trust is emerging
 that once again is distributed amongst people and 
 and this shift is only going to accelerate with the emergence of the blockchain  
 the innovative ledger technology underpinning bitcoin
  let 's be honest getting our heads around the way blockchain works is  mind blowing 
 and one of the reasons why is it involves processing some pretty complicated concepts with terrible names  i mean  cryptographic algorithms 
  and hash functions and people called miners who verify transactions all that was created by this mysterious
  person or persons called satoshi nakamoto  now that is a massive trust leap that hasn 't
 happened yet 
 but let 's try to imagine this so the economist eloquently described the blockchain as the great chain of being
  can describe it is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets 
 and they are filled with assets so that could be a property title  it could be a stock trade it could be a creative asset such as the rights to a song  
 every time something moves from one place on the register to somewhere else that asset transfer is
 on the blockchain  
 it 's that simple right  
 so the real implication of the blockchain is that it removes the need for any kind of third party such as a lawyer or a trusted intermediary 
 or maybe not a government intermediary to facilitate the exchange  so if we go back to the trust stack  you still have to trust the idea  you have to trust the platform
 have to trust the other person in the traditional sense  
 the implications are huge in the same way the internet blew open the doors to an age of information available to everyone the blockchain will revolutionize trust on a global scale  
 now i 've waited to the end intentionally to mention uber because i recognize that it
  contentious and widely overused example but in the context of a new era of trust it 's a great case study  
 now we will see cases of abuse of distributed trust we 've already seen this and it can go horribly wrong  
 i am not surprised that we are seeing protests from taxi associations all around the world trying to get governments to ban uber based on claims
 that it is unsafe 
 i happened to be in london the day that these protests took place and i happened to notice a tweet from matt hancock who is a british minister for business  
  and he wrote does anyone have details of this # uber app everyone 's talking about 
  heard of it until today 
 now  the taxi associations 
 they legitimized the first layer of the trust stack they legitimized the idea that they were trying to eliminate  and  sign ups increased by eight hundred and fifty percent
 in twenty four hours  now this is a really strong illustration of how once a trust shift has happened
  around a behavior
 or an entire sector  you cannot reverse the story  
 every day  five million people will take a trust leap and ride with uber in china on didi the ride sharing platform  eleven 
 million rides taken every day that 's one hundred and twenty seven rides per second showing that this is a cross cultural phenomenon  
  thing is that both drivers and passengers report that seeing a name
 and seeing someone 's photo and their rating makes them feel safer  
 and as you may have experienced even behave a little more nicely in the taxi cab 
 uber and didi are early but powerful examples of how technology is creating trust between people in ways and on a scale never possible before
 many of us are comfortable getting into cars driven by strangers 
 we meet up with someone we swiped right to be matched with 
 we share our homes with people we do not know this is just the beginning 
 because the real disruption happening isn 't
  it 's the trust shift it creates  
 and for my part  i want to help people understand this new era of trust
 so that we can get it right and we can embrace the opportunities to redesign systems that are more transparent  inclusive and accountable  thank you very much
