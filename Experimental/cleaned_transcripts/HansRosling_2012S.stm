  to talk about religion  but it 's a broad and very delicate
 subject  so i have to limit myself  and therefore i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality
 laughter this is a very serious talk  
 so i will talk of what i remember as the most wonderful  it 's when the young couple whisper tonight
 we are going to make a baby my talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies
 per woman  this is indeed important
  everyone understands that there is some sort of limit on how many people we can be on this planet  
 and there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this three billion in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven billion just last year and 
  it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies  and it may continue like this
  to what extent are these people right
 when i was born there was less than one billion children in the world  and today  two thousand there 's almost two billion 
 what has happened since  and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century  this is a
  what do you think do you think it will decrease to one billion will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century  will the number of children increase 
 each year up to fifteen years or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there i will tell you by the end of my speech
  when you want to classify religion it 's more difficult than you think you go to wikipedia and the first map you find is this it divides the world into abrahamic religions 
 and eastern religion  but that 's not detailed enough  so we went on and we looked in wikipedia we found this map  but that subdivides christianity 
  islam and buddhism into many subgroups which was too detailed therefore at gapminder we
  made our own map  and it looks like this
 each country 's a bubble  
 the size is the population big china big india here and the color now is the majority religion  
 it 's the religion where more than fifty percent of the people say that they belong it 's eastern religion in india and china and neighboring asian countries 
 islam is the
  majority religion all the way from the atlantic ocean across the middle east southern europe and through asia all the way to indonesia 
 that 's where we find islamic majority and christian majority religions 
 we see in these countries they are blue  and that is most countries in america and europe many countries in africa and a few in asia
  here are countries which cannot be classified because one religion does not reach fifty percent or there is doubt about the data or there 's some other reason so we were careful with that so 
  bear with our simplicity now when i take you over to this shot this is in one thousand nine hundred and sixty  and now i show the number of babies per woman here two
  or six
 many babies few babies  and here the income per person in comparable dollars the reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies  
 so low income here  high income there and indeed in one thousand nine hundred and sixty you had to be a rich christian to have few babies  
 the exception was japan 
 japan here was regarded as an exception  otherwise it was only christian countries
  christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman  but they were in latin america or they were in africa 
 and countries with
 islam as the majority religion all of them almost had six to seven children per woman  
 irregardless of the income level  and all the eastern religions except japan had the same level now let 's see what
  has happened in the world  i start the world and here we go now one thousand nine hundred and sixty two can you see they 're getting a little richer but the number of babies per woman is falling look at china they 
  're falling fairly fast and all of the muslim majority countries across the income are coming down as do the christian
  and when we enter into this century you 'll find more than half of mankind down here and by two thousand and ten we are actually eighty percent of humans 
  who live in countries with about two children per woman it
 's a quite amazing development which has happened 
  and all the way to bangladesh and vietnam which has less than five percent of the income per person of the united states and the same amount of babies per woman  
 i can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries we get
  that from the census data it 's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful  
 so what we can conclude is you don 't have to get rich to have few children it has happened across the world  
 and then when we look at at religions we can see that the eastern religions indeed there 's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than
  whereas with
 islam as a majority religion and christianity  you see countries all the way but there 's no major difference 
 there 's no major difference between these religions  
 there is a difference with income the countries which have many babies per woman here  they have quite low income most of them are in sub saharan africa  
 but
  are also countries here like guatemala like papua new guinea  like yemen and afghanistan 
 many think that afghanistan here and congo which have suffered severe conflicts that they don 't have fast population growth 
  it 's the other way around in the world today it 's the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth  because the death of a child is compensated by one more child
 these countries have six children per woman
  they have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman  but thirty years from now afghanistan will go from thirty million to sixty million congo will go from sixty to one hundred and twenty 
 that 's where we have the fast population growth  and many think that these countries
  are stagnant but they are not let me compare senegal a muslim dominated country with a christian dominated country ghana  i take them backwards here
 to their independence when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s just look what they have done it 's an amazing improvement from seven children per woman  they 've gone all the way down to between four and five it
  tremendous improvement so what does it take  well we know quite well what is needed in these countries  
 you need to have children to survive  you need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family  you need to have access to some family 
  planning and you need the fourth factor which perhaps is the most important factor  
  today  if i take these countries back to the years of their independence which is almost the same 
 it 's a quite amazing development which had happened look at bangladesh and qatar with so different incomes it 's almost the same drop in number of babies per woman  
 and what is the reason in qatar
  i do as i always do i went to the statistical authority of qatar to their webpage it 's a very good webpage i recommend it and i looked up
 oh yeah  you can have lots of fun here
 and provided free of charge i found qatar 's social trends very interesting lots to read  i found fertility at birth  and i looked at total fertility rate per
  these are the scholars and experts in the government agency in qatar and they say the most important factors are increased age at first marriage  increased educational level 
  of qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force i couldn 't agree more 
  is these four children should survive children shouldn 't be needed for work women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible  
 now look again at this  the average number of children in the world is like in colombia it 's two point four today  
 there are countries up here which are very poor and that 's where family planning better child
  i strongly recommend melinda gates ' last tedtalk  and
 here down there are many countries which are less than two children per woman  so when i go back now to give you the answer of the quiz  it 's two 
 we have reached peak child the number of children is not growing any longer in the world  we are still debating peak oil  but we have definitely reached peak
  and the world population will stop growing the united nations population division has said it will stop growing at ten billion  
 but why do they grow if the number of children doesn 't grow
 well i will show you here  i will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came they are quite useful for educational purposes  
 each card box is one billion
  are two billion children in the world  there are two billion
 young people between fifteen and thirty these are rounded numbers 
 then there is one billion between thirty and forty five 
 almost one between forty five and sixty  and then it 's my box this is me 60 plus 
 we are here on
  so what will happen now
 is what we call the big fill up 
 you can see that it 's like three billion missing here they are not missing because they 've died they were never born 
 because before one thousand nine hundred and eighty there were much fewer people born than there were during the last thirty years  
 so what will happen now is quite straightforward the old sadly
  we will die  
 the rest of you you will grow older and you will get two billion children 
 then the old will die  the rest will grow older and get two billion children  
 and then again the old will die
 and you will get two billion children 
 this is the great fill up it
  can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children religion
 has very little to do with the number of babies per woman
  all the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world
  access to some family planning
