  you may be wondering why a marine biologist from oceana would come here today to talk to you about world hunger i 'm here today because
 saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire it 's more than a thing we 're doing because we want to create jobs for fishermen or preserve fishermen 's
  jobs it 's more than an economic pursuit 
 saving the oceans can feed the world let me show you how 
 as you know there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet 
 we 're expecting that problem to get worse as world population grows to nine billion or ten billion by midcentury and we can expect to have greater pressure on our food resources  and this is a big
  concern especially considering where we are now 
 now we know that our arable land per capita is already on the decline in both developed and developing countries  
 we know that we 're headed for climate change which is going to change rainfall patterns 
 making some areas drier as you can see in orange and others wetter in blue  
 causing droughts in our breadbaskets in places like the midwest and central europe and floods
  in others it 's going to make it harder for the land to help us solve the hunger problem  and that 's why the oceans need to be their most abundant so that the oceans can provide us as much food as possible  
 and that 's something the oceans have been doing for us for a long time 
 as far back as we can go we 've seen an increase in the amount of food we 've been able to harvest from our oceans  it just seemed like it was continuing to increase until about
 hundred and eighty  when we started to see a decline 
 you 've heard of peak oil  maybe this is peak fish 
 i hope not i 'm going to come back to that but you can see about  an 18 percent decline in the amount of fish we 've gotten in our world catch since one thousand nine hundred and eighty  
 and this is a big problem it 's continuing this red line is continuing to
  but we know how to turn it around  
 and that 's what i 'm going to talk about today we know how to turn that curve back upwards  this doesn 't have to be peak fish if we do a few simple things in targeted places we can bring our fisheries back and use them to feed people 
 first we want to know where the fish are  so let 's look where the fish are it turns out the fish conveniently are located for the most part in our coastal areas of the countries in coastal zones and these are areas that national
  jurisdictions have control over and they can manage their fisheries in these coastal areas 
 coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions that go out about two hundred nautical miles in areas that are called exclusive economic zones  
 and this is a good thing that they can control their fisheries in these areas because the high seas which are the darker areas on this
  the high seas it 's a lot harder to control things because it has to be done internationally you get into international agreements and if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement you know this can be a very slow  
 frustrating tedious process and so controlling things nationally is a great thing to be able to do 
 how many fish are actually in these coastal areas compared to the high seas  
 well you can see here about seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing because we can
  actually get a lot done we can restore a lot of our fisheries
 if we focus in these coastal areas  but
 how many of these countries do we have to work in there 's something like eighty coastal countries do we have to fix fisheries management in all of those countries  
 so we asked ourselves how many countries do we need to focus on keeping in mind that the european union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy 
 so if we
  fisheries management in the european union and say  nine other countries 
 how much of our fisheries would we be covering turns out 
 european union plus nine countries covers about two thirds of the world 's fish catch if we took it up to twenty four countries plus the european union we would up to ninety percent almost all of the world 's fish catch  
 so we think we can work in a limited number of places to make the fisheries come
  back but what do we have to do in these places  
 well based on our work in the united states and elsewhere we know that there are three key things we have to do to bring fisheries back 
 and they are we need to set quotas or limits on how much we take 
 we need to reduce bycatch which is the accidental catching and killing of fish that we 're not targeting
  we need to protect habitats the nursery areas the spawning areas that these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully so that they can rebuild their populations if we do those three things we know the fisheries will come back 
 how do we know  we know because we 've seen it happening
 in a lot of different places this is a slide that shows the herring population in norway that was crashing since the
  was coming down and when norway set limits or quotas on its fishery what happens the fishery comes back 
 this is another example also happens to be from norway of the norwegian arctic cod  same deal the fishery is crashing they set limits on discards discards are these fish they weren 't targeting and they get thrown overboard wastefully  
 when they set the discard limit the fishery came back 
 and it 's not just in norway we 've seen this happening in countries all around the world time
  and time again when these countries step in and they put in sustainable fisheries management policies the fisheries which are always crashing it seems are starting to come back  
 so there 's a lot of promise here what does this mean for the world fish catch this means that if we take that fishery catch that 's on the decline and we could turn it upwards we could increase it
 up to one hundred million metric tons per year  so we didn 't have peak
  fish yet we still have an opportunity to not only bring the fish back but to actually get more fish that can feed more people than we currently are now  how many more right about now
 we can feed about four hundred and fifty million people a fish meal a day based on the current world fish catch which of course you know is going down so that number will go down over time if we don 't fix it but if we put fishery management practices like the ones i
  've described in place in ten to twenty five countries 
 we could bring that number up and feed as many as seven hundred million people a year a healthy fish meal 
 we should obviously do this just because it 's a good thing to to deal with the hunger problem  but it 's also cost effective it turns out
 fish is the most 
 protein on the planet if you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested
  compared to all of the other animal proteins 
 obviously fish is a good business decision it also doesn 't need a lot of land something that 's in short supply compared to other protein sources  
 and it doesn 't need a lot of fresh water it
 uses a lot less fresh water than for example cattle where you have to irrigate a field so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle  
 it also has a very low carbon
  footprint
 it has a little bit of a carbon footprint because we do have to get out and catch the fish it takes a little bit of fuel  but as you know agriculture can have a carbon footprint and fish has a much smaller one so it 's less polluting  
 it 's already a big part of our diet  
 but it can be a bigger part of our diet which is a good thing because we know that it 's healthy for us it can reduce
  our risks of cancer  heart disease and obesity in fact our ceo andy sharpless who is the originator of this concept actually he likes to say fish is the perfect protein 
 andy also talks about the fact that our ocean conservation movement really grew out of the land conservation movement and in land conservation we have this problem where biodiversity is at war with food
  you have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with and so there 's a constant push pull there there 's a constant tough decision that has to be made between
 two very important things 
 maintaining biodiversity and feeding people but in the oceans we don 't have that war in the oceans 
 biodiversity is not at war with abundance in fact 
 they 're aligned when we do things that produce biodiversity
  we actually get more abundance  and that 's important
 so that we can feed people now there 's a catch  didn 't anyone get that 
 illegal fishing illegal fishing undermines the type of sustainable fisheries management i 'm talking about it can be when you catch
 fish using gears that have
  when you fish in places where you 're not supposed to fish you catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species
  illegal fishing cheats the consumer and it also cheats honest fishermen and it needs to stop the way illegal fish get into our market is through seafood fraud you might have heard about this it 's when fish are labeled as something they 're not 
 think about the last time you had fish what were you eating are you sure that 's what it was because we tested
  hundred different fish samples and about a third of them were not what they were labeled to be snappers nine out of ten snappers were not snapper fifty nine percent of the tuna we tested
 was mislabeled and red snapper we tested one hundred and twenty samples and only seven of them were really red snapper so good luck finding a red snapper  
 seafood has a really complex supply chain and at every step in this supply chain there 's an opportunity
 for seafood fraud  unless we have traceability traceability is a way where the seafood industry can track the seafood from the boat to the plate to make sure that the consumer can then find out where their seafood came from 
 this is a really important thing it 's being done by some in the industry but not enough so we 're pushing a law in congress called the safe seafood act and i 'm very excited today to announce the release of a chef 's petition where four hundred and fifty chefs
  have signed a petition calling on congress to support the safe seafood act  it has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know anthony bourdain mario batali
 barton seaver and others and they 've signed it because they believe that people have a right to know about what they 're eating 
 fishermen like it too so there 's a good chance we can get the kind of support we need to get this bill through and it comes at a critical time because this is the way we stop
  seafood fraud this is the way we curb illegal fishing  and this is the way we make sure that quotas habitat protection and bycatch reductions can do the jobs they can do we know 
 that we can manage our fisheries sustainably we know that we can produce healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people
  we know that saving the oceans can feed the world  and we need to start now
