  i started working for a company called interval research which was just then being founded by david lidell and paul allen
 as a for profit research enterprise in silicon valley  
 i met with david to talk about what i might do in his company
  i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books
 after twenty years or so in the computer game industry
 having
 ideas that people didn 't think they could sell 
 and david and i discovered that we had a question in common that we really wanted the answer to and that was why hasn 't anybody built any computer games for little
  girls why is that 
 it can 't just be a giant sexist conspiracy these people aren 't that smart there 's six billion dollars on the table 
 they would go for it if they could figure out how so what is the deal here and as we thought about our our goals
 i should say that interval is really a humanistic institution in the classical
  sense that humanism at its best finds a way to combine 
 clear eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people 
 the basic idea of humanism is the improvable
 quality of life that we can do good things that there are things worth doing because they 're good things to do
 and that clear eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them 
 so  contrary to popular belief there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values 
 and interval research is kind of the living example of how that can be true so david and i decided to go find out through the best research we could muster 
 what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands
  hands on a computer to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games 
 we spent two and a half years conducting research we spent another year and a half in advance development  
 then we formed a spin off company  
 in the research phase of the of the project at interval we partnered with a company called cheskin research  and these
  people
 davis masten and christopher ireland changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be 
 they taught me how to look and see 
 and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child of all these things we already make you which do you like best 
 which gives you zero answers that are usable
  what we did for the first two and a half years was was four things 
 we did an extensive review of the literature in related fields like cognitive psychology spatial cognition gender studies play theory sociology primatology thank you frans 
  de waal wherever you are i love you and i 'd give anything to meet you 
 after we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing because after
  all that 's really what this is about we moved to the second phase of our work where we interviewed adult experts
 in academia some of the people who 'd produced the literature that we found relevant also we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day like playground supervisors we talked to them  
 confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions about gender difference and play 
 then we did what i consider to be the heart of the work
 one hundred children boys and girls ages seven to twelve all over the united states except for silicon valley boston and austin because we knew that their little families 
  would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn 't be a representative representative sample  
  we pulled together some survey data from another ten thousand children
  drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics for designing
  products and in fact any kind of products for little girls ages eight to twelve
  and we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls  
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six in november we formed the company purple moon which was a spinoff of interval research and our chief investors were interval research vulcan northwest
  institutional venture partners and allen and company  we launched a website on september 2nd that has now
  they visit an average of one and a half times a day  spend an average of thirty five minutes a visit and look at fifty pages a visit so we feel that we 've
 formed a successful online community with girls  we launched two titles in october rockett 's new school the first of a series of
  about a character called rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place with a blank slate which allows girls to play with
 the question of what will i be like when i 'm older what 's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school who are my friends to exercise the the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior 
 and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives
 and the ways that we conduct ourselves 
 the other title that we launched is called secret paths in the forest which addresses the more fantasy oriented inner lives of girls  
 these two titles both showed up in the top fifty entertainment titles in pc data entertainment titles in pc data
 in december  right up there with john madden football which
  several hundreds of thousands of little girls we 've made half a billion impressions with marketing and pr for this brand purple moon
 ninety six percent of them roughly have been positive four percent of them have been other 
 i want to talk about the other because the politics of this enterprise in a way have been the most fascinating part of it for me 
 there are really two kinds of negative
  reviews that we 've received one kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be and won 't show the product to little girls 
 the other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be  
 and so it 's funny to me that these interesting  odd bedfellows have one thing in common
 they don 't listen to little girls  
 they haven 't looked at children
 and they 're certainly not demonstrating any love for them 
 i 'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two and a half years of research that we did actually some of the voices are more recent 
 and these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care
  about these are pictures the girls themselves never saw but they gave to us
 this is the stuff those reviewers don 't know about and aren 't listening to and this is the kind of research i recommend to those who want to do humanistic work girl one yeah my character is usually a tomboy  hers is more into boys girl two uh 
 yeah girl one we have in the very beginning of the whole game always we
  very rich not rich
  you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy you would think that girls ' games were kinda sissy
 a vacation like when i get mondays and all those days
 off
  sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters or brother or sister when they copy you and you get your idea first and
  show you real quickly just a minute of rockett 's tricky decision which went gold two days ago let 's hope it 's really stable 
 this is the second day in rockett 's life the reason i 'm showing you this is i 'm hoping that the scene that i 'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar now that you 've listened to some girls ' voices 
  did you hear about nakilia 's big halloween party this weekend she asked me to make sure you knew about it nakilia invited reuben too but
 rockett but what isn 't he coming miko i don 't think so  i mean  i heard his band is playing at another party the same night
 max 's party is going to be so cool whitney he 's invited all the best people bl i 'm
 going to fast forward to the decision point because i know i don 't have a lot of time after this awful event occurs rocket gets to decide how she feels about it rockett who 'd want
 to show up at that party anyway  i could get invited to that party any day if i wanted to gee
 'll make max 's best people list bl ok
 so we 're going to emotionally navigate if we were playing the game that 's what we 'd do if at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters we can go into this hidden hallway 
 and i 'll quickly just show you the interface we can for example go find
 miko 's locker
 and get some more information about her oops i turned the wrong way but you get the
  idea of the product 
 i wanted to show you the ways innocuous as they seem in which we 're incorporating what we 've learned about girls their desires to
 experience greater emotional flexibility and to play around with
 the social complexity of their lives  i want to make the point that what we 're giving girls i think through this effort
 is a kind of validation a sense of being seen and a sense of the choices that are available in their lives  we love them  
 we see them we
 're not trying to tell them who they ought to be  but we 're really really happy about who they are it turns out they 're really great
  i want to close by showing you
 a videotape that 's a version of a future game
  in the rockett series
 that our graphic artists and design people put together that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers
