  planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities
 whose lights we can see twinkling but whose streets we can 't walk by studying those twinkling lights though  we can learn
 about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life
 in this image of the tokyo skyline i 've hidden data from the newest planet hunting space telescope on the block the kepler mission can you see it 
 there we go  
 this is just a tiny part of the sky the kepler stares at where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over one hundred and fifty thousand stars 
 all at once  every half hour and very precisely 
 and what we 're looking
 is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us 
 in just over two years of operations we 've found over one thousand two hundred potential new planetary systems around other stars 
 to give you some perspective 
  the previous two decades of searching we had only known about four hundred prior to kepler 
 when we see these little dips in the light 
 we can determine a number of things for one thing we can determine that there 's a planet there but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star 
 that distance is really important because it tells us
 how much light the planet receives overall and that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it 's a little like you or i sitting around a campfire
  you want to be close enough to the campfire so that you 're warm  but not so close that you 're too toasty and you get burned  
 however there 's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall and i 'll tell you why  
 this is our star this is our sun it 's shown here in visible light that 's the light that you can see with your own
  'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball that sun that we all draw when we 're children  
 but you 'll notice something else and that 's that the face of the sun has freckles 
 these freckles are called sunspots and they are just one of the manifestations of the sun 's magnetic field they also cause the light from the star to vary  
 and we can measure this very very precisely with kepler and trace their effects 
 however  these are just the tip of the iceberg
  we had uv eyes or x ray eyes 
 we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our sun 's magnetic activity the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well 
 just think even when it 's cloudy outside these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time 
 so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable whether it might be amenable to life
  to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is but we want to know about its space weather
 this  high energy radiation the uv and the x rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high energy radiation  
 and so we can 't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system i 'm showing here
 venus earth and mars three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size but only one of which is really a good place to live  
 but what we can do in the meantime
 is measure the light from our stars
 and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe 
 kepler won 't find a planet around
  every single star it looks at  but really every measurement it makes is precious 
 because it 's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets 
 and how it 's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe  
 while it 's kepler the telescope the instrument that stares it 's we life who are searching
