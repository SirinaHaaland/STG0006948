  there we were 
 souls and bodies packed into a texas church on the last night of our lives 
 packed into a room just like this but with creaky wooden pews draped in
 with an organ to my left and a choir at my back and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them a
 room like this nonetheless 
 with the same great feelings of suspense the same deep hopes for salvation the
 same sweat in the
  the night of the second coming of christ and the end of the world as i knew it 
 i had turned twelve that year and had reached the age of accountability
  and once i stopped complaining about how unfair it was that jesus would return as soon as i had to be accountable for all that i had done
 i figured i had better get my house in order very quickly  so i went to church as often as i could i listened
 for silence
 as anxiously as one might listen for noise trying to be sure that the lord hadn 't pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early  
 and just in case he did  i built a backup
  by reading the left behind books that were all the rage at the time 
 and i found in their pages that if i was not taken in the rapture at midnight i had another shot 
 all i had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast 
 fight off demons plagues and the antichrist himself it would be hard 
 but i knew i could do it but planning time was over now it was eleven
  we had ten minutes left and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying
 when midnight struck 
 so every faction of the congregation took its place the choir stayed in the choir stand the deacons and their wives or the baptist bourgeoisie as i like to call them 
 took first position in front of the altar you see in america
  the second coming of christ has a vip section 
 and right behind the baptist bourgeoisie were the elderly
 these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of east texas
 and whose skin seemed to be burnt a
  noble brown just like the clay of east texas  
 and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of east texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs yes these men
 and women
 were the stars of the show for me 
 they had waited their whole lives for this moment just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world 
 and just as my grandmother waited for the oprah winfrey show to come on
  eight every day at four o 'clock  and as she made her way to the altar i snuck right in behind her because i knew for sure
 that my grandmother was going to heaven  and i thought that if i held on to her hand
 during this prayer  i might go right on with her so i held on
 and i closed my eyes to listen
 to wait and the prayers got louder
 and the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still 
 and the organ rolled on in to add the dirge and the heat came on to add to the sweat 
 and my hand gripped firmer so i wouldn 't be the one left in the field my eyes clenched tighter so i wouldn 't see the wheat being separated from the
  it was over  i looked at the clock  it was after midnight  i looked at the elder believers
 whose savior had not come who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment who had believed too much and for too long
 to start doubting now  but i was upset
 on their behalf they had been duped  hoodwinked  bamboozled  and i had gone right along with them 
 i had prayed their prayers i had yielded not to temptation as best i could i had dipped my head not once but twice
  time to turn on the television and watch peter jennings announce the new millennium as it rolled in around the world it struck me
 that it would have been strange anyway 
 for jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones 
 and this made me feel even more ridiculous
  hurt really  
 but there on that night i did not stop believing  
 i just believed a new thing that it was possible not to believe it
 was possible the answers i had were wrong that the questions themselves were wrong and now  where there was once a mountain of certitude 
 there was running right down to its foundation
  a spring of doubt a spring that promised rivers  i can trace the whole drama
 of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me when the thing i believed most certainly
 turned out to be if not a lie then not quite the truth  and even though most of you prepared for y2k in a very different way
 convinced that you are here
 because some part of you has done the same thing that i have done
 since the dawn of this new century  since my mother left and my father stayed away and my lord refused to come 
 and i held out my hand reaching for something
 to believe in i held on when i arrived at yale at eighteen with the faith
  that my journey from oak cliff texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges i had known the broken dreams and broken bodies i had seen but
 when i found myself back home one winter break  with my face planted in the floor 
 my hands tied behind my back
 and a burglar 's gun pressed to my head i knew that even the best
  education couldn 't save me i held on
 when i showed up at lehman brothers as an intern in two thousand and eight 
 so hopeful 
 that i called home to inform my family that we 'd never be poor again
  i witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes i knew that even the best job couldn 't save me i held on
 when i showed up in washington dc as a young staffer  who had heard a voice call out from illinois saying it 's been a long time coming  
 but in this election  change has come to america 
 but as the congress ground to
  a halt and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke i knew
 that even the political second coming could not save me i had knelt faithfully
 at the altar of the american dream praying to the gods of my time
 of success  and money
  but over and over again midnight struck  and i opened my
 eyes to see that all of these gods were dead and from that graveyard i began the search once more not because i was brave but because i knew
 that i would either believe
 or i would die  so i took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca harvard business
  this time knowing that i could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer no i knew there 'd be more work to do 
 the work began in the dark corner
 of a crowded party  
 in the late night of an early miserable cambridge winter 
 when three friends and i asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time what if we took a road trip
 we didn 't know where 'd we go or how we 'd get there but we knew we had to do it 
 because all our lives we yearned as jack kerouac wrote to sneak out into the night
 and disappear somewhere and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country 
  so even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin we went on anyhow  
 we went on eight thousand miles across america
 in the summer of two thousand and thirteen 
 through the cow pastures of montana through the desolation of detroit through the swamps of new orleans where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose
  having been trained at the west point of capitalism this struck us as a revolutionary idea 
 and this idea spread growing into a nonprofit called mbas across america 
 a movement that landed me here on this stage today  
 it spread because we found a great hunger
 in our generation for purpose
  spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of america who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help  
 but if i 'm being honest it also spread because i fought to spread it 
 there was no length to which i would not go to preach this gospel to get more people
 to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country one social business at a time
  but it was this journey of evangelism
 that led me to the rather different gospel
 that i 've come to share with you today  it began one evening almost a year ago
 at the museum of natural history in new york city at a gala for alumni of harvard business school under a
  of a whale  i sat with the titans of our time
 as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds  there was pride in a room where net worth and
 assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars  we
 looked over all that we had made and it was good 
 but it just so happened
  two days later  i had to travel up the road to harlem where i
 found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot  
 listening to a man named tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day 
 all of them
 lived below the poverty line  many of them
 carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter
  some of them
 came to tony 's program called harlem grown to get the only meal they had each day 
 tony told me that he started
 harlem grown with money from his pension after twenty years as a cab driver  he told me that he didn 't give himself a
  because despite success the program struggled for resources he told me that he would take any help
 that he could get and i was there
 as that help  but as i left tony i felt the sting and salt of tears
 welling up in my eyes  i felt the weight of revelation
 that i could sit in one room on one night where a few hundred
  people
 had half a trillion dollars  and another room two days later  just fifty blocks up the road 
 where a man was going without a salary
 to get a child her only meal of the day  and it wasn 't the glaring inequality that made me want
  it wasn 't the thought of hungry homeless kids it wasn 't rage toward the one percent or pity toward the ninety nine no i was disturbed
 because i had finally realized
 that i was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant i realized that my story
 stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps
  even if they didn 't have any boots 
 that my organization stood in for all the structural systemic help that never went to harlem or appalachia or the lower 9th ward that my voice
 stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned too unwashed
 and the shame of that that
  peter jennings announce the new millennium
  tongues
 and saw suffering as a necessary act of god
 and took a text to be infallible truth yes i 've come so far that i 'm
 right back where i started 
 because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief no we believe today just as much as any time that came
  some of us may believe in the prophecy of bren brown or tony robbins  
 we may believe in the bible of the new yorker or the harvard business review  
 we may believe most deeply when we worship right here at the church of ted  
 but we desperately want to believe we need to believe 
 we speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems we see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god we take the text of
  progress to be infallible truth and we hardly realize the human price we pay
 when we fail to question one brick  because we fear it might shake our whole foundation  
 but if you are disturbed
 by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept then it must be questioning time
 so i have not a gospel
 of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line  i do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today in fact 
 i have and i offer
 a gospel of doubt  the gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing
  it asks that you believe a new thing that it is possible not to believe 
 it is possible the answers we have are wrong it is possible the questions themselves are wrong yes the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we 
 on this stage in this room are wrong  
 because it raises the question why with all the power that we hold in our hands why
 are people still suffering so bad
  this doubt leads me to share
 that we are putting my organization mbas across america out of business 
 we have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission 
 this doubt compels me
 to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me because our time
  too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings when the truth is that there will be no miracles here  
 and this doubt it fuels me  it gives me hope
 that when our troubles overwhelm us 
 when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds it will not
  be our blind faith no it will be our humble doubt
 that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world
 and lets us raise our voice to whisper or to shout or to say simply very simply there must be
