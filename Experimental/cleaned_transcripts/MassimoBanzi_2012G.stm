  few weeks ago a friend of mine gave this toy car to his 8 year old son  but instead of going into a store
 and buying one like we do normally he went to this website and he downloaded a file  and then he printed it on this printer
 so this idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines
 is something that the economist magazine defined as the third industrial revolution 
 actually  i argue that there is another revolution going on and it 's the one that has to do with open source hardware and the maker 's movement  because
 the printer that my friend used to print the toy
 is actually
  so you go to the same website you can download all the files that you need in order to make
 that printer  the construction files the hardware  the software all the instruction is there 
 and also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers and there 's a lot of innovation happening because it 's all
  don 't need anybody 's permission to create something great 
 and that space is like the personal computer in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six like the apples with the other companies are fighting and we will see in a few years there will be the apple of this kind of market come out well
 there 's also another
 interesting thing
 i said the electronics are open source because at the heart of this printer there is something i 'm really attached to these arduino boards the motherboard that sort of powers this printer 
 is a project i 've been working on for the past seven years it 's an open source project i worked with
 with these friends of mine that i have here so the five of us two americans two italians
 and a spaniard we you know  it 's a
  so we came together
 in this design institute called the interaction design institute ivrea  
 which was teaching interaction design this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object
 and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things 
 well when you design an object that 's supposed to interact with a human being if you make a foam model of a mobile phone  it doesn 't make any sense you have to have something that actually interacts
  worked on arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use so that our students could just build things that worked but they don 't have five years to become an electronics engineer we have one month 
 so how do i make something that even a kid can use and actually with arduino we have kids like sylvia that you see here that actually make projects with arduino
  kids stop me and show me stuff they built for arduino that 's
 really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them
 the tools  so let 's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly so one of the examples that i like to sort of kick off this
 discussion is is this example of this cat feeder  the gentleman who made this project had two cats one was sick and the other one was healthy
  so he had to make sure they ate the proper food so he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip
 mounted inside on the collar of the cat and opens the door and the cat can eat the food this is made by recycling an old cd player that you can get from an old computer some cardboard tape 
 couple of sensors a few blinking leds and then suddenly you have a tool you build something that you cannot find on the market
  like this phrase scratch your own itch if you have an idea you just go and you make it this is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics 
 so one of the features that i think is important about our work is that
 our hardware on top of being made with love in italy as you can see from the back of the circuit is that
 it 's open  so we publish all the design files
  for the circuit online  so you can download it
 and you can actually use it to make something or to modify to learn you know 
 when i was learning about programming i learned by looking at other people 's code or looking at other people 's circuits in magazines and this is
 a good way to learn by looking at other people 's work  so the different elements of the project are all open so the hardware is released with a creative commons license
  so you know i like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon like it was a song or a poem with creative commons 
 or the software is gpl so it 's open source as well  the documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the creative commons
  just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is arduino and what isn 't now
 arduino itself is made of a lot of different
 open source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a 12 year old kid  so arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open source technologies
 where we try to give them the best user experience to get something done quickly  so you have situations like this where
 some people in chile decided to make
  their own boards instead of buying them to organize a workshop and to save money 
 or there are companies that make their own variations of arduino that fit in a certain market  and there 's probably  maybe like a one hundred and fifty of them or something at the moment 
 this one is made
 by a company called adafruit  which is run by this woman called limor fried also known as ladyada who is one of the
  heroes of the open source hardware movement and the maker movement so this idea that you have a new sort of
 diy community that believes in open source in collaboration  collaborates online collaborates in different spaces 
 there is this magazine called make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community and you see a very technical project explained
  in a very simple language beautifully typeset  
 or you have websites like this one like instructables 
 where people actually teach each other about anything so this one is about arduino projects the page you see on the screen but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake
 and everything else so
 let 's look at some projects  so this one is a quadcopter  it 's a small model helicopter in a way it 's a toy
 and so this one was military technology a few years ago and now it 's open source easy to use you can buy it online  diy drones is the community they do this thing called arducopter  
 but then somebody actually launched this start up called matternet where they figured out that you could use this to actually
 transport things from one village to another in africa and the fact that this was easy to find open source easy to hack enabled them
  to prototype their company really quickly or other projects matt richardson i 'm getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on tv over and over and over again  so i decided to do something about it 
 this arduino project which i call the enough already will mute the tv anytime any of these
  our producers caught up with kim kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her mb eh mr it should do a
 pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of kim kardashian 's wedding mb 
 okay so you know  again what is interesting here is that matt found this module
  lets arduino process tv signals he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the tv put it together and then created this great project it
 's also used arduino 's used in serious places like you know the large hadron collider there 's some arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters  
  so this is a musical
 interface built by a student from italy
  and he 's now turning this into a product  because it was a student project becoming a product
 or it can be used to make an assistive device this is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds
  and writes the words that you 're signing on a display and again this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell 
  parts and you assemble it into a a project  or this is a project from the itp part of nyu where they met with this boy who has a severe disability cannot play with the ps3 so they built this device
 that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited
  or you can find it in arts projects so this is the txtbomber  so you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall 
 and it basically has all these solenoids pressing the buttons on spray cans  so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages
  module in the plant  and it 's measuring the well being of the plant and it 's creating a twitter account where you can actually
 interact with the plant so you know  this plant will start to say this is really hot or there 's a lot of
  baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks 
 or this is a 14 year old kid in chile who made a system that detects earthquakes and publishes on twitter he has two hundred and eighty thousand followers he 's fourteen and he anticipated a governmental project by one year 
 applause or
  another project where by analyzing the twitter feed of a family you can basically point where they are like in the harry potter movie  
 so you can find out everything about this project on on the website  
 or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts 
 it 's interesting how in two thousand and nine gizmodo basically defined said that this project actually gives a meaning to twitter so it
  so very serious project when the fukushima disaster happened 
 a bunch of people in japan they realized that the information that the government was giving wasn 't really open and really reliable so they built this geiger counter  plus arduino plus network 
  interface they made one hundred of them and gave them to people around japan  and essentially the data that they gathered gets published on this website called cosm another website they built 
  information from the field and you can get unbiased information  or this machine here it 's from the diy bio movement
 and it 's one of the steps that you need in order to process dna and again it 's completely open source from the ground up  
 or you have students in developing countries making
 replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make actually they just build
  them themselves for a lot less using arduino and a few parts this is a ph probe  
 or you get kids like these kids they 're from spain they learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably like eleven  and then they started to use arduino to make these robots that play football they became world champions by making an arduino based robot 
 and so when we had to make our own educational robot we just went to them and said you know you design it because you know
  exactly what is
 needed to make a great robot that excites kids not me i 'm an old guy what am i supposed to excite huh but as i
 in terms of educational assets there 's also companies like google that are using the technology
 to create interfaces between mobile phones tablets and the real world so the accessory development kit from google
  based on arduino as opposed to the one from apple which is
 sign your life to apple here you are there 's a giant maze and joey 's sitting there and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet 
 also i come from italy and the design is important in italy and yet very
  so we worked with a design studio called habits in milan to make this mirror which is completely open source this doubles also as an ipod
 speaker  so the idea is that the
 hardware  the software the design of the object the fabrication everything about this project is open source and you can make it yourself  
 so we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great
 devices to learn how to make interactive products by starting from something real  but when you have this
  idea  
 you know what happens to all these ideas there 's like thousands of ideas that i you know it would take seven hours for me to do all the presentations 
 i will not take all the seven hours  
 thank you but let 's start from this example so the group of people that started this company called pebble they prototyped a watch that
  via bluetooth with your phone and you can display information on it and they prototyped with an old lcd screen from a nokia mobile phone
 and an arduino and then when they had a final project they actually went to kickstarter and they were asking for one hundred thousand dollars
 to make a few of them to sell  they got ten million dollars  they got a completely fully funded start up and they don 't have
  get vcs involved or anything just excite the people with their great project  
 the last project i want to show you is this it 's called ardusat it 's currently on kickstarter so if you want to contribute  please do it  
 it 's a satellite that goes into space which is probably the least open source thing you can imagine  
 and it contains an arduino connected to a bunch of sensors so if you know how to use arduino you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite
 and run them so imagine  if you as a high
  school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite satellite space experiments
 like that 
 so as i said there 's lots of examples and i 'm going to stop here  and i just want to thank the arduino community for being the best  and just every day making lots of
  you told me earlier today that you had no idea of course that it would take off like this mb no ca i mean how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you 've unlocked 
  lot of people so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff and i just feel overwhelmed  it 's just it 's
 difficult to describe this every morning i wake up and i look at all the stuff that google alerts sends me 
 and it 's just amazing it 's just going into every field that you can imagine
