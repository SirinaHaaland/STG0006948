  take you on a voyage to some place so deep  so dark  so unexplored
 that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon  it 's a place of myth and legend
  it 's a place marked on ancient maps as here be monsters 
 it is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed 
 instead they just make me green with envy that my colleague from iucn was able to go on this journey to the south of madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep 
  a legal term but in fact it covers fifty percent of the planet with an average depth of the oceans of four thousand meters in fact the high seas
 covers and provides nearly ninety percent of the habitat for life on this earth 
 it is in theory  the global commons  belonging to us all  but in reality it is managed by and for
  those who have the resources to go out and exploit it so today i 'm going to take you on a voyage
 to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas
 in the dark we 're going to voyage to some of these special places that we 've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care  and then finally
  going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that 's rooted in
 conservation but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect  
 so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above that area in the darker blue
  to me as an international lawyer  this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen 
 for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean  the global ocean that provides us all with carbon storage with heat
 storage with oxygen if you can only protect thirty six percent this is indeed the true heart of the planet 
 some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws for example
 provide more protection to the areas closest to shore 
 for example  garbage discharge something you would think just simply goes away but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further 
  you are from shore as a result we have garbage patches the size
  to pollution was
 dilution but that has proved to be no longer the case  
 so what we have learned from social scientists and economists like elinor ostrom who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale is that there are certain prerequisites that you can
 put into place that enable you to manage and access open
 for the good of one and all 
 and these include a sense of shared responsibility common norms that bind people together as a community 
 conditional access you can invite people in but they have to be able to play by the rules  
 and of course if you want people to play by the rules you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement for as we 've discovered you can trust but you also need to verify
  what i 'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas  for a group of very dedicated individuals scientists conservationists photographers
 and states were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this
  that you see in front of you that is we 're able to save it from a fate of deep sea bottom trawling  
 and how did we do that well as i said we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process  
 but we also spent many hours in the basements of the united nations trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed  
 so within three
  years from two thousand and three to two thousand and six we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep sea bottom trawling  
 instead of go anywhere do anything you want we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you 're going and a duty to prevent significant harm 
 in two thousand and nine when the u n reviewed progress
  they discovered that almost one hundred million  square kilometers of seabed had been protected 
 this does not mean that it 's the final solution or that this even provides permanent protection  but what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape
 the way high seas are governed to create a new regime so i 'm looking optimistically at
  our opportunities for creating a true blue perspective
 for this beautiful planet 
 sylvia 's wish provides us with that leverage 
 that access to the heart of human beings you might say who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes  
 but are now hopefully going to become interested
  creatures like these sea turtles who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas  
 today we 're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain 
 the sargasso sea for example is not a sea bounded by coastlines but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this
 wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there
 's also known as the spawning ground
 for eels from northern european and northern american rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they 've actually stopped showing up in stockholm and five showed up in the u k just recently  
 but the sargasso sea the same way it aggregates sargassum weed actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region
 doesn 't exactly show the plastics that i would like it to show because i haven 't been out there myself but there has just been a study that was released
 in february that showed there are two hundred thousand pieces of plastic per 
 now floating in the surface of the sargasso sea 
 and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the sargasso sea for its protection
  its food 
 the sargasso sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat 
 it also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs  
 but what i 'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection 
 thus the government of bermuda has recognized
 the need and its responsibility as having some of the sargasso sea within its national jurisdiction but the vast majority is beyond to help spearhead a movement to achieve 
  protection for this vital area  spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now the ross sea in the southern ocean it 's actually a bay  it 's considered high seas because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims
  so anything in the water is treated as if it 's the high seas  but what makes the ross sea important is the vast sea of pack ice
 that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what till recently has been
 a virtually intact  near shore ecosystem but unfortunately
  regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of
 toothfish fisheries in the region  
 the captain of a new zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the ross sea
 killer whales who are directly dependent on the antarctic toothfish as their main source of food so
  what we need to do is to stand up boldly  singly and together to push governments to push regional fisheries management organizations to declare our right to 
  declare certain areas off limits to high seas fishing so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime 
  whales there 's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long  but what 's unusual about the costa rica dome is in fact it 's not a permanent place it 's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis 
 so in fact it 's not permanently in the high seas it 's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five central american countries  
 but it moves with the season as such it does create a challenge
  to protect  
 but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it we can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are in order to close 
  the area when it 's most vulnerable  which may in some cases be year round 
  many species are headed through this region which is why there 's been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern tropical pacific seascape this is the initiative that 's been coordinated by 
  conservation international with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area 
  the world heritage convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction at present 
 so a place like the costa rica dome could not technically qualify the time it 's in the high seas  
 so what we 've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the world heritage convention  so that it can
 adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites or we need to change the name and call it
 half the world heritage convention  
 but what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the eastern tropical pacific seascape these happen to go down to a vast south 
  pacific gyre where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this or as bycatch  
  we need to work locally but we also need to work
 we have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader
 initiative we 've heard about the tagging of pacific predators project one of the seventeen census of marine life projects it 's provided us data like this 
 of tiny little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean
  thousand kilometers in less than a year  
 so we have the tools and treasures coming from the census of marine life and its culminating year that 's going to be launched in october  so stay tuned for further information what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than
 the tagging of pacific predators it 's also looked in the really unexplored mid water column where creatures
  like this flying sea cucumber have been found 
 and fortunately we 've been able as iucn to team up with the census of marine life and many of the scientists working
 there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers we have the support of governments now behind us we 've been revealing this information through technical workshops and the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to
  we need more we need to move forward 
 but many of you have said  if you get these marine protected areas or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place how are you going to enforce it 
 which leads me to my second passion
 besides ocean science which is outer space technology i wanted to be an astronaut  so i 've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor earth from outer space and that we
  incredible tools like we 've been learning about in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their  life cycles in the open ocean we can also tag and track fishing vessels 
 many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they 're doing  
 but not all the vessels have those to date it does not take too much
 rocket science to actually try to create new laws
  mandate if you 're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources  we need to know someone needs to know where you are and what you 're doing  
 so it brings me to my main take home message which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons we can stop the collision course of fifty percent of the planet
  but we need to think broad scale we need to think globally we need to change how we actually go about managing these resources  we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect 
 at the same time we need to think locally  
 which is the joy and marvel of sylvia 's hope spot wish is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas 
 and to bring people to the table if you will to actually make them feel part of this community that
 truly has a stake in their future management and third is that we need to look at
 management our species are
 many of the deep sea communities have
 genetic distribution that goes ocean basin wide we need to better understand but we also need to start to manage and protect and in order to do that you also need
 that is we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone but we need to scale these up we need to build their capacity  so they 're like the southern ocean where they do have the two pronged fisheries and conservation organization 
 so with that i would just like to sincerely thank and honor sylvia earle for her wish for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national
  jurisdiction  it 's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to
 management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote  
 so on this tour i hope i provided you with a new perspective of the high seas  one that it is our home too 
 and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all
