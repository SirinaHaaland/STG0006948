  our ancestors looked up at the night sky and wondered what stars are wondering therefore
 how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen
 okay so most people only wondered that occasionally like today  in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them
  what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know they wished they knew
 how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing  and how they could rest when they were tired without
 risking starvation be warmer  cooler  safer  
  i bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know
 how to draw better  in every aspect of their lives
  they wished for progress just as we do but they failed 
 almost completely 
 to make any 
 they didn 't know how to discoveries like
  fire
 happened so rarely that from an individual 's point of view 
 the world never improved nothing new was learned
 the first clue to the origin of starlight
 happened as recently as
  physicists discovered the whole explanation  expressed as usual in elegant symbols  
 but never mind the symbols  think how many discoveries
 they represent  nuclei and nuclear reactions of course
  the conversion of mass to energy that 's e = mc ^ two gamma rays transmutation  
 that ancient dream that had always eluded
 the alchemists was achieved through these same theories
  that explained starlight
 and
 other ancient mysteries  and new  unexpected phenomena  that all that 
 discovered in forty years had not been in the previous hundred thousand was not for lack of thinking
 about stars and all those other urgent problems they had they even arrived
  at answers such as myths that dominated their lives  yet
 bore almost no resemblance to the truth  the tragedy of that protracted stagnation
 isn 't sufficiently recognized i think these were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did
  discover all those things  but that ability
 to make progress remained almost unused  until
 the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe  or so we should hope because that event was the scientific revolution ever since which our
  knowledge of the physical world and of how to adapt it to our wishes 
 has been growing relentlessly 
 now what had changed what were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between
 stagnation and rapid open ended discovery how to make that difference is surely the most important
  universal truth that it is possible to know  
 worryingly there is no consensus about what it is so i 'll tell you 
 but i 'll have to backtrack a little first 
 before the scientific revolution 
 they believed that everything important knowable was already known enshrined in ancient writings
  institutions  and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb which were however  
 entrenched as dogmas  along with many falsehoods  
 so they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little 
 and
 therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of
  learned men priests traditions and rulers which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context the enlightenment 
 a revolution in how
 people sought knowledge trying not to rely on
  take no one 's word for it but
 that can 't be what made the difference authorities had been rejected before many times and that rarely if ever caused anything like the scientific revolution 
 at the time what they thought distinguished science
  we 've seen that that can 't be true it did help by
 promoting observation and experiment but from the outset it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it 
 knowledge comes from the senses  in what language  certainly not the language of mathematics in which galileo rightly said  the book of nature is written
  look at the world you don 't see equations carved on to the mountainsides if you did it would be because people had carved them 
 by the way why don 't we do that what
 's wrong with us 
 empiricism is inadequate because well scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen
  the unseen  you have to admit doesn 't come to us through the senses we don 't see
 those nuclear reactions in stars we don 't see the origin of species  we don 't see
 the curvature of space time and other universes  but we know about those things 
  the classic empiricist answer
 is
 induction the unseen resembles the seen but it doesn 't you know what the clinching evidence was that
  is curved 
 it was a photograph not of space time but of an eclipse with a dot there rather than there and
 the evidence for evolution some rocks and some finches
  and parallel universes  again dots there rather than there on a screen what we see in all these cases  
 bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects
  so you admit it 's all interpretation no one has ever seen evolution we see
 rocks you have your interpretation we have ours yours comes from guesswork  ours from the bible but
 what creationist and empiricists both ignore
 is that in that sense  no one has ever seen a bible either that the eye only
  light  which we don 't perceive brains only detect nerve impulses  
 and they don 't perceive even those as what they really are  namely electrical crackles so
 we perceive nothing as what it really is our connection to reality is never just perception
  scientific knowledge isn 't derived from anything it 's like all knowledge it 's conjectural guesswork  
 tested by observation not derived from it 
 so were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates
 testability is common  in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking any crank claiming the sun will go out next tuesday has got a testable prediction  
 consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons  
  god of the underworld kidnaps persephone the goddess of spring and negotiates a forced marriage contract requiring her to return regularly and lets her go and each year  
 she is magically compelled to return and her mother demeter goddess of the earth 
 is sad  
 and makes it cold and barren
  is caused by demeter 's sadness  then it must happen everywhere on earth simultaneously 
 so if the ancient greeks had only known that australia is at its warmest when demeter is at her saddest 
 they 'd have known that their theory is false 
 so
 what was wrong with that
  that momentous difference i think
 there is one thing you have to care about and that implies
 testability the scientific method the enlightenment and everything and here is the crucial thing 
 there is such a thing as a defect in a story i don 't just mean a logical defect i mean a bad explanation what does that mean
  well explanation is an assertion about what 's there unseen  that accounts for what 's seen because
 the explanatory role of persephone 's marriage contract
 could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities  why a marriage contract and not any other reason for
 regular annual
  action here is one persephone wasn 't released she escaped  and returns every spring
 to take revenge on hades with her spring powers
  she cools his domain with spring air  venting heat up to the surface creating
  accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth it 's equally testable  yet what it asserts about reality
 is in many ways the opposite and that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons  except via the myth itself  
 this easy
  the sign of a bad explanation  because without a functional reason to prefer one of
 countless variants  
 advocating one of them in preference to the others is irrational 
 so for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress  seek
  the ones that can 't be easily varied while still explaining the phenomena now
 our current explanation of seasons
 is that the earth 's axis is tilted like that 
 so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year  and away for the other half 
 better put that up 
 that 's a good explanation  hard to vary
 because every detail plays a functional role for instance we know independently of seasons that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat
 are heated less and that a spinning sphere  in space points in a constant direction  and the tilt
 also explains the sun 's angle of elevation at different times of year and
  predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres if they 'd been observed in phase 
 the theory would have been refuted  but now  
 the fact that it 's also a good explanation  hard to vary makes the crucial difference 
 if the ancient greeks had found
 found out about
 seasons in australia they could have easily varied their myth to predict that 
 for instance when demeter is upset she banishes heat from her vicinity  into the other hemisphere where it makes summer  
 being proved wrong by observation and changing their theory accordingly still wouldn 't have got the ancient greeks one jot closer to understanding
  because their explanation was bad easy to vary  and it 's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it 's testable if the axis tilt
  theory had been refuted  its defenders would have had nowhere to go no easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres  
  the basic regulating principle of the enlightenment  so  in science two false approaches blight progress one is well known  untestable theories 
 but the more important one is explanationless theories whenever you 're told that some existing statistical trend will continue
  what causes that trend you 're being told a wizard did it
  hard to vary
