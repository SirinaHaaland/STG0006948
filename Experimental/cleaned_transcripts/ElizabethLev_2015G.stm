  imagine you 're in rome  and you 've made your way to the vatican museums  
 and you 've been shuffling down long corridors  past statues 
 frescoes  lots and lots of stuff you 're heading towards the sistine chapel  
 at last
  a long corridor  a stair and a door you 're at the threshold of the sistine chapel  so what are you expecting  
 soaring domes choirs of angels we don 't really have any of that there
  instead  you may ask yourself what do we have well curtains up on the
 sistine chapel and i mean literally you 're surrounded by painted curtains the original decoration of this chapel  
 churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses but as a way to represent the great theater of life 
 the human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story 
 a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the sistine chapel  
 now this building started out as
  a space for a small group of wealthy educated christian priests  
 they prayed there  they elected their pope there five hundred years ago it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave 
 so you may ask how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year 
  in that compressed space there was a creative explosion  
 ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history 
 now
 this development took place as a great evolution  moving from the beginning of a few elite and eventually able to speak to audiences
  of people that come from all over the world  
 this evolution took place in three stages each one linked to a historical circumstance  the first one was rather limited in scope it reflected the rather parochial perspective 
 the second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after columbus 's historical
  and the third when the age of discovery was well under way and the church rose to the challenge of going global  
 the original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world 
 there were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of jesus and moses reflecting the development of the jewish and christian people 
 the man who commissioned this pope
  men like sandro botticelli
 and the man who would become michelangelo 's future painting teacher ghirlandaio 
 these men they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color  
 and in these stories you 'll notice familiar landscapes the artists using roman monuments or a tuscan landscape to render a faraway story something much more familiar 
 with the addition of images
  of the pope 's friends and family  this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the european continent  but in 
 the new world was discovered horizons were expanding and this little one hundred and thirty three by  46 foot microcosm had to expand as well 
 and it did 
 thanks to a creative genius a visionary
  and an awesome story 
 now the creative genius was michelangelo buonarroti thirty three years old when he was tapped to decorate twelve thousand square feet of ceiling 
 and the deck was stacked against him he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture 
 there were angry patrons in florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions lured to rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project  
 and that project had fallen through
 and he had been left with a commission to paint twelve apostles against a decorative background in the sistine chapel ceiling which would look like every other ceiling in italy  
 but genius rose to the challenge in an age when a man dared to sail across the atlantic ocean michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters 
  would tell a story no apostles but a story of great beginnings the story of genesis 
 not really an easy sell stories on a ceiling  
 how would you be able to read a busy scene from sixty two feet below the painting technique that had been handed on for two hundred years in florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative  
 but michelangelo wasn 't really a painter
  and so he played to his strengths 
 instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within michelangelo was 
 he would tell his story in massive dynamic bodies  this plan was embraced by the larger than life pope julius ii 
 a man who was unafraid of michelangelo 's brazen genius he was nephew to pope
  had been steeped in art for thirty years and he knew its power  
 and history has handed down the moniker of the warrior pope but this man 's legacy to the vatican it wasn 't fortresses and artillery it was art  
 he left us the raphael rooms the sistine chapel he left st peter 's basilica as well as
 an extraordinary collection
  that would become the seedbed of the world 's first modern museum the vatican museums  
 julius was a man who envisioned a vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty  and he was right the encounter between these two giants michelangelo and julius ii that 's
 what gave us the sistine chapel  
 michelangelo was so committed to this project that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years using a skeleton crew
 and spending most of the time  hours on end reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling  
 so let 's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global  no more familiar artistic references to the world around you there 's just space
  and structure and energy a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels 
 more driven by sculptural form than painterly color  
 and we stand in the far end by the entrance far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer
  into the distance looking for a beginning 
 and whether in scientific inquiry or in or in biblical tradition we think in terms of a primal spark michelangelo gave us an initial energy when 
  he gave us the separation of light and dark  a churning figure blurry in the distance compressed into a tight space 
  sun  the moon  vegetation 
 michelangelo didn 't focus on the stuff that was being created  unlike all the other artists he focused on the act of creation  
 and then the movement stops 
  in poetry and the creator hovers so what 's he doing is he creating land is he creating sea or is he looking back over
  his handiwork the universe and his treasures just like michelangelo must have looking back over his work in the ceiling
 and proclaiming it is good 
 so now the scene is set  and you get to the culmination of creation which is man 
 adam leaps to the eye  a light figure against a dark background 
 but looking closer that leg is pretty languid on the ground
  arm is heavy on the knee 
 adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness 
 that spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger which is one millimeter from the hand of adam it puts us at the edge of our seats because we 're one moment from that contact
  through which that man will discover his purpose leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation  and then michelangelo threw a curveball 
 who is in that other arm 
 eve  first woman no she 's not an afterthought she 's part of the plan she 's always been in his mind look at her so intimate with god that her hand curls around his arm 
 and for me an american art historian from the
  was the moment that the painting spoke to me  because i realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women so much so 
 that the dead center the heart of the ceiling is the creation of woman not adam 
 you are at critical juncture now in the ceiling  you are exactly at the point where you and i can go no further into the church the gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum  
 and we are cast out much like adam and eve  the remaining scenes in the ceiling they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us you have noah and his ark and the flood you have noah he 's making a sacrifice and a covenant with god maybe he 's
  savior  
 oh but no  noah is the one who grew grapes invented wine got drunk and passed out naked in his barn  
 it is a curious way to design the ceiling now starting out with god creating life ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn
 and so compared with adam you might think michelangelo is making fun of us  
 but he 's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath noah
 emerald topaz scarlet on the prophet 
  zechariah foresees a light coming from the east and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade  you 
  have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way and we follow the mothers and fathers  
  they are the motors of this great human engine driving it forward and now we 're at the keystone of the ceiling  
 the culmination of the whole thing with a figure that looks like he 's about to fall out of his space into our space encroaching our space  this is the most important juncture 
 past meets present this figure jonah who spent three days in the belly of the whale for the christians is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through jesus ' sacrifice but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum
  from all faiths who visit there every day  he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality 
 all of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall where we see michelangelo 's last judgment painted in one thousand five hundred and thirty four after the world had
  the reformation had splintered the church the ottoman empire had made islam a household word and magellan had found a route into the pacific ocean how is a 
 artist who has never been any further than venice
 going to speak to this new world michelangelo chose to paint destiny 
 that universal desire  common to all of us to leave a legacy
  told in terms of the christian vision of the last judgment the end of the world michelangelo gave you a series of figures
 who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies 
 they have no more covers  no more portraits except for a couple it 's a composition only out of bodies three hundred and ninety one no two alike  unique like each and every one of us 
 they start in the lower corner breaking away from the ground  struggling and trying
  to rise 
 those who have risen reach back to help others and in one amazing vignette you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world  
 the lion 's share of the space goes to the winner 's circle there you find men and women completely nude
  they are the ones who have overcome adversity and michelangelo 's vision of people who combat adversity  
 overcome obstacles they 're just like athletes so you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight 
 presiding over this assembly is jesus  first a suffering man on the cross now a glorious ruler in heaven  and as michelangelo proved in his painting hardship setbacks and obstacles they don
  limit excellence  they forge it 
 now  this does lead us to one odd thing
  this is the pope 's private chapel and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes  but michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language the most universal artistic language he could think of that of the human body  
 and so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude
  he borrowed from julius ii 's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength
 as external power  
 now 
 one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to to not cause controversy  and so it did 
 michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press complaints about the nudity spread all over the place and
  soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography at which point he added two more portraits one of the man who criticized him a papal courtier 
 and the other one of himself as a dried up husk no athlete 
 in the hands of a long suffering martyr the year he died he saw several of these figures covered over a triumph for trivial distractions
 over his great exhortation to glory
  and so now we stand in the here and now we are caught in that space between beginnings and endings 
 in the great huge totality of the human experience the sistine chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror who am i in this picture am i one of the crowd am i the drunk
  am i the athlete  and as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty we are inspired to ask ourselves life 's biggest questions who am i 
 and what role do i play in this great theater of life  thank you
 in the eyes of the time  but actually the story is bigger it 's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures 
 this work of art was almost destroyed because of that
 elizabeth lev the effect of the last judgment was enormous the printing press made sure that everybody saw it and so this wasn 't something that happened within a couple of weeks  it was something that happened over the space of twenty years of editorials
  and complaints saying to the church you can 't possibly tell us how to live our lives did you notice you have pornography in the pope 's chapel 
 and so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed it was finally the year that michelangelo died that the church finally found a compromise a way to save 
  the painting and that was in putting up these extra thirty covers and that happens to be the origin of
 fig leafing that 's where it all came about and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art not indeed deface or destroyed it bg this 
 what you just gave us is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to
 the sistine chapel
  art today
 is encountering problems too many people want to see this there  and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just 
 think it 's really nice to be able to pause and look but also realize even when you 're in those days 
  thousand people a day even those days when you 're in there with all those other people look around you and think how amazing it is
 that some painted plaster from five hundred years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you looking upwards with their jaws dropped it 's a great statement 
 about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space
