  we live in an incredibly busy world  the pace of life is often frantic our minds are always busy and we 're always doing something 
 so with that in mind i 'd like you just to take a moment to think when did you last take any time to do nothing 
 just ten minutes
 undisturbed  and when i say nothing i do mean nothing so that 's no emailing texting no internet no tv no chatting no eating no reading 
 not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future  simply doing
 nothing  i see a lot of very blank faces
  probably have to go a long way back and this is an extraordinary thing right we 're talking about our mind 
 the mind our most valuable and precious resource through which we experience every single moment of our life  
 the mind that we rely upon to be happy 
 content  emotionally stable as individuals and at the same time to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others 
 this is the same mind that we depend upon to be
 focused creative  spontaneous and to perform at our very best in everything that we do 
 and yet we don 't take any time out to look after it in
 fact we spend more time looking after
 our cars our clothes and our hair than we okay maybe not our hair but
 you see where i 'm going  the result of course is that we get stressed  you know the mind whizzes away like a
  washing machine going round and round lots of difficult confusing emotions  and we don 't really know how to deal with that and
 the sad fact is that we
 are so distracted that we 're no longer present in the world in which we live we miss out on the things that are most important
  the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes that 's the way life is so we 've just kind of got to get on with it
 that 's really not how it has to be so
 i was about eleven when i went along to my first meditation class 
 and trust me it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine the sitting  cross legged on the floor  
 the incense  the herbal tea the vegetarians the whole deal  but
 my mom was going and i was intrigued so i went along with her i 'd also seen a few kung fu movies and secretly i kind of thought i might be
  to learn how to fly but i was very young at the time  now
 as i was there  i guess like a lot of people i assumed that
 it was just an aspirin for the mind you get stressed you do some meditation i hadn 't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature 
 until i was about twenty when a number of things happened in my
  life in quite quick succession 
 really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden i was inundated with thoughts 
 inundated with difficult emotions that i didn 't know how to cope with every time i sort of pushed one down another one would pop back up again it was a really very stressful time 
 i guess we all deal with
 stress in different ways  some people will bury themselves in work grateful for the the distraction others will turn to their friends their family
  for support  some people hit the bottle start taking medication 
 my own way of dealing with it was to become a monk  
 so i quit my degree  i headed off to the himalayas i became a monk and i started studying meditation 
 people often ask me what i learned from that time  well  
  's face it  becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things but
 it was more than that it taught me it gave me a greater appreciation an understanding
 for the present moment by that i mean not being
 lost in thought not being distracted not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions  but
  instead learning how to be
 in the here and now how to be mindful how to be present 
 i think the present moment is so underrated it sounds so ordinary  and yet we spend so little time
 in the present moment that it 's anything
 but ordinary there was a research paper that came out of harvard just recently that said on average our minds are lost in thought almost
  this sort of constant mind wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness now
 we 're not here for that long anyway  but to spend almost half of our life
 lost in thought
 and potentially quite unhappy i don 't know it just kind of seems tragic actually especially when there 's something we can do about it  when there 's a
 positive practical
  achievable scientifically proven technique
 which allows our mind to be more healthy to be more mindful and less distracted  and the beauty of it is that even though
 it need only take about ten minutes a day it impacts our entire life  
 but we need to know how to do it we need an exercise we need a framework
 to learn how to be more mindful that 's essentially
  what meditation is it 's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment but we also need to know how to approach it
 in the right way to get the best from it and that 's what these are for in case you 've been wondering because
 most people assume
 that meditation is all about stopping thoughts  getting rid of emotions somehow controlling the mind but actually
  's quite different from that it
 's more about stepping back 
 sort of seeing the thought clearly  witnessing it coming and going emotions coming and going without judgment 
 but with a relaxed focused mind  
 so for example right now if i focus too much on the balls then there 's no way i can relax and talk to you at the same time equally if i relax too much talking to
  there 's no way i can focus on the balls i 'm going to drop them 
 now in life  and in meditation there 'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense and life starts to
 feel a
 bit like this it 's a very uncomfortable way to live life when you get this tight and stressed 
 at other times we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much and things just become a sort of little bit like this of course in meditation
  end up falling asleep  so we 're looking for a balance a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go
 without all the usual involvement now what usually happens when we 're learning to be mindful is that we get distracted
 by a thought let 's say this is an anxious thought everything 's going fine and we see the anxious thought oh i didn 't realize i was worried about that 
  this is crazy we do this all the time even on an everyday level if you think about
 the last time you had a wobbly tooth  you know it 's wobbly and you know that it hurts  but what do you
  and we reinforce the storyline  right and we just keep telling ourselves  and we do it all the time and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go
 of those storylines and patterns of mind  
 but when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way  you might see many different patterns you might find a mind that 's really restless and the whole time
  don 't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated
 in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that 
 you might find a mind that 's very dull and boring and it 's just almost mechanical it just seems it 's as if you  're getting up going to work  eat  sleep get up 
 or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round
  offers
 the opportunity the potential to step back and to get a different perspective to see that things aren 't always
 as they appear  we can 't change
 every little thing that happens to us in life  
 but we can change the way that we experience it that 's the potential of meditation of mindfulness
  don 't have to burn any incense  and you definitely don 't have to sit on the floor all you need to do is to take ten minutes out a day
 to step back to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus 
 calm and clarity in your life
 thank you very much
