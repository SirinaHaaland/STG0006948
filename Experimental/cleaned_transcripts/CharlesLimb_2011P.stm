  we don 't usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved from a biological perspective  we don 't really think of
 the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses  but that 's probably why our senses really evolved to keep us safe to allow us
  to live 
 really when we think of our senses or when we think of the loss of the sense we
 really think about something more like this the ability to touch something luxurious to taste something delicious to smell something fragrant to see something beautiful 
 this is what we want out of our senses we want beauty  we don 't just want function  and when it comes to sensory restoration 
 we 're still very far away from being able to provide beauty
 to you a little bit about today  
 likewise for hearing when we think about why we hear  we don 't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren although clearly that 's an important thing 
 really what we want to hear is music
  so many of you know that that 's beethoven 's seventh symphony many of you know that he was deaf  or near profoundly deaf when he wrote that  now
 i 'd like to impress upon you how unusual it is that we can hear music music is just one of the strangest things that there is it 's
 acoustic vibrations in the air little waves of energy in the air that tickle our
 somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains
 as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music that process is entirely abstract and very very unusual 
 we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out how is it that we hear something that 's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air 
 turns out that if you have hearing loss most people that lose their hearing lose it
 at what 's called the cochlea the inner ear  and it 's at the hair cell level that they do this  now
 if you had to pick a sense to lose i have to be very honest with you and say we 're better at restoring
  we are at restoring any sense that there is in fact nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing  and as a physician and a surgeon i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing  
 as a musician  i can tell you that if i had to have a cochlear implant  i 'd be heartbroken  
 i 'd just be plainly heartbroken because i know that music would never sound the same to me 
  this is a video that i 'm going to show you of a girl who 's born deaf  she 's in a very supportive environment her mother 's doing everything she can okay play that video please
  now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning 
 there is a limitation to what a child who 's deaf an infant who was born deaf has in this world in terms of social  educational vocational opportunities  i 'm not saying that they can
  live a beautiful wonderful life  i 'm saying that they 're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 
  two hundred years i mean literally they used to do things like stick  ear shaped objects onto your ears
  you couldn 't even look at the eardrum so it 's not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss and now today we have the modern  multi channel cochlear implant  which is an outpatient procedure it 's surgically placed 
  inside the inner ear it takes about an hour and a half to two hours depending on where it 's done  under general anesthesia  and in the end you achieve something like this where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea  now actually this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear  but
  is that same girl who is implanted now this is her ten years later  and this is a video that was
 taken by my surgical mentor dr john niparko who implanted her if we could play this video please
  deaf do you remember writing that chapter
  and so she 's phenomenal  and there 's no way that you can 't look at that as an overwhelming success it is it 's a huge success story in modern medicine  
 however despite this incredible facility that some
  cochlear implant users display with language  you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can 't hear music almost at all in fact most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so 
  bad  and so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody 's life  we have a long way to go when it comes to audition 
  fact the whole reason we use it is because it has  semantic specificity 
 when you say a word what you care is that that word was perceived correctly  you don 't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken 
 music is entirely different when you hear music  if it doesn 't sound good what 's the point there 's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn 't sound good to you 
 the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language and you can see on this figure that the
  frequency range and the
 decibel range the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous  
 so if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant  what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission 
 because i always view music as the pinnacle of hearing if you can hear music you should be able to hear anything  
 now the problems begin first with pitch perception i mean most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block
  of music and without the ability to perceive pitch well 
 music and melody is a very difficult thing to do forget about a harmony and things like that now this is a midi arrangement of rachmaninoff 's prelude now if we could just play this
  if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves 
 let 's see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone we would be thrilled if we had one
  semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users
  now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation  you distort it a little bit especially in terms of pitch and you 've changed it  and it it might be that you kind of like that 
 that 's kind of hypnotic but it certainly wasn 't the way the music was intended  and you 're not hearing the same thing that most people who have normal hearing are hearing  now
 the other issue comes with not just the ability to tell pitches apart but the ability to tell sounds
  apart  most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument if we could play these two sound clips in succession the trumpet 
 and the second one that 's
 a violin these have similar wave forms they 're both sustained instruments cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments  the sound quality or the sound of the sound is how i like to describe timbre  tone color they
  cannot tell these things whatsoever this implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth  
 now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant and you have them listen to speech have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody what you find is that the auditory cortex is the most active during speech  you would think that because these
  are optimized for speech they were designed for speech  but actually if you look at melody what you find is that there 's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls 
 so for whatever reason this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception  
 now the next question is well how does it really sound  now we 've been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound
  is like for these implant users i 'm going to play you two clips of usher one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies go ahead and play that 
 i had patients tell me that those sound the same 
 they cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips again
  we are very very far away in just getting to where we want to get to now the question comes to mind is there any hope  
 and yes  there is hope now i don 't know if anybody knows who this is this is does somebody know 
 this is beethoven
  now why would we know what beethoven 's skull looks like because his grave was exhumed and
  turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there 
 but beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing  
 what that suggests is that even in the case of hearing loss  the capacity for music remains
 the brains remain hardwired for music  
 i 've been very lucky to work with dr david ryugo where i 've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants this is a cat
  that 's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food
  i 'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we 're hearing it i 'm suggesting that with training
 you can imbue a musical sound with significance even in a cat 
 if we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music because right now there 's virtually no effort put towards that
 no rehabilitative strategies very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music we would come a long way  now
 i want to show you one last video and this is of a student of mine
 named joseph who i had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab he 's deaf  and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant
  and here 's a video of joseph
  although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at
  is now a medical student at yale university  
 and he 's contemplating a surgical career one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery there are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere  
 and this is really unheard of stuff and this is all because of this technology
  and the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain  truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant  because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time you don 't actually have to hear it i know he doesn 't hear well because i 've heard him do karaoke 
 and it 's one of the most awful things heartwarming but awful
  and so there is certainly a lot of hope but there 's a lot more that needs to be done so i just want to conclude with the following words 
 when it comes to restoration of hearing we have certainly come a long way a remarkably long way  
 and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing  and let me tell you right now it 's fine that we would all be very happy with speech but i tell you if we lost our hearing if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing  you would want perfect hearing back
  you would want perfect hearing  
 restoration of basic sensory function is critical and i don 't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function  
 but it 's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring and
 i don 't think that we should give up on beauty and i want to thank you for your time
