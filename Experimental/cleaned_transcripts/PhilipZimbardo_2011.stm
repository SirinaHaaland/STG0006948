  so today i want us to reflect on
 the demise of guys guys are flaming out academically they 're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women other than that there 's not much of a problem 
  so what 's the data so the data on dropping out is amazing 
 boys are thirty percent more likely than girls to drop out of school
  in canada  five boys drop out for every three girls girls outperform boys now at every level from elementary school to graduate school there 's a ten percent differential between
 getting ba 's and all graduate programs with guys falling behind girls two thirds of all students
  remedial programs are guys and as you all know 
 boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder and therefore we drug them with ritalin  
 what 's the evidence of wiping out first it 's a new fear of intimacy intimacy means physical emotional connection with somebody else
 and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous
  every year there 's research done on self reported shyness among college students  and we 're seeing a steady increase among males  and this is two kinds it 's a social awkwardness the old shyness was a fear of rejection  
 it 's a social awkwardness like you 're a stranger in a foreign land they don 't know what to say they don 't know what to do especially one on one [ with
  they don 't know the language of face contact the non verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else  listen to somebody else  
 there 's something i 'm developing here called social intensity syndrome which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating  
 it turns out from earliest childhood boys and then men prefer
  of guys
 physical company  and there 's actually a cortical arousal we 're looking at because guys have been with guys in in teams in clubs in gangs in fraternities 
 especially in the military  
 and then in pubs  and this peaks at super bowl sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers watching a totally overdressed aaron rodgers of the green bay packers rather than jennifer lopez totally naked in the bedroom the problem is they now prefer
  to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships
  what are the causes  well  it 's an unintended consequence i think it 's excessive internet use in general excessive video gaming excessive new
 access to pornography 
 the problem is these are arousal addictions drug addiction you simply want more arousal addiction you want different  drugs you want more of the same different so you need the novelty
  to be sustained  and the problem is the industry is supplying it jane mcgonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is twenty one he 's played ten thousand hours of video games  
 most of that in isolation as you remember  cindy gallop said men don 't know the difference 
 between making love and doing porn the average boy now watches fifty porn video clips a week  and there 's some guy watching a hundred obviously
 and the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in america fifteen billion annually for every four hundred movies made in hollywood there are eleven thousand now made porn porn
 videos  so the effect very quickly is it 's a new kind of arousal boys ' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change
  excitement and constant arousal that means they 're totally out of sync in traditional classes  which are analog static interactively passive they 're also totally out of sync
 in romantic relationships which build gradually and subtly  
 so what 's the solution it 's not my job i 'm here to alarm it 's your job to solve 
 but who
 should care the only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls  educators gamers filmmakers and women
  who would like a real man who they can talk to who can dance who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs  
 no offense to banana slug owners thank you
