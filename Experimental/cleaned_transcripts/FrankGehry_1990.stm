  'm going to go right into the slides and all i 'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff and
 my ideas are in my head anyway they 're very logical and relate to what 's going on
  problem solving for clients
 i either
 convince clients at the end that that i solve their problems or i really do solve their problems because usually they
 seem to like it let me go right into
 the slides can you turn off the
  in the dark  i don 't want you to see what i 'm doing up here anyway i did this house in santa monica  and it
 got a lot of notoriety in fact  it appeared in a porno comic book  which is the slide on the right
  this is in venice  i just show it because i want you to know i 'm concerned about context on the left hand side  
 i had the context of those little houses  and i tried to build a building that fit into that context when people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird  
 and my premise is that
 they make a lot more
  sense when they 're photographed or seen
 in in that space  and then  once i deal with the context  i then try to make a
 a
 place that 's comfortable and private and fairly serene as i hope you 'll find that slide on the right
  and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown  l a i was concerned about making a place for the study of law
  and we continue to work with with this client the building on the
 right at the top is now under construction  the
 garage on the right the gray structure will be torn down finally and
  several small classrooms will be placed along this
 avenue that we 've created this campus  and
 it all related to the clients and the and the students
 from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place they wanted a sense of place  and so the whole idea here was to create
 that kind of space in downtown
  in a neighborhood that
 was difficult to to fit into  and it was my
 theory or my point of view that one didn 't
 upstage the neighborhood one made accommodations i tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the
  they were buildings i liked or not 
 in the ' 60s i started working with paper furniture
 and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in bloomingdale 's 
 we even made flooring walls and everything out of cardboard  
 and the success of it threw me for a loop  i couldn 't deal with the success of furniture i wasn 't
 secure enough as an architect and so i closed it all up and made
  furniture that nobody would like 
 so nobody would like this and it was in this
  preliminary to these pieces of furniture that ricky and i worked on
 furniture by the slice  and
 after we failed i just kept failing
 the piece on the left
 and that ultimately led to the piece on the right happened when the
 kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket  
 and i put a piece of tape around it as you see there  and realized you could sit
  on it and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on so it was an accidental discovery
 i got into fish 
  i mean the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism at po mo and
 said that fish were five hundred million years earlier than man 
 and if you 're going to go back we might as well go back to the beginning  and so i started
 making these funny things  and they
  started to have a life of their own
 and got bigger
 as the one glass at the walker  and then 
 i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and and tried to translate what i was learning about
 the form of the fish and the movement and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it accidental again it was it was
 an
  intuitive kind of thing and i just kept going with it and made this proposal for a building which was only a proposal 
 i did this building in japan  i was
 taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed  and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff 
  i was really drunk
 i was asked to do some sketches on napkins 
 and i made some sketches on napkins little boxes and morandi like things that i used to do  
 and the client said why no fish and so i made a
  it 's harder to do it
  i work with a little once in a while told me i couldn 't do it  and so that made it even more
 exciting  but he was right i couldn 't do the tail i started to get the head ok but the tail
 i couldn 't do it was pretty hard the thing on the right is a snake form a ziggurat
  and i put them together and you walk between them  it was a dialog with the context
 again now if you saw a picture of this as it was published in architectural record
 they didn 't show the context so you would think god what a pushy guy this is but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering
  as for craft and technology and all those things that you 've all been talking about 
 i was thrown for a complete loop this was built in six months the way we sent drawings to
  magic computer in michigan that does carved models  and we used to make foam models  which that thing scanned  we made the drawings of the fish and the
 scales and
 when i got there  everything was perfect
 except the tail 
 so i decided to cut off the head and the
  and i made the object on the left for my show at the walker  and it 's one of the nicest pieces i 've ever made i think and then jay
  and client asked me to do his
 headquarters building in l a for reasons
 we don 't want to talk about it got delayed  toxic waste i guess is the
  so we built a temporary building i 'm getting good at temporary and we put a conference room in that 's a fish 
 and finally jay dragged me to my hometown toronto canada and
 there is a story it 's a real story about my grandmother buying a carp on thursday bringing it home putting it
  when i went to sleep the next day it wasn 't there and the next night we had gefilte fish 
 and so i set up this
 interior for jay 's offices
 and i made a pedestal for a sculpture  and he didn 't buy a sculpture so i made one i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my
  we 've been friends for a long time  and we 've started to work on things a few years ago  we did a
  those two little boys are my sons  and they were claes ' assistants in the play he was the
 swiss army knife  he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter
  and i was frankie p toronto  p for palladio dressed up like the at & t building by claes 
 with a fish hat  
 the highlight of the performance was at the at the end 
 this beautiful object the swiss army knife  which
 i get credit for participating in
 i can tell you it 's totally an oldenburg i had nothing to do with it the only
 thing i did was 
 i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal because i love sailing we made it
 into a sailing craft 
 i 've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing i do it because it 's a
 curious thing in the culture
  are made in such great quantities absorbed in such great quantities  and there 's so much denial about them 
 people hate it and i 'm fascinated with that which like the paper furniture it 's one of those materials and i 'm always drawn to that 
 and so i did a lot of
 dirty things with chain link which nobody will forgive me for but claes made homage to it in the loyola law school  and that chain
  link is really expensive it 's in perspective and everything 
 and then we did a camp together for children with cancer  
 and you can see we
 started making a building together of course the milk can is his 
 but we were trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other like a morandi like the little bottles
  composing them like a still life  and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together
 then jay chiat asked me to do this building 
 on this funny lot in venice  and i started with this three piece
  and you entered in the middle and jay asked me what i was going to do with the piece in the middle  and he pushed that and one day i had a oh well 
 the other way i had the binoculars from claes and i put them there and i could never get rid of them after that
 oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of
 the real proposal  it made my building look sick  and it was this
  interaction between
 that kind of up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting it led to the building on the left 
 and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars
 i have a hard time connecting with
 the craft the whole
 thing about my house the whole use of
 rough carpentry and everything was the frustration with the crafts available i said if i can 't get the craft
 that i want i 'll use the craft i can get there were plenty of models for that in rauschenberg and jasper johns and many artists who were
  making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials
 i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture
 and it was all of one material and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls
 the metalworkers for the most part do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff i was given an opportunity
  design an exhibit for the metalworkers ' unions of america and canada
 in washington  and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all
 future metal buildings  etc etc and it 's working very well to have these
 people these
  i just tell the stories it 's a way of connecting at least with some of those
 people that are so important to the realization
 of architecture 
 the metal continued into a building herman miller in sacramento  and it 's just a complex
  herman miller has this philosophy of having a place a people place i mean it 's kind of a trite
 thing to say but it is
 real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be where the people would come and where the people working would
 interact so it 's out in the middle of
 nowhere
  approach it  it 's copper and galvanize i used the galvanize and copper in a very
 light gauge so it would buckle  i spent a lot of time
 undoing richard meier 's aesthetic  everybody 's trying to get the panels perfect and i
  to get them
 sloppy and fuzzy and they end up looking like stone  this is the
 central area there 's a ramp and that little dome in there is a building by stanley tigerman stanley was
 instrumental in my getting this job  and when i
 was awarded the contract i at the very beginning asked the client if they would
 let stanley do a cameo piece with me because these were ideas that we were talking about
  things next to each other making it 's all about [ a ] metaphor for a city maybe 
 and so stanley did the little dome thing  and we did it over the phone and by fax he would send me a fax and
 show me something he 'd made a building with a dome
  with a simpler building  but he put
 some funny details on it and
 he moved it closer to my building and so i decided to put him in a
 in a depression i put him in a hole and made a kind of a
 hole that he sits in and so then he put two bridges this all happened on the fax going back and forth over a couple
  weeks ' period and he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it  and so then i put this big billboard behind it and
 it was a very prominent building off the freeway and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of
 i thought the language of the neighborhood  which had these cornices projecting cornices mine got a little exuberant
 but i
 used
  which is a beautiful material  and it turns green in one hundred years instead of like copper in ten or fifteen
  we redid the side of the building and re proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space and
 it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved because they have very strict kind of design guideline
 and they wouldn 't normally think i would fit them  
 the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making
 panels and
 fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building 
  ramblas for some film festival i did the hollywood sign going and coming made a building out of it  and
 they built it i flew in one night and took this picture but
 they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me  
 and then more metal and
  in santa monica a little shopping center  
 and this is a laser laboratory at the university of iowa
 in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back  it 's the
 the support labs which by some coincidence
 required no windows and
 the shape
 fit perfectly i just joined the points  in the curved part there 's all the mechanical equipment 
 that solid wall behind it is a
 pipe chase a pipe canyon and so it was an opportunity that i seized because i didn 't have to have any protruding ducts
  or vents or things in this form it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it 
 this is a small house
 somewhere
  they 've been building it so long i don 't remember where it is it
 's in the west valley  and we started with the stream
 and built the house
  along the stream dammed it up to make a lake  these are the models the
 reality with the lake the workmanship is pretty bad 
 and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house when you have to do something really cheaply
 it 's hard to get
 perfect corners and
 that big metal thing is a passage
  you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom which is on the right it
 's kind of like a whole built town  
 i was asked to do a
 hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at yale i thought it was fitting for me to
  be doing that 
 this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota
  the owners
 had a dilemma they asked philip to do it he was too busy  he
  ended up having to make it a sculpture because the dilemma was how do you build a building
 that doesn 't look like the language is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub divided etc etc  you 've got the idea and so we finally ended up making it these people are art collectors  
 and we finally made it
 so it appears very sculptural from the
 the main house and all the windows are on the other side
  and the building is very
 sculptural as you walk around it it 's made of metal and the brown stuff is
  't work i keep trying to make it work in this case we learned how to detail it 
 in cleveland  there 's
 burnham mall on the left it 's never been finished going out to the lake
  you can
  and we had the opportunity to build a
 building on this site there 's a railroad track this is the
 city hall over here somewhere and the courthouse  and
 the centerline of the mall goes out burnham had
 designed a railroad station that was never built and so we followed sohio is on the axis here  and we followed the axis and
  kind of goalposts  and this is our building which is a
 corporate headquarters for an insurance company  we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top folded
 the health
  you drive down so it 's about a 10 story c clamp 
 and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and
 an idea for a very fancy automobile entry this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries  
 and this would be a hotel so the centerline of this thing
 we 'd preserve it  and it would start to work
  with the scale of the new buildings by pelli and kohn pederson fox  etc that are underway
 it 's hard to do high rise i
 i feel much more comfortable down here  this is a piece of property in brentwood and
 a long time ago about ' eighty two or something after my house i designed a house for myself that would be a
 village of several pavilions around a courtyard and and
 the owner of this lot
 worked for me and built that actual model on the left and she came back
  guess wealthier or something something happened and
 asked me to design a house for her on this site 
 and
 following that basic idea of the village  
 we changed it as we got into it  i locked the the house into the site by cutting the back end here you see on the photographs
  of the site
 slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom which i designed like a kind of a barge  
 looking like a boat and
  the dome was a request from the client she wanted a dome somewhere in the house she didn 't care where 
 when you sleep in this bedroom i hope i mean i haven 't slept in it yet i 've offered to marry her so i could sleep there  
 but
 she said i didn 't have to do that but
  you feel like you 're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake and it 's very private the landscape is being built around to create a private garden  and then up above
 there 's a garden
 on this side of the living room and one on the other
  know how to do it from here focus the one on the right it
 's up there  left it 's my right  
 anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees that 's the living
  you enter into the living room and then so on 
 this is the bedroom you come down from this level along the stairway and you enter the bedroom here
 going into the lake and the
 bed is back in this space with windows looking out onto the lake these
  things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow
 lot 
 the material is lead copper like in the building in boston 
 and so it was an intent to
 make this small piece of land it 's one hundred by two hundred and fifty
 into a kind of an estate
 by separating these areas and
 making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it
 and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table
  looks like i got a baldessari painting for free but the idea is the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house
 outside eventually this will be screened these trees will come up
 and it will be very private and you
 feel like you 're in your own kind of village  
 this is for
  michael eisner disney we 're doing some work for him  and this is in
 anaheim california  and it 's a freeway building you go go under this bridge
 at about sixty five miles an hour  and there 's another bridge here and you 're through this room in a split second  and the building will sort of
  on the backside it 's much more humane entrance  dining hall etc  and then this thing here
 i 'm hoping as you drive by you 'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it kind of a
 fun thing to do 
 i 'm doing a building in switzerland basel  which is an office building for a furniture company  
 and
 we struggled with the image
 these are the early studies but
 they have to sell furniture to normal people so if i did the building
 and it was too fancy then people might say well the furniture looks ok in his thing but no it ain 't going to look good in my normal building 
 so we 've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here  and we 've taken the conference facilities and made a villa
 out of them so that the communal space is
  very sculptural and separate  and you 're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of
 interaction between these pieces  this is in paris along the 
  over here the minister of finance the guy that moved from the louvre goes in here  there 's a new library across the river
  and back in here in this already treed park  we 're doing a very dense building called the american center which has a theater
 apartments  dance school an art
 museum  restaurants and all kinds of it 's a very dense program bookstores
  in a very tight small this is the ground level and the french have this
 extraordinary way of
 screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off they call it the plan coupe  and
 i struggled with that thing
 how to get around the corner  these are the models for
  this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing
 so i understood the problem i was trying to get around this plan coupe how do you do it apartments etc
  kind of study models we did 
 and the one on the left is pretty awful  you can see why i was ready to commit suicide when this one was
 built  but out of it came finally this resolution where the
 elevator piece worked frontally to this parallel to this street and also parallel to here and then this kind of
  with this balcony and the skirt kind of like a ballerina
 lifting her skirt to let you into the
 foyer the restaurants here the apartments
 and the theater etc so it would all be built in stone in french limestone  except for this metal piece and
 it faces into a park and the idea was to make this express
 the energy of this 
 on the side
  facing the street it 's much
 more normal except i slipped a few mansards down so that coming on the point these housing units
 made a gesture to the corner  
  you guys have any ideas for it please contact me i don 't know what to do  
 jay chiat is a glutton for punishment and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons  
 and it 's got a fish  and i keep thinking this is going to be the last fish 
 it 's like a drug addict i say i 'm not going to do it anymore i don 't want to do it anymore i 'm not going to do it
  i do it there it is but it 's the living room and this piece here is
 i don 't know what it is i just added it so that we 'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out
  and i 've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier  we 've had a lot of fun working together i think
 i 'm from mars for them and they are for me but somehow we all manage to work together and
 and the hotel that tony baxter 's group is doing
 out here  and then this is a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurants and
 another restaurant   what i did because of the paris skies being quite dull i made a light grid
 that 's perpendicular to the train station to the route of the train  it looks like it
  it 's kind of
 been there  and then crashed all these simpler forms into it the light grid will have a light be lit up
 at night and and give a kind of light ceiling
  rhine across from basel  we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum  
 and i tried to there 's a nick grimshaw building over here there 's an oldenburg sculpture over here i tried to make a
 relationship urbanistically and i don 't gave good slides to show it 's just been completed but
 this piece here is this building and these pieces here and here and as you pass by it 's always
  part you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall
 neighborhood
  it 's plaster and just zinc  
 and you wonder if this is a museum what it 's going to be like inside
  going to be so busy and crazy that
 you wouldn 't show anything  and just wait i 'm so cunning and clever
 i made it quiet and wonderful  but on the outside it does
 scream out at you a bit  
 it 's actually
 basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff and from the building in the back you see it
  iceberg floating by in the hills
 down and becomes that one so it 's pretty quiet inside  
 this is the disney hall the concert hall  it 's
 a complicated project it has a chamber hall  it 's related to an existing
 chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and
  and caring  and it 's not a great building but i approached it optimistically that we would make a
 compositional relationship between us
 that would strengthen both of us and the plan of this it 's a concert hall this is the foyer
  which is kind of a garden structure there 's commercial at the ground floor these are offices which really
 in the competition we didn 't have to design but finally there 's a hotel there  
 these were the kind of relationships made to the chandler  composing these elevations together
 and relating them to the buildings that existed
  in the competition gave us criteria which led to this compartmentalized
 scheme  which we found out after the competition would not work at all but
 everybody liked these forms and liked the space and so that 's one of the problems of a competition you have to then try and
 get that back in some way  and we studied
 many models  this was our original model these were the three
 buildings that were the ideal the concertgebouw boston and berlin  everybody liked the surround
  actually this is the smallest hall in size and it has more seats than any of
  because it has double balconies our client doesn 't want balconies so
 and when we met our new acoustician he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape  and
 we tried many shapes trying to get
 the energy of the original design within an acoustical
 acceptable format
  finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the
 sloping outside walls which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later
 decided they weren 't but now we have them and
 our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and and
 out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room
  the idea  
 and the corners would have skylights and
 these columns would be structural  and the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit 
 and create
 intimacy now 
  this is not a final design these are just
 on the way to being and so i
 wouldn 't take it literally except the feeling of the space  we studied the acoustics with laser
 stuff  and they bounce them off this and see where it all works but you get the sense of the hall in section
 most halls come straight down into a
  this case we 're opening it back up
 and getting skylights in the four corners and so it will be quite a different
 shape 
 the
 original building  
 because it was frog like fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well when you get into a box it 's harder to do it
 and here we are struggling with how to put the hotel in
  teapot i designed for alessi  i just stuck it on there  but
 this is how i do work i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away and of course it 's not going to look like that but
 it is the
 crazy way i tend to work  and then finally
  i was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of interstate
 bank tower the highest building in l a larry halprin is doing the stairs and
 i was asked to do a fish and so i did a snake 
 laughter it 's a public space and i made it kind of a garden structure and you can go in it it 's a kiva and larry 's putting some water in there  and it
 works much better than a fish in barcelona i was asked to do a fish and
  're working on that at the foot of a ritz carlton tower being done by skidmore owings and merrill and the  ritz carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel
 much like those old gas tanks  and so we took the
 language of this exposed steel and and used it perverted it into the form of the
 and created a kind of a 19th century contraption that looks like 
 that will sit this is the beach and the harbor out in front  and this is really a shopping center with department stores  and we split these bridges
 originally this was all solid with a hole in it we
 cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel
  this to the hotel people the other day  and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz carlton anymore 
 because of this fish 
 and finally i just threw these in lou danziger i didn 't expect lou danziger
  to be here but this is a building i did for him in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four i think a little studio and it 's
 sadly for sale time goes on  and this is my son
 working with me on a small fast food thing
 he designed the robot as the cashier
  head moves and i did the rest of it and the food wasn 't as good as the stuff and so it
 failed it should have been the other way around the food should have been good first it didn 't work
