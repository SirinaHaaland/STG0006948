  about a year ago i asked myself a question knowing what i know why am i not a vegetarian 
 after all i 'm one of the green guys  i grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin i started a site called
  treehugger
 i care about this stuff  
 i knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third  
 cruelty  i knew that the ten billion animals we raise each year for meat
 are raised in factory farm conditions that we hypocritically  wouldn 't even consider for our own cats
 dogs and other pets  
 environmentally 
 meat amazingly  
 causes more emissions than all of transportation combined  cars trains planes buses boats all of it 
 and beef production uses one hundred times the water that most vegetables do  
 i also knew that i 'm not alone
  we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s 
 so what was once the special little side treat now is the main much more regular  so really any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian yet 
 there i was chk chk chk tucking into a big old steak  
 so why was i stalling
  i realized that what i was being pitched was a binary solution  it was either you 're a meat eater or you 're a vegetarian  
 and i guess i just wasn 't quite ready  imagine
 your last hamburger 
 laughter so my common sense my good intentions
  conflict with my taste buds  and i 'd commit to doing it later 
 and not surprisingly later never came  sound familiar  
 so i wondered might there be a third solution  
 and i thought about it and i came up with one i 've been doing it for the last year and it 's great it 's called weekday veg  
 the name says it all
 nothing with a face monday through friday  on the weekend your choice simple
  been
  the animals what 's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot  after all if all of us
 ate half as much meat it would be like half of us were vegetarians
