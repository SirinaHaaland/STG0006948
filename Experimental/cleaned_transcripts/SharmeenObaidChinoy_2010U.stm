  i want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens 
 in two thousand and nine there were five hundred bomb blasts across pakistan  i spent the year working with children who were training to become
  suicide bombers and with taliban recruiters trying to understand how the taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children 
 were actively signing up to their cause  i want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film children of the taliban
  the taliban now run their own schools  
 they target poor families and convince the parents to send their children 
 in return  they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend
  we 've obtained a propaganda video made by the taliban  young boys are taught
  justifications for suicide attacks
 and the execution of spies  i made contact with a child from swat
 who studied in a madrassa like this hazrat ali is from a poor farming family in swat he joined the taliban a year ago
  he tells me that children are then given months of military training
  seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children and i think it 's a  five step process 
 step one is that the taliban prey on families that are large that are poor that live in rural areas  
 they separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food clothing shelter to these children then they ship them off hundreds
  schools that run along the taliban agenda  step two 
 they teach the children the koran  which is islam 's holiest book in arabic a language these children do not understand and cannot speak  they rely very heavily on 
 teachers who i have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to 
  reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded 
 effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children  
 step three the taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in 
 so they beat these children
 i have seen it 
 they feed them twice a day dried bread and water  they rarely allow them to play games  
 they tell them that for eight hours at a time all they have to do is read the koran 
 the children are virtual prisoners  they cannot leave  they cannot go home their parents are so poor they have no resources
  to get them back  
 step four the older members of the taliban the fighters  start talking to the younger boys about the glories of martyrdom  
 they talk to them about how when they die  they will be received up up with lakes of honey and milk 
 how there will be seventy two virgins waiting for them in paradise how there will be unlimited
  and how this glory is going to propel them to become heroes in their neighborhoods effectively  this is
 the brainwashing process that has begun step five i believe the taliban have one of the most effective means of
 propaganda their videos that they use are intercut with
 photographs of men and women and children dying in iraq and afghanistan and in pakistan
  and the basic message is that the western powers do not care about civilian deaths so those people who live
 in areas and support governments that work with western powers are fair game that 's why pakistani civilians  over six thousand of whom have been killed in the last
 two years alone are fair game  now these children are primed to become suicide bombers they 're ready to go out and fight because
  they 've been told that this is effectively their only way to glorify islam  i want you to watch another excerpt from the film
 this boy is called zenola  he blew himself up killing six 
 this boy is
  this boy is called messoud he killed twenty eight 
 the taliban are running suicide schools  preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians
  to eradicate evil for islam
  i leave you all with this thought  if you grew up in these circumstances faced with these choices would you choose to live
 in this world
 or in the glorious afterlife as one taliban recruiter told me there will always be sacrificial lambs in this war
