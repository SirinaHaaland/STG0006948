  a remarkable moment in time  we face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations
 that will determine whether the next one hundred years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries  let me illustrate with an example
 i first visited beijing twenty five years ago to teach at the people 's university of china 
 china was getting serious about market economics and about university education so they decided to call in the
 foreign experts  like most other people i moved around beijing
  from dodging the occasional vehicle it was a safe and easy way to get around 
 cycling in beijing now is a completely different prospect
  the roads are jammed by cars and trucks the air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal
 and diesel  when i was there last in the spring there was an advisory for people of my age
  to stay indoors and not move much how did this come about it came from
 the way in which beijing has grown as a city  
 it 's doubled over those twenty five years more than doubled from ten million to twenty million  it 's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel dirty energy particularly coal 
 china burns half
 the world 's coal each year  and that 's why
 it is a key reason why it is the world 's largest emitter
 of greenhouse gases 
 at the same time  we have to recognize that in that period china has grown remarkably 
 it has become the world 's second largest economy  hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty 
 that 's really
  the same time the people of china are asking the question what 's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable 
 they 've analyzed  diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development 
 china 's planning to scale back coal  it 's
 looking to build its cities in different ways 
 now the growth of china is part of a dramatic change fundamental change
 in the structure of the world economy 
 just twenty five years ago  the developing countries the poorer countries of the world were 
 notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people they accounted for only about a third of the world 's output  
 now it 's more than half twenty five years from now it will probably be two thirds from
  the countries that we saw twenty five years ago as developing that 's a remarkable change  it means that most countries around the world  rich or poor are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that i want to talk about
 and highlight now the first of these transformations
 is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that i 've already begun to illustrate
 through the
  percent now in urban areas that 's going to go to seventy percent in two thousand and fifty 
 over the next two decades we 'll see the demand for energy rise by forty percent and the growth
 in the economy and in the population
 is putting increasing pressure on our land on our water and on our forests 
  structural change if we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way 
 we will create waste pollution  
 congestion  destruction of land and forests  if we think of those three areas that i have illustrated with my numbers cities  
 energy land if we manage all that badly  then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods
  the people around the world would be poor and damaged and more than that the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise 
 with immense risks to our climate concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already
 higher than they 've been for millions of years  if we go on increasing those
  we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years 
 we 've been around as homo sapiens that 's a rather generous definition sapiens
 for perhaps a quarter of a million years a quarter of a million  we risk temperatures we haven 't seen for tens of millions of years over a century 
 that would transform the relationship between human beings
 and
 the planet it
  would lead to
 changing deserts  changing rivers changing patterns of hurricanes changing sea levels hundreds of millions of people 
 perhaps billions of people who would have to move and if we 've learned anything from history  that means severe and extended conflict  and we couldn 't just turn it
  you can 't make a peace treaty with the planet you can 't negotiate with the laws of physics you 're in there you 're stuck 
 those are the stakes we 're playing for and that 's why we have to make this second transformation  the climate
 transformation  and move to a low carbon economy  
 now the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway  we have to decide whether to do it well or badly the economic or structural transformation but the second of the transformations
  the climate transformations we have to decide to do 
 those two transformations face us in the next two decades the next two decades are
 decisive for what we have to do 
 now the more i 've thought about this the two transformations coming together  the more i 've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity it
 's an opportunity which we can use
  an opportunity which we can lose  
 and let me explain through those three key areas that i 've identified cities  energy and land and let me start with cities 
 i 've already described the problems of beijing  
 pollution  congestion waste and so on surely we recognize that
 in many of our cities around the world now with cities  like life but particularly
  you have to think ahead  the cities that are going to be built and there are many  and many big ones
 we have to think of how to design them in a compact way
 so we can save travel time and we can save energy  the cities that already are there well established 
 we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities  and make it easier encourage more people to live closer to the center  
  examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that 
 the bus rapid transport system in bogot in colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non polluting way
 in a city very frequent buses strongly protected routes the same service really as an
  railway system but much much cheaper and can be done much more quickly a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that 's developing  now  some things in cities do take time some things in cities can happen much more quickly  
 take my hometown london 
 in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two smog in london
 killed four thousand people and badly damaged the lives of many many more and
  those of you live outside london in the u k will remember it used to be called the smoke  
 that 's the way london was by regulating coal within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly
 reduced i remember the smogs well  when the visibility dropped to [ less ] than
 a few meters they stopped the buses and i had to walk
  but it was changed it was changed by a decision 
 good decisions can bring good results  
 striking results quickly  we 've seen more in london we 've introduced the congestion charge actually quite quickly and effectively  
 and we 've seen great improvements in the bus system  and cleaned up
 the bus system  you can see that the two transformations i 've described the structural and the climate
  come very much together  but we have to invest we have to invest in our cities and we have to invest wisely  and if we do we 'll see
 cleaner cities  quieter cities  safer cities more attractive cities  more productive cities  and stronger community in those cities public transport recycling reusing all sorts of things that bring communities
 together  we can do that
 but we have to think we have to invest we have to plan let me turn to energy 
 now energy over the last twenty five years has increased by about fifty percent eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels over the next twenty years  
 perhaps it will increase by another forty percent or so 
 we have to invest strongly in energy  we have to use it much more efficiently
  and we have to make it clean we can see how to do that take the example of california it would be in the top ten countries in the world if it was independent
 around twenty percent in renewables wind solar and so on to over thirty three percent and that would bring california back to greenhouse gas emissions 
  in two thousand and twenty to where they were in one thousand nine hundred and ninety a period when the economy in california would more or less have doubled  that 's a striking achievement it shows what can be done not just california the incoming government of india is planning to get
  solar technology to light up the homes of four hundred million people who don 't have electricity in india they 've set themselves a target of five years  
 i think they 've got a good chance
 of doing that we 'll see but what you 're seeing now is people moving much more quickly four hundred million more than the population
 of the united states those are the kinds of ambitions now
 people are setting themselves in terms
  of rapidity of
 of change  again you can see
 good decisions can bring quick results  and those two transformations the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon are intimately intertwined do the first one well the structural the second one on the climate becomes
  look at land land and particularly forests forests
 are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species they hold water in the soil
 and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere fundamental to the tackling of climate change  but we 're losing
 our forests in the last decade  we 've lost a forest area the size of portugal and much more has been degraded
 but we 're already seeing that we can do so much about that we can recognize the problem but we can also understand how to tackle it 
 in brazil the rate of deforestation has been reduced by seventy percent
 over the last ten years  
 how by involving local communities investing in their agriculture and their economies by monitoring more carefully by enforcing the
  law more strictly 
 and it 's not just stopping deforestation that 's of course of first and fundamental importance 
 but it 's also regrading degraded land regenerating rehabilitating degraded land  
 i first went to ethiopia in 
 it was desperately
  in the following years it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict over the last few years  actually more than a few 
 ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly it has ambitions to be a middle income country fifteen years
 from now
 and to be carbon neutral  again i think
 it 's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one  you 're seeing that commitment there you 're seeing what can be done ethiopia is investing in clean energy it
  working in the rehabilitation of land 
 in humbo in southwest ethiopia a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest 
  management has led to big increases in living standards so we can see 
  from california to india from brazil to ethiopia we do understand
 how to manage those two transformations  the structural and the climate  we do understand how to manage those well  
 and technology is changing very rapidly  i don 't have to list all those things to an audience like this but you can see the electric cars
  you can see the batteries using new materials you can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we 're away you can see better insulation and there 's much more coming 
 but and it 's a big but 
 the world as a whole is moving far too slowly 
 we 're not cutting emissions in the way we should we 're not managing those structural transformations
 as we can  the depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change
  change are not there yet  
 the depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet  
 we need political pressure
 to build  we need leaders to step up we can have better
 growth better climate a better world
 we can make by managing those two transformations well the next one hundred years
 the best of centuries  
 if we make a mess of it we you and me if we make a mess of it if we don 't manage those transformations properly it will be the
 next one hundred years will be the worst
 of centuries  that 's the major conclusion
 of the report on the economy and climate
 chaired by  ex president felipe caldern
 of mexico and i co chaired that with him  and we handed that report yesterday here in new york in the united nations building to the secretary general of the 
 we know that we can do this
  our daughter gave birth to rosa here in new york two weeks ago  here are
  two weeks old 
 are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye
 and tell them that we understood the issues that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities  and still we failed to act
  let 's make the next one hundred years the best of centuries
