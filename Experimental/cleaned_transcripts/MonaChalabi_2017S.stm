  be talking about statistics today if that makes you immediately feel a little bit wary that 's ok  that doesn 't make you some kind of crazy conspiracy theorist 
 it makes you skeptical  and when it comes to numbers especially now
  you should be skeptical  but you should also be able to tell which numbers are reliable and which ones aren 't so today i want to try to give you some tools to be able to do that 
 but before i do i just want to clarify which numbers i 'm talking about here i
 'm not talking about claims like nine out of ten women recommend this anti aging cream i think a lot of us always roll our eyes at numbers like that 
 what 's different now is people are questioning statistics like the us unemployment rate is five percent what makes this claim different is it doesn 't come from a private company  it comes from the government
 about four out of ten americans distrust the economic data that gets reported by government among supporters of president trump it 's even higher it 's about seven out of ten
 i don 't need to tell anyone here that there are a lot of dividing lines in our society right now 
 and a lot of them start to make sense  once you understand people 's relationships with these government numbers
 on the one hand  there are those who say these statistics are crucial that we need them to make sense of
  society as a whole in order to move beyond emotional anecdotes and measure progress in an [ objective ] way 
 and then there are the others who say that these statistics are elitist maybe even rigged  they don 't make sense and they don 't really reflect what 's happening in people 's everyday lives
 it kind of feels like that second group is winning the argument right now we 're living in a world of alternative facts where people don 't find statistics this kind of common ground this starting point for debate
 this is a problem 
 there are actually moves in the us right now to get rid of some government statistics altogether right now there 's a bill in congress about measuring racial inequality 
 the draft law says that government money should not be used to collect data on racial segregation  this is a total disaster if we don 't have this data how can we observe discrimination
  let alone fix it in other words how can a government create fair policies if they can 't measure current levels of unfairness
 this isn 't just about discrimination it 's everything think about it how can we legislate on health care if we don 't have good data on health or poverty how can we have public debate about immigration if we can 't at least agree on how many people are entering and leaving the country 
 statistics come from the state that 's where they got their name the point was to better
  measure the population in order to better serve it
 so we need these government numbers but we also have to move beyond either blindly accepting or blindly rejecting them we need to learn the skills to be able to spot bad statistics 
 i started to learn some of these when i was working in a statistical department that 's part of the united nations
 our job was to find out how many iraqis had been forced from their homes as a result of the war and what they needed  it was really important work but it was also
  every single day we were making decisions that affected the accuracy of our numbers
 decisions like which parts of the country we should go to who we should speak to which questions we should ask 
 and i started to feel really disillusioned with our work  because we thought we were doing a really good job  
 but the one group of people who could really tell us were the iraqis and they rarely got the chance to find our analysis let alone question it  
 so i started to feel really determined that the one way to make numbers more accurate is to have as many people as possible be able to question them
  so i became a data journalist my job is finding these data sets and sharing them with the public
 anyone can do this you don 't have to be a geek or a nerd you can ignore those words they 're used by people trying to say they 're smart while pretending they 're humble absolutely anyone can do this 
 i want to give you guys three questions that will help you be able to spot some bad
  question number one is can you see uncertainty
 one of things that 's really changed people 's relationship with numbers and even their trust in the media  has been the use of political polls
 i personally have a lot of issues with political polls because
 i think the role of journalists is actually to report the facts and not attempt to predict them  
 especially when those predictions can actually damage democracy by signaling to people don 't bother to vote for that guy he doesn 't have a chance let 's set that aside for now and talk about the accuracy of this endeavor
  based on national elections
 in the uk  italy
  israel and of course the most recent us presidential election 
 using polls to predict electoral outcomes is about as accurate as using the moon to predict hospital admissions 
 no seriously i used actual data from an academic study to draw this 
 there are a lot of reasons why polling has become so inaccurate our societies have become really diverse which makes it difficult for pollsters
  to get a really nice representative sample of the population for their polls people are really reluctant to answer their phones to pollsters and also shockingly enough people might lie  
 but you wouldn 't necessarily know that to look at the media 
 for one thing the probability of a hillary clinton win was communicated with decimal places we don 't use decimal places to describe the temperature
  how on earth can predicting the behavior of two hundred and thirty million voters in this country be that precise  
 and then there were those sleek charts 
 see a lot of data visualizations will overstate certainty  and it works these charts can numb our brains to criticism 
 when you hear a statistic you might feel skeptical as soon as it 's buried in a chart it feels like some kind of objective science  and it 's not 
 so i was trying to find ways to better communicate this to people to show people the uncertainty in our numbers what i did was i started taking
  data sets and turning them into hand drawn visualizations so that people can see how imprecise the data is so people can see that a human did this a human found the data and visualized it
 for example instead of finding out the probability of getting the flu in any given month  you can see the rough distribution of flu season  this is 
 a bad shot to show in
  also more responsible data visualization because if you were to show the exact probabilities  maybe that would encourage people to get their flu jabs at the wrong time
 the point of these shaky lines is so that people remember these these imprecisions but also so they don 't necessarily walk away with a specific number but they can remember important facts 
 facts like injustice and inequality leave a huge mark on our lives  
 facts like black americans and native americans have shorter life expectancies than those of other
  races  and that isn 't changing anytime soon 
 facts like prisoners in the us can be kept in solitary confinement cells that are smaller than the size of an average parking space
 the point of these visualizations is also to remind people of some really important statistical concepts  concepts like averages so let 's say you hear a claim like the average
 swimming pool in the us contains six point two three fecal accidents that doesn 't mean every single swimming pool in the country contains exactly six point two three turds  
 so in order to show that i went back to the original data which comes from the cdc who surveyed forty seven swimming facilities  and i just spent one evening redistributing poop  so you can kind of see how misleading averages can be
 ok  so the second question that you guys should be asking yourselves to spot bad numbers is can i see myself in the data
  is also about averages in a way 
 because part of the reason why people are so frustrated with these national statistics 
 is they don 't really tell the story of who 's winning and who 's losing from national policy it
 's easy to understand why people are frustrated with global averages when they don 't match up with their personal experiences 
 i wanted to show people the way data relates to their everyday lives 
 i started this advice column called dear mona where people would write to me with questions and concerns and i 'd try to answer them with data people asked me anything questions like is it normal to sleep in a separate bed to my wife 
 do people regret their tattoos 
 what does it mean to die of natural causes 
 all of these questions are great because they make you think about ways to find and communicate these numbers if someone asks you how much pee is a lot of pee which is a question that i got asked
  you really want to make sure that the visualization makes sense to as many people as possible these numbers aren 't unavailable  sometimes they 're just
 buried in the appendix of an academic study and they 're certainly not inscrutable if you really wanted to test these numbers on urination volume you could grab a bottle and try it for yourself 
 the point of this isn 't necessarily that every single data set has to relate specifically to you 
 i 'm interested in how many women were issued fines in france for wearing the face veil or the niqab even if i don 't live in france or wear the face veil
 the point of asking where you fit in is to get as much context as possible so it
 's about zooming out from one data point like the unemployment rate is five percent and seeing how it changes over time 
 or seeing how it changes by educational status this is why your parents always wanted you to go to college
 or seeing how it varies by gender  nowadays male unemployment rate is higher than the female unemployment rate up until the early ' 80s it was the other way around
 this is a story of one of the biggest changes that 's happened in american society and it 's all there in that chart  once you look beyond the averages 
 the axes are everything  once you change the scale  you can change the story  
 ok so the third and final question that i want you guys to think about when you 're looking at statistics is how was the data collected
  so far
  only talked about the way data is communicated but the way it 's collected matters just as much i know this is tough because methodologies can be opaque and actually kind of boring but there are some simple steps you can take to check this 
 i 'll use one last example here 
 one poll found that forty one percent of muslims in this country support jihad  which is obviously pretty scary and it was reported everywhere in two thousand and fifteen
 when i want to check a number like that i 'll start off by finding the original questionnaire  it turns out that journalists who reported on that statistic
 ignored a question lower down on the survey that asked respondents how they defined jihad and most of them defined it as 
 muslims ' personal  peaceful struggle to be more religious only sixteen percent defined it as violent holy war against unbelievers 
 this is the really important important point  based on those numbers it 's totally possible that no one in the survey who defined it as violent holy war also said they support it those two groups
  might not overlap at all it
 's also worth asking how the survey was carried out this was something called an opt in poll which means anyone could have found it on the internet and completed it there 's no way of knowing if those people even identified as muslim  
 and finally there were six hundred respondents in that poll there are roughly three million muslims in this country according to pew research center that means the poll spoke to roughly one in every five thousand muslims in this country
  the reasons why government statistics are often better than private statistics a poll might speak to a couple hundred people  maybe a thousand or if you 're l 'oreal trying to sell skin care products in two thousand and five then you spoke to forty eight women to claim that they work 
 laughter private companies don 't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right they just need the right numbers government
  aren 't like that in theory at least they 're totally impartial not least because most of them do their jobs regardless of who 's in power they 're civil servants  
 and to do their jobs properly they don 't just speak to a couple hundred people 
 those unemployment numbers i keep on referencing come from the bureau of labor statistics and to make their estimates they speak to over one hundred and forty thousand businesses in this country
 i get it it 's frustrating if you want to test a statistic that comes from a private company you can buy the face cream for you and a bunch of friends test it out if it doesn 't work
  you can say the numbers were wrong but how do you question government statistics you just keep checking everything find out how they collected the numbers find out if you 're seeing everything on the chart you need to see 
 but don 't give up on the numbers altogether because if you do we 'll be making public policy decisions in the dark using nothing but private interests to guide us thank you
