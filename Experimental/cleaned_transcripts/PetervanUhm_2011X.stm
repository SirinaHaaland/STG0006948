  military commander
 of the netherlands  with troops stationed around the world  i 'm really honored
 to be here today when i look around this tedxamsterdam venue  i see
  very special audience 
 you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today 
 when i look around  i see people who want to make a contribution i see people who want to make a
  by doing groundbreaking scientific work by creating impressive works of art by writing critical articles
 or inspiring books by starting up sustainable businesses  
 and you all have chosen your own instruments
 to fulfill this mission of creating
  a better world  some chose the microscope
 as their instrument  others chose dancing
 or painting or making music like we just heard  some chose the pen  others work
 through the instrument of money  ladies and gentlemen  i made a different choice
  ladies and gentlemen
  i share the goals of the speakers you heard before 
 i did not
 choose to take up
 the pen  the brush  the camera  i chose
 this
  and you heard already  being so close to this gun
 may make you feel uneasy  it may even feel scary a real gun
 at a few feet 's distance  let us stop for a moment
 and feel this uneasiness you could even hear it let us
 the fact that probably most of you
 have never been close to a gun  it means
 the netherlands is a peaceful country the netherlands is not at war  
 it means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets 
 guns
 are not a part of our lives
 in many countries  it is a different story in many
 countries people are confronted with guns  they are oppressed they are intimidated
 by warlords by terrorists by criminals weapons can do a lot of harm
  they are the cause of much distress why then am i standing before you with this weapon 
 why did i choose the gun as my instrument 
 today i want to tell you why today i want to tell you why i chose the gun to create a better
  and i want to tell you how this gun can help 
 my story starts in the city of nijmegen
 in the east of the netherlands  the city where i was born 
 my father was a hardworking baker  
 but when he had finished work in the bakery
  often told me and my brother stories and most of the time  he told me this story i 'm going to share with you now 
 the story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier
 in the dutch armed forces
 at the beginning of the second world war  the nazis invaded the netherlands their grim plans were evident
 they meant to rule by means of repression  diplomacy
 had failed to stop the germans only brute force
 remained  it was our last resort 
 my father was there to provide it as the son of a farmer
 who knew how to hunt
  my father was an excellent marksman when he aimed  he never missed 
 at this decisive moment in dutch history my father was positioned
 on the bank of the river waal near the city of nijmegen 
 he had a clear shot at the german soldiers who came to occupy a free country  his country
 our country  
 he fired  nothing happened he fired again no german soldier fell to the ground 
 my father
 had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank  
 hitler 's troops marched on
 my father could do about it 
 until the day my father died  he was frustrated about missing these shots  
 he could have done something but with an old gun not even the best marksman in the armed forces
 could have hit the mark so this story
 stayed with me
  then in high school i was gripped by the stories of the allied soldiers
 soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country
 and a people that they didn 't know they liberated my birth town
  it was then that i decided i would take up the gun
 out of respect and gratitude
 for those men and women who came to liberate us  from the awareness that sometimes
 only the gun
 can stand between good and evil  and that is why i took up the gun
  not to shoot not to kill not to destroy  but to stop those who would do evil 
 to protect the vulnerable 
 to defend democratic values 
 to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in amsterdam
 about how we can make the world a better place
 ladies and gentlemen  i do not stand here today
 to tell you about the glory of weapons  i do not like guns  and once
 you have been under fire yourself  it brings home even more clearly
 that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about
  i stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability 
 the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world
  now this may sound
 contradictory to you but not only have i seen with my own eyes
 during my deployments in lebanon sarajevo and as the netherlands ' chief of defence 
 this is also supported by cold hard statistics 
 violence has declined dramatically
 over the last five hundred years  despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news
 between developed countries are no longer commonplace  the murder rate in europe has dropped by a factor of thirty
 since the middle ages  and occurrences of civil war and repression have declined
 since the end of the cold war  statistics show that we are living in a relatively
 peaceful era why
  why has violence decreased has the human mind changed  well we were talking about the human mind this morning 
 did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge 
 for violent rituals for pure rage 
 or is there something else 
 in his latest book  harvard professor steven pinker
 and many other thinkers before him concludes that one of 
 the the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state
 and the introduction on a large scale of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence
 legitimized by a democratically
 elected government legitimized by checks and balances
 and an independent judicial system in other words a state monopoly
 that has the use of violence well under control 
 such a state monopoly on violence first of all serves as a reassurance
 it removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies  
 secondly  the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence
 tips the balance even further  abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war
  now
 nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel  it enhances peace even further  
 where there is no conflict  trade flourishes  
 and trade is another important incentive against violence with trade there 's mutual interdependency
 and mutual gain between parties
  and when there is mutual gain both sides stand to lose more than they would gain
 if they started a war 
 war is simply no longer the best option  and that is why violence
 has decreased 
  ladies and gentlemen is the rationale behind the existence
 of my armed forces 
 the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence 
 we do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us
 to do so  it is this legitimate  controlled use of the gun
 that has contributed greatly to reducing
  the statistics of war conflict
 and violence around the globe  it is this participation in peacekeeping missions
 that has led to the resolution of many civil wars my soldiers
 use the gun as an instrument of peace and this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous
  failed states have no legitimized democratically controlled use of force failed states do not know of the gun
 as an instrument of peace and stability 
 that is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict 
 that is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state
  is such an important aspect
 of our foreign missions that is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in afghanistan 
 that is why we train police officers we train judges  we train public prosecutors around the world  
 and that is why and in the netherlands we are very unique in that
  dutch constitution states
 that one of the main tasks of the armed forces
 is to uphold and promote the international rule of law  
 ladies and gentlemen  looking at this gun we are confronted with the ugly side of the
  development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat
 into hope  and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded
 and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression
 we will have to make ideals and human failure
 meet somewhere in the middle until that day comes  i stand for my father
 who tried to shoot the nazis with an old gun  i stand for my men and women
 who are prepared to risk their lives for a less
  violent world for all of us  i stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss
 and sustained permanent injuries to her leg  when she was hit
 by a rocket on a mission in afghanistan  
  until the day comes when we can do away with the gun  i hope we all agree
 that peace and stability do not come free of charge  
 it takes hard work  often behind the scenes  it takes good equipment
 and well trained dedicated soldiers
  i hope
 you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain
 and provide her with a good gun  instead of the bad gun my father was given i hope you will support our soldiers
 when they are out there when they come home
 and when they are injured and need our care they put their lives on the line
  for us for you and we cannot let them down i hope
 you will respect my soldiers this soldier
 with this gun  because she wants a better world  because she makes an active contribution
