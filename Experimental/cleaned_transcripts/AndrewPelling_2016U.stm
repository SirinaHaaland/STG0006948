  i 've got a confession  
 i love looking through people 's garbage
  now it 's not some creepy thing  i 'm usually just looking for old electronics stuff i can take to my workshop and hack   
  each one 's got three different motors  so now you can build things that move  there 's switches so you can turn things on and off there 's even a freaking laser so you can make a cool robot
 into an awesome robot 
 now i 've built a lot of stuff out of garbage  and some of these things have even been kind of useful  but here 's the thing for
  is just a chance to play to be creative and build things to amuse myself this is what i love doing  so i just made it part of my day job  
 i lead a  university based biological research lab where we value curiosity and exploration above all else we aren 't focused on any particular problem  and we 're not 
  trying to solve any particular disease this is just a place where people can come and ask fascinating questions and find answers  
  i challenge people to build the equipment they need out of the garbage i find it 's a great way to foster creativity  
 and what happened was that artists and scientists from around the world started coming to my lab  
 and it 's not just because we value unconventional ideas it 's because we test and validate them with scientific rigor  
 so
 one day i was
  it apart and i had this sudden idea 
 could i treat biology like hardware  could i dismantle a biological system mix and match the parts and then put it back together in some new and creative way
 my lab started working on this and i want to show you the result 
 can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is
  now  i actually want you to notice as well that this is a lot redder than most apples  and that 's because we grew human cells into it we took
 a totally innocent macintosh apple removed all the apple cells and dna
 and then implanted human cells and what we 're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold this is the stuff that gives plants their
  shape and texture  and these little holes that you can see this is where all the apple cells used to be 
 so then we come along we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue  what happens is these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold
 as weird as this is 
 it 's actually really reminiscent of how our own
  you can implant these scaffolds into the body and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive 
 this is the point when people started asking me andrew can you make body parts out of apples 
 and i 'm like you 've come to the right place i actually brought this up with my wife she 's a musical instrument maker  and she does a lot of wood
  carving for a living so i asked her 
 could you like  literally carve some ears out of an apple for us and she did  so
 i took her ears to the lab we then started preparing them  yeah i know laughter
 it 's a good lab man 
 and then we grew cells on them
 and this is the result  listen my lab is not in the
 business  
 people have actually been working on this for decades here 's the issue  
 commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic  because they 're sourced from proprietary products animals or cadavers
 we used an apple
 and it cost pennies
  what 's also really cool here is it 's not that hard to make these things 
 the equipment you need can be built from garbage and the key processing step only requires soap and water  
 so what we did was put all the instructions online as open source 
 and then we
  founded a mission driven company  and we 're developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home what i 'm really curious 
  about is if one day it will be possible to repair rebuild and augment our own bodies
  they 're tasty and they make your pee smell funny 
 now  i was in my kitchen  and i was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus what you can see are all these tiny little vessels 
 and when we image them in the lab you can see how the cellulose forms these structures 
 this image reminds me of two things our blood vessels
 and the structure and organization of our nerves
 and spinal cord  so here 's the question 
 can we grow axons and neurons down these channels because if we can then maybe we can use asparagus
 to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves or maybe even a spinal cord 
  don 't get me wrong this is exceptionally challenging and really hard work to do and we are not the only ones working on this 
 but we are the only ones using asparagus laughter
 right now we 've got really promising pilot data and we 're working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeons to find out what 's actually possible 
 so listen all of the work i 've shown
  the stuff that i 've built that 's all around me on this stage and the other projects my lab is involved in are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage 
 play
 play
 is a key part of my scientific practice it 's how i train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative
 and to decide to make human apple ears so the next time
  i want you to think of me  
 because i want it seriously  please find any way to get in touch with me  and let 's see what we can build 
 thank you
