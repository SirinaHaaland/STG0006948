  i 'm a lexicographer i make dictionaries and my job as a lexicographer is to try to put all the words possible into the dictionary 
 my job is not to decide what a word is 
 that
 is your job everybody who speaks english decides together
  what 's a word and what 's not a word every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other 
 now  sometimes when people are trying to decide whether a word is good or bad
  they don 't really have a good reason so they say something like because grammar 
 i don 't actually really care about grammar too much don 't tell anybody  but the word grammar actually there are two kinds of grammar
 there 's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain and if you 're a native speaker of a language or a good speaker of a language it 's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language 
 and this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child and here 's an example this is a wug right it 's a wug 
 now there is another
  you know how to make the plural of wug that rule lives in your brain you never had to be taught this rule you just understand it this is an experiment that was invented by a professor at [ boston university ] named jean berko gleason back in 
 so we 've been talking about this for a long time now
  these kinds of natural rules that exist in your brain they 're not like traffic laws they 're more like laws of nature and
  has to remind you to obey a law of nature right when you leave the house in the morning your mom doesn 't say hey honey i think it 's going to be cold take a hoodie don 't forget to obey the law of gravity 
 nobody says this now there are other rules
 that are more about manners than they are about nature
  so you can think of a word as like a hat  
 once you know how hats work nobody has to tell you don 't wear hats on your feet what they have to tell you is can you wear hats inside who gets to wear a hat 
 what are the kinds of hats you get to wear those are more of the second kind of grammar  which linguists often call usage as opposed to grammar  
  to discourage people from making up words and i think that is well stupid  so for example 
 people are always telling you be creative make new music do art  invent things science and technology but when it comes to words they 're like don 't no creativity stops right here whippersnappers give it a rest 
 laughter but that makes
  no sense to me words are great we should have more of them i want you to make as many new words
 as possible 
 and i 'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in english 
 the first way is the simplest way basically steal them from other languages [ go rob other people ] linguists
 call this borrowing but we never give the words back so i 'm just going to be honest and call it stealing
  we usually take words for things that we like
  like delicious food we took kumquat from chinese we took caramel from french we also take words for cool things like ninja right we took that from japanese  which is kind of a cool trick because ninjas are hard to steal from 
 so
 another way that you can make words in english is by squishing two other english words together this is called compounding words in english are like lego if you use enough
  force you can put any two of them together 
 we do this all the time in english words like heartbroken bookworm sandcastle all are compounds so go ahead and make words like duckface just don 't make duckface 
 another way that you can make words in english is
  instead you use so much force when you squish the words together that some parts fall off so these are blend words like brunch is a blend of
 breakfast and lunch 
 motel is a blend of motor and hotel who here knew that motel was a blend word yeah that word is so old in english that lots of people don 't know that there are parts missing
  you can also make words by changing how they operate this is called functional shift you take a word that acts as one part of speech and you change it into another part of speech  okay who here knew that friend hasn 't always been a verb
 it almost any word in english can be verbed 
 you can also take adjectives and make them into nouns commercial used to be an adjective and now it 's a noun and of course you can green things 
 another way to make words in english is 
 you can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit  so for example in
  another way to make words in english is to take the first letters of something and squish them together so national aeronautics and space administration becomes nasa  and of course you can do this with anything 
  doesn 't matter how silly the words are they can be really good words of english absquatulate is a perfectly good word of english mugwump
 is a perfectly good word of english so the words don 't have have to sound normal they can sound really silly
