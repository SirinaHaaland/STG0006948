  so if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up
 your reputation what would you say 
 how would people describe your judgment your knowledge your behaviors in different situations today i 'd like to explore with you why
  the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset 
 i 'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation 
 sebastian sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on airbnb
  since two thousand and eight  
 i caught up with him recently  where over the course of several cups of tea he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life  more than 
  fifty people have come to stay in the 18th century watchhouse he lives in with his cat  squeak 
  and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition he got a cat  
 and so sebastian bought squeak to protect his reputation  now  as many of you know airbnb is a peer to peer marketplace that matches
 people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over one hundred and ninety two countries  the places being rented
  things that you might expect like spare rooms and holiday homes  but part of the magic is the unique places that you can now access  
 treehouses  teepees  airplane hangars
 igloos if you don 't like the hotel there 's a castle down the road that you can rent for five thousand dollars a night  
 it 's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before 
 now let me show you these heat maps of paris to
  see how insanely fast it 's growing  this image here is from two thousand and eight  the pink dots represent host properties 
 even four years ago  letting strangers stay in your home seemed like a crazy idea  
 now the same view in two thousand and ten  and now two thousand and twelve 
  an airbnb host on almost every main street in paris 
 now what 's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value 
 of all kinds of assets from skills to spaces to material possessions in ways and on a scale never possible before 
 they 're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets  
 but the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like airbnb isn 't the inventory or the money  
 it 's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers 
 this side of airbnb really hit home to sebastian last summer during the
 he woke up around nine  and he checked his email and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him if he was okay  former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street and wanted to check if he needed anything  
 sebastian actually said to me he said thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother
  this little anecdote
 gets to the heart of why i 'm really passionate about collaborative consumption and why after i finished my book  i decided i 'm going to try and spread this into a global movement 
 because at its core  it 's about empowerment  it 's about empowering people to make meaningful connections connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we 've lost somewhere along the way 
  engaging in marketplaces like airbnb like kickstarter like etsy that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions  
 now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard wired in all of us they 're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the facebook age we
 're literally beginning to realize
 that we have wired our world to share swap  rent barter or trade just about anything 
 we 're sharing our cars on whipcar our bikes on spinlister our offices on loosecubes our gardens on landshare we 're lending and borrowing money from strangers on zopa and lending club we are trading lessons on everything
  to coding on skillshare  and we 're even sharing our pets on dogvacay  
 now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption that 's enabling us to match wants with haves in more democratic ways  
 now  collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand  
 but it 's also a part of a massive value shift underway  where instead of consuming to keep up with the joneses
  people are consuming to get to know the joneses  
 but the key reason why it 's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency
  and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier 
  of these marketplaces and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients let me give you an example meet
  chris mok who has i bet the best job title here of superrabbit  now  
 four years ago  chris lost his job unfortunately as an art buyer at macy 's 
 and like so many people he struggled to find a new one during the recession  
 and then he happened to stumble across a post about
  taskrabbit  now the story behind taskrabbit starts like so many great stories with a very cute dog by the name of kobe  
 now what happened was in february two thousand and eight  leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them out for dinner  
 when kobe came trotting up to them and he was salivating with
  they realized they 'd run out of dog food  kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow  now later that evening the 
  tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of ebay for errands existed  six months later  leah quit her job  and taskrabbit was born 
 at the time she didn 't realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking it
  essentially about how we use our online relationships to get things done in the real world  
 now the way taskrabbit works is people outsource the tasks that they want doing 
 name the price they 're willing to pay  and then vetted rabbits bid to run the errand  yes there 's actually a 
 rigorous interview process that 's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy
  rabbits now there 's over four thousand rabbits
 across the united states and five thousand more on the waiting list  
 now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs
  i actually learned the other day that twelve and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through taskrabbit
  i love that the number one task posted over a hundred times a day is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing  
 yes  assembling ikea furniture it
 's brilliant now we may laugh but chris here is actually making up to five thousand dollars a month running errands around his life
 and seventy percent of this new labor force were previously unemployed or underemployed  
 i think taskrabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids they 're just brilliant
  now  
 when you think about it  it 's amazing right that over the past twenty years we 've evolved from trusting people online to share information to
  trusting to handing over our credit card information 
 and now we 're entering the third trust wave connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people powered marketplaces i
 actually came across this fascinating study by the pew center this week that revealed that an active facebook user is three times as likely as
  to believe that most people are trustworthy virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face 
 now with all of my optimism  and i am an optimist  comes a healthy dose of caution or rather an urgent need to address some pressing 
 complex questions 
 how to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world
  do we want them to be the same 
 how do we mimic the way trust is built face to face online how do we stop people who 've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise 
 in a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan or the rate of a mortgage 
 marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers
 need some kind of device to let you know that sebastian and chris are good eggs
  and that device is reputation reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you 
 let 's just take a look at chris you can see that over two hundred people have given him an average rating over four point nine nine out of five  there are over twenty pages of reviews of his work describing him as super friendly and
  and he 's reached level twenty five the highest level making him a superrabbit  now 
 i love that word superrabbit  and interestingly what chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge 
 in other words for superrabbits reputation has a real world value 
 now i know what you might be thinking well this isn 't anything new just think of power sellers on ebay or star ratings on amazon
 the difference today is that with every trade we make comment we leave person we flag  
 badge we earn we leave a reputation trail of how well we can and can 't be trusted  
 and it 's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering  just consider this 
 five million nights have been booked on airbnb in the past six months alone
  million rides have been shared on
 this year  two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer to peer lending platforms this adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data on how well we behave or misbehave  
 now  capturing and correlating the trails of information that we leave in different places
 is a massive challenge but one we 're being asked to figure out
 what the likes of sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is shouldn 't they own their reputation data 
 shouldn 't the reputation that he 's personally invested on building on airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another 
 what i mean by this is say he started selling second hand books on amazon why should he
  have to start from scratch
  it 's a bit like when i moved from new york to sydney it was ridiculous i couldn 't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history
 didn 't travel with me  i was essentially a ghost in the system  
 now i 'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score people 's
  wants to do that 
 i also want to be clear that this isn 't about adding up tweets and likes and friends in a clout like fashion those guys are measuring influence not behaviors that indicate our trustworthiness  
 but the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual 
 just because sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble ikea furniture  
 the big challenge is
  figuring out what data makes sense to pull because the future 's going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation not a single algorithm  
 it 's only a matter of time before we 'll be able to perform a facebook or google like search and see a complete picture of someone 's behaviors in different contexts over time  
 i envision a realtime stream
 of who has trusted you when where and why your reliability on taskrabbit your cleanliness as a guest on airbnb the knowledge that you display on quora or [ unclear ] they 'll all live together in one place 
 and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your
  now this is a concept that i 'm currently researching and writing my next book on and currently define
 as the worth of your reputation your intentions capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces 
 this isn 't some far off frontier  there are actually a wave of startups like connect me and legit and trustcloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate  monitor and use your online reputation
  i realize that this concept may sound
 a little big brother to some of you and yes  there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve 
 but ultimately if we can collect our personal reputation we can actually control it more and extract the immense value that will flow from it
 also more so than our credit history we can actually shape our reputation
  just think of sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his now
 privacy issues aside the other really interesting issue i 'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts 
 people [ who ] for whatever reason are not active online but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world 
 how do we take their contributions to
  their jobs their communities and their families and convert that value into reputation capital  
 ultimately  when we get it right reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power trust and influence 
 a three digit score  your traditional credit history that only thirty percent of us actually know what it is 
 will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost
  what we can access
  in many instances  limit what we can do in the world  
 indeed reputation is a currency that i believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century 
 reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me  
 now the interesting thing is reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption
 work and scale  but the sources it will be generated from and its applications are far bigger than this space alone
  let me give you one example from the world of recruiting where reputation data will make the rsum seem like
 an archaic relic of the past 
  joel spolsky and jeff atwood  decided to start something called stack overflow  
 now  stack overflow is basically a platform where experienced programmers can ask
 other good programmers highly detailed technical questions on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions 
 this site receives five and a half thousand questions a day
 and eighty percent of these receive accurate answers  now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways but it 's basically by convincing their peers
 they know what they 're talking about now a few months after this site launched the founders heard about something interesting  and it actually didn 't surprise them 
 what they heard was that users were putting their reputation scores on the top of
 and that recruiters were searching the platform to find people with unique talents  
 now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way because stack overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves  and what their peers think of them  
 but the bigger principle of what 's happening behind stack overflow i think is incredibly exciting
  people are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built you know
 it 's very interesting when you talk to super users whether that 's superrabbits or
 super people on stack overflow or uberhosts they all talk about how having a high reputation
 unlocks a sense of their own power
 on stack overflow it creates a level playing field enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top on airbnb the people often become more important than the spaces 
 on taskrabbit  it gives people control of their economic activity now at
 the end of my tea with sebastian he told me how on a bad rainy day
  when he hasn 't had a customer in his bookstore he thinks of all the people around the world who 've said something wonderful about him 
 and what that says about him as a person 
 he 's turning fifty this year  and he 's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he 's built on airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life
  the reputation they generate
