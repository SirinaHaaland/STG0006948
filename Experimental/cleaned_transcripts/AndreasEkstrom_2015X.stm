  so whenever i visit a school and talk to students i always ask them the same thing 
 why do you google why is google the search engine of choice for you  
  always get the same three answers one because it works which is a great answer that 's why i 
 somebody will say i really don 't know of any alternatives 
 it 's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually try to google the word ' search engine ' you may find a couple of interesting alternatives 
 and last but not least thirdly  inevitably one student will raise her or his
  with google i 'm certain to always get the best unbiased search result certain
 to always get the best  unbiased search result  
 now as a man of the humanities albeit a digital humanities man that just makes my skin curl even if i too realize that that trust that 
 idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of google
 i will show you
 why that philosophically is almost an impossibility  but let me first elaborate just a little bit on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget 
 so whenever you set out to google something start by asking yourself this am i looking for an isolated fact what is the capital
  what are the building blocks of a water molecule great google away 
 there 's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving that it 's actually london and h30 you don 't see a big conspiracy among those things we agree on a global scale  what the answers are to these isolated facts 
 but if you complicate your question just a little bit
 and ask something like why is there an
  not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore you 're looking for knowledge  
 which is something way more complicated and delicate  
 and to get to knowledge  you have to bring ten or twenty or one hundred facts to the table and acknowledge them and say yes these are all true but because of who i am  young 
  or old black or white gay or straight i will value them differently  and i will say yes this is true but this is more important to me than that 
  human this is when we start to argue 
 to form society  and to really get somewhere we need to filter all our facts here  through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines to finally be 
  grounded in real knowledge  which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve 
  i promised you an example
 just to show you why it 's so hard to get to the point of true  clean objective knowledge as as food for thought i will conduct a
 couple of simple queries search queries we 'll start with michelle
 obama the first lady of the united states and we 'll click for pictures it works really well as
  's a
 perfect search result more or less it 's just her in the picture not even the president 
 how does this work 
 quite simple 
 google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this but quite simply they look at two things more than anything first what does it say in the caption
 under the picture on each website does it say michelle obama under the picture pretty good indication it 's actually her on there second google looks at the picture file the name of the file as such
 uploaded to the website  again is it called 
 pretty good indication it 's not clint eastwood in the picture so you 've got those two and you get a search result like this almost 
 now in two thousand and nine michelle obama was the victim of a racist campaign 
 where people set out to insult her through her search results 
 there was a picture distributed
  widely over the internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey  and that picture was published all over and people published it
 very very purposefully to get it up there in the search results they made sure to write michelle obama in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as 
  or the like you get why to manipulate the search result and it worked
  michelle obama in two thousand and nine that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results  
 now the results are self cleansing and that 's sort of the beauty of it because google measures relevance every every hour every day  
 however google didn 't settle for that this time they just thought that 's racist and it 's a bad search result and we 're going to go back and clean that up manually we are going to write some code and fix it
 which they did and i don 't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea me neither  
 but then a couple of years go by and the world 's
  a terrorist blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in oslo norway and then he traveled to the island of utya and shot and killed
 a group of kids  almost eighty people died that day  and a lot of people would describe this act of terror as
 two steps that he did two things
  he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids it 's not true  
 it was three steps he blew up those buildings he shot those kids and he sat down and waited for the world to google him 
 and he prepared all three steps equally well  
 and if there was somebody who immediately understood this it was a swedish web developer a search engine optimization expert in stockholm named nikke lindqvist he 's also a
 political guy and he was right out there in social media on his blog and facebook and he told everybody if there 's something that this guy wants right now it 's to control the image of himself 
 let 's see if we can distort that 
 let 's see if we in the civilized world can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results and how 
 he told all of his readers
  go out there on the internet find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks
 find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks publish them
 in your feeds on your websites on your blogs  make sure to write the terrorist 's name in the caption make sure to name the picture file breivik jpeg let 
  's teach google that that 's the face of the terrorist 
 and it worked two years after that campaign against michelle
 this manipulation campaign against anders behring breivik worked if you picture googled for him weeks after the july twenty two events from sweden you 'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results 
 as a little protest  
 strangely enough google didn 't intervene this time  they did not step in
 and manually clean those search results up
 so the million dollar question is there anything different
 between these two happenings here is there anything different between what happened to michelle obama and what happened to anders behring breivik 
 of course not it 's the exact same thing  yet google intervened in one case and not in the other why 
  because michelle obama is an honorable person that 's why and anders behring breivik is a despicable person 
 see what happens there an evaluation of a person takes place and there 's only one power player in 
  the world
 with the authority to say who 's who we like you we dislike you we believe in you we don 't believe in you  you 're right you 're wrong you 're true you 're false  you 're obama 
  that 's power if i ever saw it
 so i 'm asking you to remember
 that behind every algorithm is always a person 
 a person with a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate and my message goes out not only to google but to all believers in the faith of code around the world you need to identify your own personal
  you need to understand that you are human and take responsibility accordingly  
 and i say this because i believe we 've reached a point in time when it 's absolutely imperative that we tie those bonds together again  tighter the humanities and the technology  
 tighter than ever and if nothing else to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased clean search result
 is and is likely to remain a myth  thank you for your time
