  or share with you a breakthrough new approach for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse
  hundreds of mobile robots  sometimes thousands of mobile robots moving around a warehouse and i 'll get to the solution  but for a moment just think about the last time that you ordered something online  
 you were sitting on your couch
 and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t shirt so click you put it into your shopping cart
  and then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too click  and maybe a blue pair of shoes click
  so at this point you 've assembled your order  you didn 't stop to think for a moment that that might not be a great outfit  but you hit submit order 
 and two days later this package shows up on your doorstep and you open the box and you 're like wow there 's my goo  
 did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse  
 so i 'm here to tell you it 's that guy right there
 so deep in the middle of that
 that picture you see a classic pick pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting  
 classically these pick workers will spend sixty or seventy percent of their day wandering around the warehouse they 'll often walk as much as five or ten miles in pursuit of those items of
  not only is this an unproductive way to fill
 orders it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders  
 so let me tell you where i first bumped into this problem  i was out in the bay area in ' ninety nine two thousand the dot com boom  
 i worked for a fabulously spectacular flame out called webvan 
 this company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online  and it really came
  down to the fact that we couldn 't do it cost effectively turns out e commerce was something that was very hard and very costly 
 in this particular instance we were trying to assemble thirty items of inventory into a few totes  onto a van to deliver to the home  
 and when you think about it it was costing us thirty dollars imagine we had an eighty nine
 can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that
 and that 's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home  
 so long story short during my one year at webvan what i realized by talking to all the material handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve 
 each base picking red item  green blue  getting those three things in a box 
  goo to retail stores of course webvan
 went out of business and about a year and a half later  i was still noodling on this problem it was still nagging at me and i started thinking about it again and i said  let me just focus briefly 
 on what i wanted as a pick worker or my vision for how it should work
  let 's focus on the problem  i have an order here
 and what i want to do is i want to put red green and blue in this box right here what i need is a system where i put out my hand and poof  the product shows up and i pack it into the order 
  and now we 're thinking this would be a very  operator centric approach to solving the problem  this is what i need what technology is available to solve this problem
  making the pick worker the center of the problem  and providing them the tools to make them as as productive as possible  
 so how did i arrive at this notion well actually it came from a brainstorming exercise  probably a technique that many of you use 
 it 's this notion of testing your ideas take a blank sheet of course  but then test your ideas
  in this particular case we challenged ourselves with the idea  what if we had to build a distribution center in china  where it 's a very very  low cost market  and say  
 labor is cheap  land is cheap
 and we said specifically what if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a 
  distribution center so naturally that led to ideas that said let 's put lots of people in the warehouse and i said hold on zero dollars per hour what i
  would do is ' hire 
  ' ten thousand workers to come to the warehouse every morning at eight a m walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there  
 so you hold captain crunch you hold the mountain dew  you hold the diet coke if i need it i 'll call you otherwise just stand there  but when i need diet coke and i call it you guys talk
  diet coke walks up to the front pick it put it in the tote  away it goes wow  what if the products could walk and talk on their own that 's a very interesting very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse  
 so of course  labor isn 't free on that practical that practical versus awesome spectrum 
 laughter so we said mobile shelving we 'll put them on mobile shelving
  got underway on that and then i 'm sitting on my couch in two thousand and eight  did any of you see the beijing olympics the opening ceremonies  i about fell out of my couch when i saw this i 'm like that was the idea we 'll
 put thousands of people on the warehouse floor the stadium
  interestingly enough this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful impressive digital art all without computers 
 i 'm told it was all peer to peer coordination and communication you stand up i 'll squat down and they made some fabulous art  it speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other 
  the journey so of course now what became the practical reality of this idea  here is a warehouse it 's a pick pack and ship center that has about ten thousand different 
  call them red pens green pens yellow  post it notes  
 we send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods and we deliver them to the side of the building so all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter 
 and the game here is to pick up the shelves  take them down the highway and deliver them
  straight to the pick worker  this pick worker 's life is completely different rather than wandering around the warehouse  she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her 
 so the process is very  is very productive  reach in pick an item  scan the bar code  pack it out by the time you turn around there 's another product there ready to be picked and
  so what we 've done is take out all of the non value added walking searching wasting  waited time and we 've developed
 a very   high fidelity way to pick these orders where you point at it with a laser  scan the upc barcode  and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into so more productive more accurate
 and it turns out it 's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers
  they actually complete the whole order so they do red green and blue not just a part of the order  and they feel a little bit more in control of their environment so
 the side effects of this approach are what really surprised us we knew it was going to be more productive  but we didn 't realize just how pervasive
 this way of thinking
 extended to other functions in the warehouse
  what effectively this approach is doing inside of the dc is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine so this is again 
  of ideas here 's a warehouse  and we 're thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures the
 notion here is that you have ten workers on the right side of the screen
  pick workers if the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom  it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers  contrast that for a moment 
 with the traditional method of using a conveyor when one person passes the order to you you put something in and pass it downstream  everyone has to be in place for that serial process to
  this becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse and then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we 're tracking the popularity of the products and we 're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to
 tune the floor of the warehouse  so what you see here
 potentially
 the week leading up to valentine 's day all that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations
  come in two days after valentine 's day and that candy  the leftover candy has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there 
 one other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale
 to ginormous so
 whether you 're doing two pick
  twenty pick stations or two hundred pick stations the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work in this example you see 
  that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that 's where the pick stations were 
 they sorted it out for themselves so i 'll conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick worker 's actual
  so as we mentioned  the process is to move inventory along the highway and then find your way into these pick stations  
 and our software in the background understands what 's going on in each station  we direct the pods across the highway and we 're attempting to get into a queuing system
 to present the work to the pick worker what 's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers the faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few
  this pick worker now is literally having that experience that we described before she puts out her hand  the product jumps into it or she has to reach in and get it
  she scans it and she puts it in the bucket and all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes  so she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job  never has any idle time never has to leave her mat
 not only a more productive and more accurate
 way to fill orders  we think it 's a more fulfilling way to fill orders  the reason we can say that though is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the kiva zone that day  
 and sometimes we 'll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as they have more energy after the
  with their grandchildren  or in one case a guy said  the kiva zone is so stress free that i 've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication 
 that was at a pharmaceutical distributor so they told us not to use that video 
 so what i wanted to leave you with today is the notion that that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their
  own interesting
 processes and  productivities can emerge
 and now i think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online  you break it open and the goo is in there you 'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order
