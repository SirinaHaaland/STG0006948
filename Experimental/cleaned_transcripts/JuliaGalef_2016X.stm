  i 'd like you to imagine for a moment that you 're a soldier in the heat of battle 
 maybe you 're a roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you 're a zulu warrior  
 regardless of your time and place there are some things that are constant your adrenaline is elevated
 and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes  reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy  
 so now i 'd like you to imagine playing a very different role that of the scout 
 the scout 's job is not to attack or defend the scout 's job is to understand 
 the scout
 is the one going out mapping the terrain  identifying potential obstacles 
 and the scout may hope to learn that say there 's a bridge in a convenient location across a river  
 but above all the scout wants to know what 's really there as accurately as possible 
 and in a real  actual army  both the soldier and the scout are essential  but you can also think of each of these roles
  as
 a mindset
 a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives
 what i 'm going to argue today is that having good judgment  making accurate predictions  making good decisions 
 is mostly about which mindset you 're in
 to illustrate these mindsets in action i 'm going to take you back to
  where this innocuous looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history it was discovered in 
 by officers in the french general staff
 it was torn up in a wastepaper basket  but when they pieced it back together  
 they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to germany 
 so they launched a big investigation
  suspicions quickly converged on this man alfred dreyfus 
 he had a sterling record  no past history of wrongdoing  no motive as far as they could tell  
 but dreyfus was the only jewish officer at that rank in the army  and unfortunately at this time the french army was highly 
 they compared dreyfus 's handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match
  even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity but never mind that 
 they went and searched dreyfus 's apartment  looking for any signs of espionage  they went through his files  
 and they didn 't find anything  this just convinced them more that dreyfus was not only guilty but sneaky as well  because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it 
 next  they went and looked through his personal history for
  any incriminating details  they talked to his teachers they found that he had studied foreign languages in school 
 which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments
 later in life his teachers also said that dreyfus 
  known for having a good memory which was highly suspicious right
  a spy has to remember a lot of things so the case went to trial  and dreyfus was found guilty
 afterwards they took him out into this public square
 and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two this was called the degradation of dreyfus  
 and they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named devil 's island which is this barren rock off the coast of south america  so there he
  went and there he spent his days alone  writing letters and letters to the french government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence 
 but for the most part france considered the matter closed
 one thing that 's really interesting to me about the dreyfus affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that dreyfus was guilty i
 mean you might even assume that
  that they were setting him up that they were intentionally framing him
 but historians don 't think that 's what happened as far as we can tell the officers genuinely believed that the case against dreyfus was strong which
 makes you wonder  what does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man 
  this is a case of what scientists call motivated reasoning it 's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations our desires and fears  shape the way we interpret information
 some information some ideas feel like our allies we want them to win we want to defend them 
 and other information or ideas are the enemy  and we want to shoot them down  
 so this is why i call motivated reasoning
  you have never persecuted a french jewish officer for high treason i assume
  but maybe you 've followed sports or politics so you might have noticed that
 when the referee judges that your team committed a foul for example you 're highly motivated to find reasons why he 's wrong  but if he judges
  that the other team committed a foul awesome that 's a good call let 's not examine it too closely 
 or maybe you 've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy like capital punishment 
 and as researchers have demonstrated if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it 's not effective
  then you 're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed  
 but if it shows that capital punishment works it 's a good study and vice versa if you don 't support capital punishment same thing
 our judgment is strongly influenced  unconsciously  by which side we want to win and this is ubiquitous this shapes
 how we think about our health our relationships how we decide how to vote  what we consider fair or ethical
 what 's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset is how unconscious it is we can think we 're being objective and
 fair minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man  
 however fortunately for dreyfus his story is not over 
 this is colonel picquart he 's another high ranking officer in the french army  and like most people he assumed dreyfus was guilty 
 also like most people in the army he was at least casually anti semitic 
 but
  what if we 're all wrong about dreyfus what happened was he had discovered evidence that the spying for germany had continued  even after dreyfus was in prison 
 and he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo much closer than dreyfus 's handwriting 
 so he brought these discoveries to his superiors
  to his dismay  they either didn 't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings like 
 well  all you 've really shown picquart is that there 's another spy who learned how to mimic dreyfus 's handwriting and he picked up the torch of spying after dreyfus left  
 but dreyfus is still guilty 
 eventually picquart managed to get dreyfus
  but it took him ten years  and for part of that time he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army 
 a lot of people feel like picquart can 't really be the hero of this story
 because he was an anti semite and that 's bad  which i agree with  but personally for me the fact that picquart was anti semitic
 actually makes his actions
  because he had the same prejudices the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it
 trumped all of that
  so to me  picquart is a poster child for what i call scout mindset 
 it 's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose  but just to see what 's really there as as honestly and accurately as you can even if it 's not
 pretty or convenient or pleasant
 this mindset is what i 'm personally passionate about and i 've spent the last few years
 examining and and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset why are some people  sometimes at least able to cut through their own prejudices 
  and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can
  emotional so just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like
 defensiveness or tribalism 
 scout mindset is too it 's just rooted in different emotions
 for example  scouts are curious  they 're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new
  itch to solve a puzzle
 they 're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that that contradicts their expectations  
 scouts also have different values  they 're more likely to say
 they think it 's virtuous to test your own beliefs  and they 're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak 
 and above all scouts are grounded which means
  as a person isn 't tied
 to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic  
 so they can believe that capital punishment works if studies come out showing that it doesn 't they can say huh looks like i might be wrong 
 doesn 't mean i 'm bad or stupid
  this cluster of traits is what researchers have found and i 've also found anecdotally
  and the key takeaway i want to leave you with about those traits is that
 they 're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know
 in fact they don 't correlate very much with iq at all they 're about how you feel
 there 's a quote that i keep coming back to  by saint exupry he 's the author of the little prince he said if you want to build
  don 't drum up your men to collect wood and and give orders and distribute the work 
 instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea 
 in other words  i claim 
 if we really want to improve our judgment as as individuals and as societies what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric
  probability or economics even though those things are quite valuable
 but what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset  we need to change the way we feel 
 we need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something 
 we need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts
  the question i want to leave you with is what do you most yearn for 
 do you yearn to defend your own beliefs or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can thank you
