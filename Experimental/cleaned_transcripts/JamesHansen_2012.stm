  that would cause me a reticent midwestern scientist to get myself arrested
 in front of the white house protesting  and what would you do if you knew what i know let 's start with how i
  got to this point i was lucky to grow up at a time
 when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university and i was really lucky
 to go to the university of iowa where i could study under professor james van allen
 who built instruments for the first u s satellites professor van allen
  told me about observations of venus 
 that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that venus had an ionosphere or was venus extremely hot 
 the right answer  confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft was that venus was
  very hot
 nine hundred degrees fahrenheit and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere 
 i was fortunate to join nasa and successfully propose an experiment to fly to venus 
 our instrument took this image of the veil of venus  which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid  
 but while our instrument was being built i became involved in calculations
  of the greenhouse effect
 here on earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing  
 eventually  i resigned as principal investigator
 on our venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important its changes will affect all of humanity 
 the greenhouse effect had been well understood
  for more than a century  british physicist john tyndall in the one thousand eight hundred and fifty 's made laboratory measurements
 of the infrared radiation  which is heat  and he showed that gasses such as co2 absorb heat  thus acting like a blanket
 warming earth 's surface  
  we published an article in science magazine concluding that observed warming of zero point four degrees celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing co2 
 that earth would likely warm in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century
  we also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in north america and asia  erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled northwest passage 
 all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under
  that paper was reported on the front page of the new york times and led to me testifying to congress in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's 
 testimony in which i emphasized that global warming increases both extremes
 of the earth 's water cycle 
 heatwaves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming  
 but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more
  events  there will be stronger storms and greater flooding global warming hoopla
 became time consuming and distracted me from doing science
 partly because i had complained that the white house altered my testimony 
 so i decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others 
  fifteen years later evidence of global warming was much stronger most of the things mentioned in our one thousand nine hundred and eighty one paper
 were facts i had the privilege to speak twice
 to the president 's climate task force  but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels 
 by then we had two grandchildren
  and connor i decided that i did not want them in the future to say opa understood what was happening but he didn 't make it clear 
 so i decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy  i gave the talk at the university of iowa in two thousand and four and at the two thousand and five
 meeting of the american geophysical union this
  led to calls from the white house to nasa headquarters and i was told that i could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by nasa headquarters 
 after i informed the new york times about these restrictions nasa was forced to end the censorship  but there were
  i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks 
 soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted
 never to appear again over the next few years i was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency
 of a change in energy
  while still researching the physics of climate change  let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from earth 's energy balance
 and second from earth 's climate history  
 adding co2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed  it reduces earth 's heat radiation
 to space so there 's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out
 earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the sun 
 so the key quantity is earth 's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in
 than going out if so more warming
 is in the pipeline it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses now finally we can measure earth 's energy
 imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in earth 's heat reservoirs  
 the biggest reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until more than three thousand argo floats
 were distributed around the world 's ocean 
 these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate  the deep ocean is also gaining
  heat at a smaller rate and energy is
 going into the net melting of ice all around the planet  and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming  the total energy imbalance 
 now is about six tenths of a watt per square meter 
  when added up over the whole world it 's enormous  it 's about twenty times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity it
 's equivalent to exploding four hundred thousand hiroshima atomic bombs per day three hundred and sixty five days per year 
 that 's how much extra energy earth is gaining each day this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we
  must reduce co2 from three hundred and ninety one ppm parts per million back to three hundred and fifty ppm  
 that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming 
 climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum
  in the record  when the sun 's energy reaching earth was least  
 yet  there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun 's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses mainly from burning fossil fuels 
 now consider earth 's climate history 
  these curves for global temperature atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year
 over eight hundred thousand years forming a two mile thick ice sheet 
 as you see there 's a high correlation between temperature co2 and sea level careful examination shows that the
  by a few centuries 
 climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes co2 to change not vice versa 
 but that lag is exactly what is expected  
 small changes in earth 's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the
  distribution of sunlight on earth when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt  shrinking ice sheets
 make the planet darker  so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer 
 a warmer ocean releases co2 just as a warm coca cola does
  ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing 
 the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today 
 the physics does not change as earth warms now
  because of extra co2 we put in the atmosphere ice will melt  and co2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost  while we can 't say
 exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur it is certain they will occur  unless we stop the warming 
 there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning
  precise measurements by grace the gravity satellite reveal that both greenland and antarctica
 are now losing mass  several hundred cubic kilometers per year and the rate has accelerated
 since the measurements began nine years ago  methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise
  can we look forward to 
 the last time co2 was three hundred and ninety ppm today 's value  sea level was higher by at least fifteen meters fifty feet  
 where you are sitting now would be under water 
 most estimates are that this century we will get at least one meter  i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil
  fuels perhaps even five meters which is eighteen feet this century or shortly thereafter  
 the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity 's control 
 ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries  there would be no stable shoreline  
 the economic consequences are almost unthinkable hundreds of new
 devastations around the world 
 what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species 
 the monarch butterfly could be one of the twenty to fifty percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change
 estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on
 business as usual fossil fuel use 
 global warming is already affecting people 
 the texas oklahoma  mexico heatwave and drought last year moscow the year before
 and europe in two thousand and three were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm 
 fifty years ago
  covered only two to three tenths of one percent of the land area in recent years 
 because of global warming they now cover about ten percent
 an increase by a factor of twenty five to fifty so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe texas and moscow heatwaves were not
  they were caused by global warming 
 an important impact  if global warming continues will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world  the midwest and great plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts 
 worse than the dust bowl within just a few decades  if we let global warming continue 
 how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in
  ten countries  getting arrested burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over thirty years 
 more grandchildren helped me along 
 jake is a super positive enthusiastic boy  here at age two and a half years he thinks he can protect his two and a
  leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control 
 now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it
 with a simple honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed one hundred percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis
 with the government not keeping one dime 
 most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they 'd pay in increased prices  this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy
 and innovations  creating millions of jobs  it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly
 to a clean energy future
  several top economists are coauthors on this proposition  
 jim dipeso of republicans for environmental protection describes it thusly transparent market based does not enlarge government  leaves energy 
  decisions to individual choices  sounds like a conservative climate plan 
  to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments
 are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by four hundred to five hundred billion dollars per year worldwide  
 thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal longwall mining fracking tar sands tar shale deep ocean
  ocean arctic drilling  
 this path if continued  
 guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations a large fraction of species will be committed to extinction 
 and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world causing massive famines
  and economic decline  imagine
 a giant asteroid
 on a direct collision course with earth that is the equivalent
 of what we face now yet we dither  taking no action to divert
 the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it
  becomes 
 if we had started in two thousand and five it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century 
 if we start next year  it is six percent per year 
 if we wait ten years  it is fifteen percent per year extremely difficult and expensive perhaps impossible 
 but we aren 't even
  starting  
 so now you know what i know that is moving me to sound this alarm  
 clearly i haven 't gotten this message across  the science is clear  
 i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions
 more effectively we owe it to our children and grandchildren  thank you
