  i was on a sabbatical  and i returned to the medical university where i studied i saw real patients and i wore
 the white coat for the first time in seventeen years in fact since i became a management consultant
  there were two things that surprised me during the month i spent 
 the first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting 
 and the second thing which really bothered me actually was that several of the colleagues i met  former friends from medical school 
 who i knew to be some of the smartest most motivated engaged and passionate
 people i 'd ever met
  many of them had turned cynical disengaged  or had distanced themselves from hospital management 
 so with this focus on cost cutting i asked myself are we forgetting the patient 
 many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of
  it 's a big part of the national budgets and many different reforms aim at holding back this growth 
 in some countries we have long waiting times for patients for surgery 
 in other countries new drugs are not being reimbursed and therefore don 't reach patients 
 in several countries  doctors and nurses are the targets to some extent for the governments after all the costly decisions
 in health care are taken by doctors and nurses
  you choose an expensive lab test  you choose to operate on an old and frail patient 
 so by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians this is a way to hold costs down 
 and ultimately some physicians will say today that they don 't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients  
 so no wonder that some of my old colleagues are
  frustrated 
 at bcg we looked at this and we asked ourselves this can 't be the right way of managing healthcare  
 and so we took a step back
 and we said what is it that we are trying to achieve ultimately in the healthcare system  we 're aiming at improving health
  for the patients 
 and we need to do so at a limited or affordable cost we call this value based healthcare 
 on the screen behind me you see what we mean by value 
 outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend 
 this was described beautifully in a book in two thousand and six by michael porter and elizabeth teisberg on this
  surrounded by his three beautiful daughters  
 when we started doing our research at bcg  we decided not to look so much at the costs but to look at the quality instead 
 and in the research one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw 
 you compare hospitals in a country you 'll find some that are extremely good but you 'll find
  he suffers from prostate cancer  and he probably needs surgery  now living in europe he can choose to go to germany that has a 
 healthcare system if he goes there and goes to the average hospital he will have the risk of becoming incontinent
 by about fifty percent so he would have to start wearing diapers
  again  you flip a coin  fifty percent risk that 's quite a lot 
 if he instead would go to hamburg  and to a clinic called the martini klinik the risk would be only one in twenty 
 either you a flip a coin or you have a one in twenty risk that 's a huge difference a seven fold difference  
 when we look at many hospitals
 for many different diseases we see these huge
  differences  
 but you and i don 't know  we don 't have the data  and often the data actually doesn 't exist nobody knows  
 so going the hospital is a lottery  
 now it doesn 't have to be that way  there is hope 
 in the late ' 70s there were a group of swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting  and they were discussing
  the different procedures they used
 to operate hip surgery to the left of this slide you see a variety of metal pieces artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip  
 they all realized they had their individual way of operating  they all argued that my technique is the best but none of them actually knew and they admitted that  
  we probably need to measure quality
 so we know and can learn from what 's best 
 so they in fact spent two years debating so what is quality in hip surgery oh
 we should measure this no we should measure that and they finally agreed  and once they had agreed they started measuring 
 and started sharing the data  very quickly they found that if you
  put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in it actually lasted a lot longer 
 and most patients would never have to be  re operated on in their lifetime 
 they published the data  and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country  
 everybody saw this makes a lot of sense since then they publish every year  once a year they publish the league table who 's best who 's at the bottom 
  and they visit each other to try to learn so a continuous cycle of improvement 
 for many years swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world 
 at least for those who actually were measuring and many were not 
 now i found this principle really exciting so the physicians get together they agree on what quality is they start measuring
  they share the data  they find who 's best  and they learn from it continuous improvement  
 now that 's not the only exciting part that 's exciting in itself 
 but if you bring back the cost side of the equation 
 and look at that it turns out those who have focused on quality  they actually also have the lowest costs although that 's not been the purpose in the first place
  so if you look at the hip surgery story again  there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the u s and sweden  
 they looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery 
 in the united states the number was three times higher than in sweden  
 so many unnecessary surgeries  and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year
  period  now you can imagine how much savings there would be for society  we did a study where we looked at oecd data
 does every so often look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries the
 united states has for many diseases  actually a quality which is below the average in
  now if the american healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality and raise quality just to the level of average oecd  it would save the american
 people five hundred billion u s dollars a year that 's twenty percent
 of the budget of the healthcare budget of the country  
  now you may say that these numbers are fantastic and it 's all logical  but is it possible this would be a paradigm shift in healthcare  
 and i would argue that
 not only can it be done  but it has to be done  the agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system in
 my practice as a consultant  i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare
  staff every year  the one thing they have in common is
 they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients physicians are like most of you in the audience very competitive 
 they were always best in class  we were always best in class 
 and if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no
  better than what others do  they will do whatever it takes to improve but most of them don 't know  
 but physicians have another characteristic  they actually thrive from peer recognition 
 if a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results  they will share  
 they will share the information on how to improve
 so it is by measuring and creating transparency you get a cycle of continuous improvement  
 which is what this slide shows  
 now you may say this is a nice idea  but this isn 't only an idea this is happening in reality  
 we 're creating a global
  be able to measure and compare what we achieve 
 together with two academic institutions 
 michael porter at harvard business school  and the karolinska institute in sweden  bcg has formed something we call ichom 
 you may think that 's a sneeze  but it 's not a sneeze it 's an acronym it stands for the international consortium
  we 're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss disease by disease what is really quality what should we measure 
 and to make those standards global 
 they 've worked four working groups have worked during the past year  cataracts back pain  
 coronary artery disease which is for instance  heart attack and prostate cancer
  the four groups will publish their data in november of this year 
 that 's the first time we 'll be comparing apples to apples not only within a country  but between countries  
 next year we 're planning to do eight diseases  
 the year after sixteen in three years ' time we plan to have covered forty percent of the disease burden
  apples to apples who 's better why is that 
 five months ago 
 i led a workshop at the largest university hospital in northern europe  they have a new ceo  and she has a vision 
 i want to manage my big institution much more
  outcomes that matter to patients this particular day  we sat in in a workshop
 together with physicians nurses and other staff discussing leukemia in children 
 the group discussed how do we measure quality today can we measure it better than we do 
 we discussed how do we treat these kids what are important improvements
  and we discussed what are the costs for these patients can we do treatment more efficiently  there was an enormous energy in the room there were so many ideas so much enthusiasm 
 at the end of the meeting  the chairman of the department he stood up 
 he looked over the group and he said
 first he raised his hand i forgot that he raised his hand  clenched his fist and then he said to the group
  we 're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way 
 by measuring value in healthcare that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients  
 we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem
 but an important part of the solution i believe
  measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution and i 'm convinced
 that the founder of modern medicine the greek hippocrates who always put the patient at the center he would smile in his grave  thank you
