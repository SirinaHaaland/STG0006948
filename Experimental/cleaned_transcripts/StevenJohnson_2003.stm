  i want to take you back basically to my hometown and to a picture of my hometown of the week that emergence came out  and it 's a picture we 've seen several times
 i live
 right there in the west village so the plume was luckily blowing west away from us we had a 
 baby in the house that was ours we hadn 't taken it from somebody else
  the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a of a book and a baby  and having this event happen so close
 that my first thought when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building was
 that i 'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i 'd just written because so much of that book was a celebration of the
  potential of density of largely urban density of connecting people and putting them together in one place and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together 
 and it seemed to me looking at that
 that tower burning and then falling those towers burning and falling that in fact one of the lessons here was that density kills  and that of all the technologies that were exploited
 to to make that carnage
 come into being
  probably the single group of technologies that that cost the most lives were those that enable fifty thousand people to live
 in two buildings one hundred and ten stories above the ground
  if they hadn 't been crowded you compare the loss of life at the pentagon to the to the twin towers and you can see that very powerfully  and so i started
  you know density density i 'm not sure if you know this was the right call
  and i kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days  and then about two days later the wind started to change a little bit and you could
 you could sense that the air was not healthy  and so even though there were no cars still
 in the west village where we lived my wife sent me out to buy a you know a large air filter at the bed bath and beyond 
 which was located about twenty blocks away north
  and so i went out and obviously i 'm physically a very strong person as you can tell so i
 wasn 't worried about carrying this thing twenty blocks and i walked out and this really miraculous thing happened to me as i was walking north
 to buy this air filter  which was that the streets were completely alive
  there was an incredible it was you know a beautiful day as it was for about a week after  
 and the west village had never seemed more lively i walked up along hudson street where jane jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what i was writing in emergence
 past the white horse tavern that great old bar where
 dylan thomas drank himself to death and the bleecker street playground was filled with kids and all the people who lived in the
  owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood were all out there had them all open people were out there were no cars so it seemed even better in some ways  and
 it was a beautiful urban day  and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working 
 the city was there all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating they were all on display there
 on those streets  and i
  this is the power of a city i mean the power of the city we talked about cities as being centralized in space but what makes them so strong most of the time is they 're decentralized in function 
 they don 't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail  if they did it probably was right there at ground zero i mean you know the emergency bunker was right there was destroyed by the 
 by the attacks and obviously the the damage done to the building and the lives but nonetheless just twenty blocks north two days later  the city had never looked more
  alive if you 'd gone into the minds of the people well you would have seen a lot of trauma and you would have seen a lot of heartache 
 and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover but the system itself of this city
 was thriving  so i took heart in seeing that so
 i wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works
  so well and how some of those reasons kind of map on
 to where the web is going right now the question that i found myself asking to people when i was talking about the book afterwards is when you 've talked about emergent behavior when you 've talked about collective intelligence  the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask 
 who builds a neighborhood  
 who decides that soho should have this personality and that the latin quarter should have this personality well there are some kind of executive decisions but mostly the answer is everybody and nobody everybody contributes a little bit
 no single person is really the the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood  same thing to the question of who was keeping the streets alive
 post 9 eleven in my neighborhood well it was the whole city the whole system kind of working on it and everybody contributing a small little part  
 and this is increasingly what we 're starting to see on the web
  in a bunch of interesting ways most of which weren 't around actually except in very experimental things when i was writing emergence and when the book came out so it 's been a very
 optimistic time i think and i want to just talk about a few of those things  i think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that 's starting to emerge online right now and the old one
 looked like this this is not the future
 king of england although it looks like it it 's some guy it 's a geocities homepage of some guy that i found
  online who 's interested if you look at the bottom in soccer and jesus and garth brooks and clint beckham and my hometown those are his links  but nothing really says this model of interactivity which was so 
  exciting and captures the the real the web zeitgeist of one thousand nine hundred and ninety five than 
  put up a picture of your dog and link to it and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link  and you know i don 't want to belittle that that in a sense to
 reference
 what jeff was talking about yesterday that was in a sense the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the
 the explosion of interest in the web that you could put up a link and somebody could click on it and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go  but it 's still a very one to one kind of relationship there 's one person
  putting up the link and there 's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not 
 the new model is much more like this and we 've already seen a couple of references to this 
 this is what happens when you search steven johnson on google about two months ago  i had the great breakthrough one of my great kind
  shining achievements which is that my website finally became a top result for steven johnson
  there 's some theoretical physicist at mit named steven johnson who has dropped two spots i 'm happy to say 
 and you know 
 i mean i 'll look at a couple of things like this but google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing  it 's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you
  creating this page obviously and we all know this but it 's worth just thinking about it is not some person deciding that i am the the number one
 answer for steven johnson  
 but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it and google just sitting there and running the numbers
  so there 's this collective decision making that 's going on this page is effectively collectively authored by the web
 and google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place  now they 're more innovative well google 's pretty innovative but there are some new
 twists on this there 's this incredibly interesting new site technorati that 's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these and these are
 looking in the in the blog world and the
  he 's analyzed basically
 all the weblogs out there that he 's tracking and he 's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs  
 and so you have kind of an authority a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it
  and so at any given time on any given page on the web actually you can say what does the weblog community think about this page
 and you can get a list this is what they think about my site it 's ranked by blog authority you can also rank it by the latest posts
 so when i was talking in emergence i talked about the limitations of the one way linking architecture that basically you could link to somebody else but they wouldn 't necessarily know that you were pointing to them 
 and that was one of the reasons why the web wasn 't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two way linking you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things well something like technorati
  what 's interesting here is that this is a quote from dave weinberger where he talks about everything being
 purposive in the web there 's nothing artificial he has this line where he says you know you 're going to
 put up a link there if you see a link somebody decided to put it there and he says the link to one site didn 't just grow on the the other page like a tree fungus 
 and in fact i think that 's not entirely true anymore
 i could put up a feed of all those links
 generated by technorati on the right hand side of my page and they would change as the overall
  ecology of the web changes that little list there would change i wouldn 't really be directly in control of it so it 's much closer in a way to a data fungus in a sense wrapped around that page than
 it is to a deliberate link that i 've placed there  
 now what you 're having here is basically a global brain that you 're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it 's thinking
  and there are all these interesting tools google does the google zeitgeist
 which looks at search requests to test what 's going on what people are interested in and they publish it with lots of fun graphs  
 and i 'm saying a lot of nice things about google so i 'll be i 'll be saying one little critical thing there 's a problem with the google zeitgeist which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for britney spears pictures  
 which is not necessarily news the columbia blows up suddenly there are a lot of searches on columbia well you know we should expect to see that
  's not necessarily something we didn 't know already  so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream
 the question is are you finding out something new and one of the things that i
 experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically  you take an abstract term  and
 you search google for that term  and then you search the results that you get
  back for somebody 's name  
 so basically the number of pages that mention this term  that also mention this page the percentage of those pages is that person 's google share of that term  
 so you can do kind of interesting contests like for instance this is a google share of the ted conference  so
 richard saul wurman has about a fifteen percent google share of the ted conference our good friend chris
 has about a six percent but with a bullet i might add 
 but the interesting thing is you can broaden the search a little bit and it turns out actually that forty two percent is the the mola mola fish i had no idea no that 's not true 
 i made that up because i just wanted to put up a slide of the mola
  i also did and i don 't want to start a little fight in the next panel but i did a google share analysis of evolution and natural selection
  so right here now this is a big category you have smaller percentages so this is zero point seven percent
 dan dennett who 'll be speaking shortly right below him zero point five percent steven pinker  so dennett 's in
  lead a little bit there  but what 's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of of what else is out there so
 gary bauer is not too far behind has slightly different theories about about evolution and natural selection  and right behind him is
 l ron hubbard so 
 you can see we 're in the ascot which is always good and by the way chris that would 've been a really good panel  i think
  hubbard apparently started to reach but besides that i think it would be good next year
  another quick thing this is a slightly different thing but this analysis some of you may have seen it just came out this is bursty words looking at the
 historical record of state of the union addresses  
 so these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere so they 're kind of  you know memes that start taking off that didn 't have a lot of historical precedent before  
 so the first one is
  these are the bursty words around 1860s slaves emancipation slavery rebellion kansas  that 's britney spears i mean you know  ok interesting they 're talking about slavery in one thousand eight hundred and sixty 
 one thousand nine hundred and thirty five relief depression recovery banks and ok i didn 't learn anything new there as well that 's pretty obvious one thousand nine hundred and eighty five right at the center of the reagan years
 that 's
  all have a lot of syllables so you know you can actually download it 's hard to remember those
 but seriously actually what you can see there in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise is reagan reinventing the political language of the country
 and and shifting to a much more intimate much more folksy much more telegenic contracting all those verbs you know twenty years before it was still
  what you can do but with reagan it 's that 's where there 's nancy and i that kind of language  
 and so something we kind of knew but you didn 't actually notice syntactically what he was doing i 'll
 go very quickly the question now and this is the really interesting question is what kind of higher level shape is emerging right now in the overall web ecosystem and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of
 at the cutting edge
  think what happens there will also happen in the wider system now there was a very interesting article by clay shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago  and this is basically the distribution of links
 on the web to all these various different blogs
  it follows a power law so that there are a few extremely well linked to popular blogs and a long tail of blogs with very few links  so twenty percent of the blogs get eighty
  percent of the of the links
  now this is a very interesting thing it 's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man one modem democracy where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard
  and so the question is why is this happening it 's not being imposed by fiat from above it 's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now  
  what 's great about it is that people are working on within seconds of clay publishing this piece people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape 
  would start appearing and basically the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage if you 're the first site there everybody links to you if you 're the second site there  most people link to you and so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future and then you get this kind of
  and so what dave sifry at technorati started working on literally as shirky started
 after he published his piece was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers  and he started looking at interesting newcomers that don 't have a lot of links that suddenly get
 a bunch of links in the last
