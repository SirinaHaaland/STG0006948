  more of it than you think actually  everything i would say everything that matters except every thing
  we can see matter  but we can 't see what 's the matter  as in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently 
 the marriage suffered a setback in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five when the husband was killed by the wife 
 there 's a world of invisibility there isn 't there 
  we can see the stars and the planets but we can 't see what holds them apart or what draws them together 
 with matter as with people we see only the skin of things we can 't see into the engine room we can 't see what makes people tick 
 at least not without difficulty  and the closer we look at anything  
 the more it disappears 
 in fact if you look really closely at stuff if you look at the basic substructure of matter  there isn 't anything there electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz and there is only energy
  't see energy  
 so everything that matters that 's important is invisible 
 one slightly silly thing that 's invisible is this story which is invisible to you  and i 'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds  
 it 's about an m p called geoffrey dickens  
 the late geoffrey dickens m p was attending a fete in his constituency wherever he went at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted
  smiling woman of indescribable ugliness 
 try as he might he couldn 't get away from her 
 a few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him  had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph  after her name written in brackets was the apt description  horse face 
 i 've misjudged this
  not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness she turns it to her advantage 
 a photo is not enough 
 so he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in and on the photograph he wrote with a flourish to horse face with love from geoffrey dickens m p 
 after it had been sent off his secretary said to him did you get that letter from the woman at the fete i wrote horse face on her so you 'd remember
  i bet he thought he wished he was invisible don 't you 
 so one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can 't see we also can 't understand gravity is one thing that we can 't see and which we 
  don 't understand it 's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces and the weakest 
  and nobody really knows what it is or why it 's there for what it 's worth sir isaac newton the greatest scientist who ever lived 
 he thought jesus came to earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity that 's what he thought he was there for 
 so bright guy  could be wrong on that one i don 't know 
 consciousness  i see all your faces  i have no idea what any of you are thinking isn 't that amazing isn 't that incredible that we can 't read each other 's minds but we can
  taste each other perhaps if we get close enough  but we can 't read each other 's minds i find that quite astonishing 
 in the sufi faith this great middle eastern religion which some claim is the route of all religions sufi masters are all telepaths  
 so they say  but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn 't exist  
 so that 's why we don 't think it exists the sufi masters working on us
  question of consciousness
 and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence has really like the study of consciousness gotten nowhere we have no idea how consciousness works 
 with artificial intelligence  not only have they not created artificial intelligence they haven 't yet created artificial stupidity 
  remind you of anyone 
 interesting  
 i 'm as you can guess not a materialist i 'm an immaterialist and i 've found a very useful new word ignostic  okay  i 'm an ignostic  
 i refuse to be drawn on the question of whether god exists  until somebody properly defines the terms 
 another thing we can 't see is the human genome  and this is increasingly
 peculiar because
 about twenty years ago when they started delving into the genome  they thought it would probably contain around one hundred thousand genes geneticists will know this but every year since it 's been revised downwards 
 we now think there are likely to be only just over twenty thousand genes in the human genome this is extraordinary  because rice
  two more than people  and the same as a gorilla 
 you can 't see these things but they are very strange 
 the stars by day i always think that 's fascinating  the universe
  the more light there is the less you can see 
 time 
 nobody can see time i don 't know if you know this modern physics there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn 't really exist because it 's too inconvenient for the figures it 's much 
  easier if if it 's not really there you can 't see the future obviously  and you can 't see the past except in your memory one of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can 't see my son asked me this the other day he said dad can you remember what i was like when i was two and i said
  yes and he said why can 't i isn 't that extraordinary you cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three
 which is great news for psychoanalysts because otherwise they 'd be out of a job because that 's where all the stuff happens 
 that makes you who you are 
 another thing you can 't see is the grid on which we hang this is fascinating  you probably know some of you that
 cells are continually renewed you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff skin flakes off  hairs grow nails that kind of stuff but every cell in your body is replaced at some point  
 taste buds every ten days or so  
 livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer a spine takes several years but at the end of seven years  not one cell in your body
 remains from what was there seven years ago the question is who then
  we what are we what is this thing that we hang on that is actually us  
 okay  
 atoms you can 't see them nobody ever will they 're smaller than the wavelength of light  
 gas you can 't see that interesting somebody mentioned one thousand six hundred recently gas was invented in one thousand six hundred by a dutch chemist called van helmont
  it 's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual  quite good he also invented
 a word called blas meaning astral radiation didn 't catch on unfortunately 
 but well done him 
 there is so many things that light  you can 't see light when it 's dark in a vacuum  if a person shines
  some physicists will disagree with this but it 's odd that you can 't see the beam of light you can only see what it hits  i find that extraordinary not to be able to see light not to be able to see darkness
  electricity you can 't see that don 't let anyone tell you they understand electricity they don 't nobody knows what it is 
 you probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire don 't you at the speed of light when you turn the light on they don 't electrons bumble down the wire about the
  of spreading honey they say 
 galaxies one hundred billion of them estimated in the universe one hundred billion how many can we see five  
 five out of the one hundred billion galaxies with the naked eye and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you 've got very good eyesight 
 radio waves there 's another thing heinrich hertz  when he discovered radio waves
  and
 somebody said to him well what 's the point of these heinrich what 's the point of these radio waves that you 've found and he said well i 've no idea but i guess somebody will find a use for them someday 
 and
 that 's what they do radio that 's what they what they discovered 
 anyway  so the biggest thing that 's invisible to us is what we don 't know it is incredible how little we know  thomas edison
  once said we don 't know one percent of one millionth about anything and i 've come to the conclusion
 because you 've asked this other question what 's another thing you can 't see the point most of us what 's the point 
 you can 't see a point it 's by
  what i 've got it down to is there are only two questions really worth asking why are we here and what should we do about it while we are and
 to help you i 've got two things to leave you with from two great philosophers perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century one a mathematician and an engineer  
 and the other a poet  
 the first is ludwig wittgenstein
 who said i don 't know
 why we are here  but i 'm pretty sure it 's not in order to enjoy ourselves
  i 've no idea
