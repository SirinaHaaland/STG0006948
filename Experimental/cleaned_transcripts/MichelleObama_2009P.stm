  this is my first trip 
 my first foreign trip as a first lady can you believe that 
 and while this is not my first visit
  to the u k i have to say that
 i am glad that this is my first official visit the special relationship between the united states and the u k is based
 not only on the relationship between governments  but the common language and the values that we share  and i 'm reminded of that
 by watching you all today  during my visit i 've
 been especially honored to meet some of britain 's most extraordinary women
 women who are paving the way for all of you  and i 'm honored
 to meet you the future leaders of great britain
 and this world  and although the circumstances of our lives may seem
 very distant with me standing here as the first lady of the
  united states of america and you just getting through school  i want you to know that we have very much in common 
 for nothing in my life 's path
 would have predicted that i 'd be standing here as the first
  first lady of the united states of america there is nothing in my story that would land me here
  wasn 't raised with wealth or resources
 or any social standing to speak of 
 i was raised on the south side of chicago that 's the real part of chicago  
 and i was the product of a working class community my father was a city worker
  all of his life and my mother was a stay at home mom  and she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother
  neither of them attended university 
 my dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life  but even as it got harder for him to walk
 and get dressed in the morning i saw him struggle more and more
 my father never complained about his struggle he was grateful for what he had he just woke
  up a little earlier
 and worked a little harder 
 and my brother and i were raised with all that you really need 
 love strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work 
 that there was nothing that we could not do 
 i am an example of what 's possible
 when girls from the
  of their lives are loved and nurtured
 by the people around them
  i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life
  grandmothers  teachers aunts cousins  neighbors who taught me about
 quiet strength and dignity  and my
  the most important role model in my life who lives with us at the white house
 and helps to care for our two little daughters  malia and sasha
  she 's an active presence in their lives as well as mine and is instilling in them
 the same values that she taught me and my brother  
 things like compassion and integrity  and confidence  and perseverance
 all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love
  that only a grandmother can give  i was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged
 by some strong male role models as well  
 including my father my brother  uncles and grandfathers  the men in my life life taught me some important things as well  
 they taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between
 men and women they taught me about what a strong marriage feels like  that it 's built on faith and commitment
 and an admiration for each other 's unique gifts  they taught me about
 what it means to
 be a father and to raise a family and not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help
 raise
  kids in the broader community and these were the same qualities that i looked for
 in my own husband  barack obama  
 and when we first met  one of the things that i remember is that he took me out on a date
 and his date was to
 go with him to a community
  but when we met barack was a community organizer he worked  helping people to find jobs and
 to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods 
 as he talked to the residents in that community center he talked about two concepts he talked about the world as it is and
  the world as it should be 
 and i talked about this throughout the entire campaign what he said that all too often is that we accept
 the distance between those two ideas  
 and sometimes we settle for the world as it is even when it doesn 't reflect our values and aspirations  
 but barack reminded us on that day all of us in that room that we all know
 what our world should look like
  we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like  we all know 
 and he urged the people in that meeting in that community to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas 
 to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should
  one and the same  and i think about that today because i am
 reminded and convinced that all of you in this school
 are very important parts of closing that gap you are the women who will build the world as it should be 
 you 're going to write the next chapter in history not just for yourselves  but for your generation
 and generations to come  and that 's why
  why getting a good education is so important that 's why all of this that you 're going through
 the ups and the downs  the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don 't
 why it 's so important because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong
 as the health of their women
 and that 's important to keep in mind
 of that health includes an outstanding education  the difference between a struggling family and a healthy one
 is often the presence of an empowered woman
 or women at the center of that family  the difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often
  the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society  
 the difference between a languishing nation
 and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls 
 and this school named after the u k ' s first female doctor 
 and the surrounding buildings named for mexican artist
 frida kahlo  mary seacole
  seacole  the jamaican nurse known as the black
 florence nightingale 
 and the english author  emily bronte  honor women who fought sexism  racism and ignorance to pursue
 their passions to feed their own souls  they allowed for no obstacles as the sign said back there
  other way to live than to follow their dreams  and having done so these women
 moved many obstacles  
 and they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors all of whom have
  and by getting a good education you too can control your own destiny  please remember that 
 if you want to know the reason why i 'm standing here it 's because of education  
 i never cut class  sorry i don 't know if anybody is cutting class  i never did it i loved getting
  i liked being smart  i liked being on time i liked getting my work done i thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world  
 and you too with these same values can control your own destiny you too can pave the way 
 you too can realize your dreams and then
 your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing
  history proves that it doesn 't matter
 whether you come from a council estate or a country estate 
 your success will be determined by your own fortitude 
 your own confidence your own individual hard work that is true that is the reality of the world that we live in 
 you now have control over your own destiny  and it won 't be easy
 that 's for sure
  but you have everything you need everything
 you need to succeed you already have right here my husband works
 in this big office  they call it the oval office in the white house there 's the desk that he sits at it 's called the
  it was built by the timber of her majesty 's ship resolute
 and given by
 queen victoria it 's an enduring symbol of
 the friendship between our two nations  and its name resolute is a reminder of the strength of character that 's required
 not only to lead a country but to live
 a life of purpose
  and i hope in pursuing your dreams  you all remain resolute that you go forward
 without limits  and that you use your talents because there are many we 've seen them it 's there
 that you use them to create the world as it should be because we are counting on you 
 we are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be because the world is big
 and it 's full of challenges and we need strong smart  confident young women
 to stand up and take the reins we know you can do it we love you thank you so much
