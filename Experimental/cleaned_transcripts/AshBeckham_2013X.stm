  i 'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet and not in the traditional sense not just the
 gay closet i think we all have closets your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time or telling someone that you 're pregnant 
 or telling someone you have cancer
 or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives all a closet is
 is a hard conversation  
 and although our topics may vary tremendously the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal 
 it is scary  and we hate it  and it needs to be done  
 several years ago  i was working at the south side walnut
  cafe 
 a local diner in town  and during my time there i would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity  
 not shaving my armpits quoting ani difranco lyrics as gospel  
 and depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently i had shaved my head the question would often be sprung on me usually by a little kid
 are you a boy or are you a girl 
 and there would be an awkward silence at the table i 'd clench my jaw a little tighter  hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance 
 the dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid  but i would say nothing  and i would seethe inside
 and it got to the point where every time i walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere
  three and ten years old i was ready to fight 
 and that is a terrible feeling  so i promised myself the next time i would say something 
 i would have that hard conversation  so within a matter of weeks it happens again 
 are you a boy or are you a girl familiar silence  but this time i 'm ready  and i am about to go all women 's studies one
  this table 
 i 've got my betty friedan quotes i 've got my gloria steinem quotes i 've even got this little bit from vagina monologues i 'm going to do  
 so i take a deep breath and i look down
 and staring back at me is a four year old girl in a pink dress  not a challenge to a feminist duel just a kid with a question are
 you a boy or are you a girl
  so i take another deep breath  squat down to next to her and say hey  i know it 's kind of confusing my hair is short like a boy 's and i wear boy 's clothes but i 'm a girl and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress and
 sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies well i 'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl 
 and this kid looks me dead in the eye without missing a beat and says my favorite pajamas are purple with fish can i get a pancake please
 and that was it just oh okay you 're a girl how about that pancake 
 it was the easiest hard conversation i have ever had 
 and why  because pancake girl and i we were both real with each other 
 so like many
  i 've lived in a few closets in my life and yeah most often my walls happened to be rainbow  but inside in the dark you can 't tell what color the walls are 
 you just know what it feels like to live in a closet  so really my closet is no different than yours
 or yours
 or yours  
 sure i 'll give you one hundred reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours but here 's the thing hard is not relative hard is hard who can tell me
  that explaining to someone you 've just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them who can tell me
 that his coming out story is harder than telling your five year old you 're getting a divorce there is no harder there is just
 hard 
 we need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else 's hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just commiserate on the fact that we all have
 hard at some point in our lives
  we all live in closets and they may feel safe  
 or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door  but i am here to tell you no matter what your walls are made of a closet is no place for a person to live thanks 
 so
 imagine yourself twenty years ago me i had a ponytail
  a strapless dress and high heeled shoes  i was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four year old that walked into the cafe  
 i was frozen by fear  curled up in the corner of my 
 closet clutching my gay grenade  and moving one muscle is the scariest thing i have ever
 done  my family my friends
  strangers i had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people and now i was turning the world upside down
 on purpose  
 i was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long but if you do not throw that grenade it will kill you 
 one of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister 's wedding
  it was the first time that many in attendance knew i was gay  so in doing my maid of honor duties in my black dress and heels 
 i walked around to tables and finally landed on a table of my parents ' friends folks that had known me for years 
 and after a little small talk one of the women shouted out i love nathan lane and the battle of gay
  we 've never been there but we 've heard it 's fabulous ash do you know my hairdresser antonio  he 's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend ash what 's your favorite tv show our favorite tv show favorite will & grace and you know who we love jack jack is our favorite 
 and then one woman stumped
 but wanting so desperately to show her support to let me know she was on my side she finally blurted out
 well sometimes my husband wears pink shirts 
 and i had a choice in that moment as all grenade throwers do 
 i could go back to my girlfriend and my gay loving table
 and mock their responses  chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct gay hoops i had brought with me or
 i could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one
  of the hardest things they had ever done  that starting
 and having that conversation
 was them coming out of their closets  sure  it would have been easy to point out where they felt short 
 it 's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying and what else
 can you ask someone to do but try  if you 're going to be real with someone you gotta be ready for real in
  return  so
 hard conversations are still not my strong suit ask anybody i have ever dated  
 but i 'm getting better  and i follow what i like to call the three pancake girl principles now please
 view this through gay colored lenses but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same 
 number one be authentic take the armor off be yourself that
  kid in the cafe had no armor but i was ready for battle 
 if you want someone to be real with you they need to know that you bleed too  
 number two be direct just say it rip the band aid off if you know you are gay just say it 
 if you tell your parents you might be gay they will hold out hope that this will change do not give them that sense of false hope
  and most important 
 be unapologetic 
 you are speaking your truth never apologize for that 
 and some folks may have gotten hurt along the way so sure  apologize for what you 've done  
 but never apologize for who you are and yeah  some folks
  may be disappointed but that is on them not on you those are their expectations of who you are not yours that is their story not
 yours  the only story that matters is the one that you want to write 
 so the next time you find yourself in a pitch black closet clutching your grenade know
 we have all been there before  and you may feel so very alone
  you are not 
 and we know it 's hard but we need you out here no matter what your walls are made of  
 because i guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open so be that person
 and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live
