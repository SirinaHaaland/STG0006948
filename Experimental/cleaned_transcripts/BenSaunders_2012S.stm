  take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually but i 'm going to read this question from
 an interview earlier this year philosophically  does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or
 replace our dreams of achieving
  achieving after all if it is being done somewhere by someone and we can participate virtually then why bother leaving the house 
 i 'm usually introduced as a polar explorer i 'm not sure that 's the most progressive or 21st century of
 job titles but
 i 've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the arctic circle so i get out of the house a fair
  bit  and in my nature i guess i am a doer of things more than i am a spectator or a contemplator of things and it 's that
 dichotomy  the gulf between
 ideas and action that i 'm going to try and explore briefly the pithiest answer to the question why that 's been dogging me for the last twelve years
 was credited certainly to this chap the
  standing at the back  second from the left george lee mallory many of you will know his name in one thousand nine hundred and twenty four he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of mt everest 
 he may or may not have been the first person to climb everest more than thirty years before edmund hillary no one knows if he got to the top 
  i 'm not actually sure that he did say that there 's very little evidence to suggest it but what he did say is actually far nicer and again i 've printed this i 'm going to read it out 
 the first question which you will ask
 and which i must try to answer is this what is the use of climbing mt  everest  
 and my answer must at once be it is no use  there is not the slightest prospect of any
  we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes  and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation 
 but otherwise nothing will come of it 
 we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver and not a gem nor any coal or iron we shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food so it is no use 
 if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain
  and goes out to meet it that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward then you won 't see why we go 
 what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy  
 and joy  after all is the end of life we don 't live to eat and make money we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life 
 that is what life means  and that is what life is for
 mallory 's argument that
 leaving the house embarking on these grand adventures is is joyful and fun however doesn 't tally that neatly with my own experience  the
 furthest i 've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of two thousand and four i still don 't know exactly what came over me but my plan was to make
 a solo and unsupported crossing of the arctic ocean
 i planned essentially
  to walk from the north coast of russia to the north pole and then to carry on to the north coast of canada  no one had ever done this  i was twenty six at the time 
 a lot of experts were saying it was impossible and my mum certainly wasn 't very keen on the idea 
 the journey from a small weather station on the north coast of siberia up to my final starting point the edge of the pack ice the coast of the arctic ocean took about five hours and
 if anyone watched fearless felix baumgartner
 going up  rather than just coming down you 'll appreciate  the sense of apprehension as i sat in a helicopter thundering north
  and the sense i think if anything of impending doom i sat there wondering what on earth i had gotten myself into  
 there was a bit of fun a bit of joy i was
  remember sitting there looking down at my sledge i had my skis ready to go i had a satellite phone 
 a pump action shotgun in case i was attacked by a polar bear i remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter we were both thundering through this incredible siberian dawn and part of me felt a bit like a cross between jason bourne and wilfred thesiger  part of me
 felt quite proud of myself but
 mostly i was just utterly terrified
  and that journey lasted ten weeks seventy two days i didn 't see anyone else  we took this photo next to the helicopter beyond that i didn 't see anyone for ten weeks
  the north pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea so i 'm traveling over the frozen surface of the arctic ocean  nasa described conditions that year as the worst since records began i 
  was dragging one hundred and eighty kilos of food and fuel and supplies about four hundred pounds  the average temperature for the ten weeks was minus thirty five
  minus fifty was the coldest so again there wasn 't an awful lot of of joy or fun to be had one of
 the magical things about this journey however is that because i 'm walking over the sea over this floating drifting shifting
 crust of ice that 's floating on top of the arctic ocean is it 's an environment that 's in a constant state of flux the ice is always moving breaking up drifting around refreezing so the scenery that i saw for nearly three months was unique to me no one else will ever could ever
  possibly see
 the views the vistas that i saw for for ten weeks  
 and that i guess is probably the finest argument for leaving the house i can try to tell you what it was like  
 but you 'll never know what it was like  and the more i try to explain that i felt lonely  i was the only human being in five point
  it was cold nearly minus seventy five with windchill on a bad day the more words fall short and i 'm unable to do it justice  
 and it seems to me  therefore that the doing you know to try
 to to experience to engage to endeavor  rather than to watch and to wonder that 's where
 the the real meat of life is to be found  the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days
 and i would add a cautionary note here however
  in my experience there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what 's humanly possible now i don 't just mean in the field of daft macho edwardian 
  style derring do but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer there is something addictive about this and in my case i think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit i can 't explain quite how good it is
  until you 've tried it but
 it has the capacity to to burn up all the money i can get my hands on to ruin every relationship i 've ever had
  so be careful what you wish for 
 mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain and i wonder if that 's the case whether there 's something in the in the challenge itself in the endeavor and particularly in the
  challenges that face humanity that that call out to us  and in my experience that 's certainly the case 
 there is one unfinished challenge that 's been calling out to me for most of my adult life 
 many of you will know the story this is a photo of captain scott and his team scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the south pole no one knew what was
  it was utterly unmapped at the time we knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of antarctica 
 scott as many of you will know was beaten to it by roald amundsen and his norwegian team who used dogs and dogsleds scott 's team were on foot all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges 
 and they arrived at the pole to find the norwegian flag already there
 i 'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized all five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey  there is
 a sort of misconception nowadays that it 's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure when i talk about antarctica people often say
  no one has ever walked from the very coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again 
 it is arguably the most audacious endeavor of that edwardian golden age of exploration and it seemed to me high time given everything we have figured out in the century since from 
  from scurvy to solar panels that it was high time someone someone had a go at finishing the job so that 's precisely what i 'm setting out to do this time next year in october i 'm leading a team of three
 will take us about
 four months to make this return journey that 's the scale the red line is is obviously halfway to the pole we have to turn around and come back again i 'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting 
 you 'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever
 finally come up with a a pithy answer to the question
