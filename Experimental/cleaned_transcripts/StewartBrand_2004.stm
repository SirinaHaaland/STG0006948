  welcome to ten thousand feet let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you
 once upon a time i did a book called how buildings learn today 's event you might call how
  for ten years i 've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that
 we can get long term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare
 or in some cases non existent it would be helpful if humanity got into the habit
 of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter but you
  next ten thousand years
 and the last ten thousand years basically civilization 's story so far  
 so we have the long now foundation in san francisco it 's an incubator for about a dozen projects all having to do with continuity over the long term 
 our core project
 is a rather ambitious folly
 i suppose a mythic undertaking to build 
  keep good time for for that long a period
 and the design problems
 of a project like that are just absolutely delicious go to the clock
 and what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago it 's the first working prototype of the clock it 's about nine feet high designed by danny hillis and alexander rose
  's presently in london and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there  so the design problem for today
 is going to be how do you house
 an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick save time beautifully for one hundred centuries well this was the first solution
 alexander rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps  and it looked like a way to
  go until you start thinking about what does deep time
 do to a building well this is what deep time does to a building this is the parthenon
 it 's only two thousand four
 hundred and fifty years old and look what happened to it here 's a beautiful project they really knew it 'd last forever because they 'd build it out of absolutely huge stones  
 and now it 's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for that 's what happens to buildings they 're vulnerable
  even the most durable and intactable buildings like the pyramids of giza are in bad shape when you look up close they 've been looted inside and out 
 and they 're built to protect things but they don 't protect things 
 so we got to thinking if you can 't put things safely in a building where can you safely put them  we thought ok  
  how about underground with a view underground in a place that 's really solid so the obvious answer was 
 we need a mountain you don 't want just any mountain  you need absolutely the right mountain
 if you 're going to have a clock for ten thousand years  so here 's an image of the long view of the search problem  
 and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain
  so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest we looked at mesas in new mexico
 we were looking at dead volcanoes in arizona  then roger kennedy who was the director of the national parks service  led us to eastern nevada to america 's newest and oldest national park which is called great basin national park it
 's right on the eastern border of nevada
 it 's the highest range in the state over thirteen thousand feet and you 'll notice that on the left on the
  it 's very steep and on the right it 's gentle 
 this place is remote  
 it 's over two hundred miles from any major city  it 's nowhere near any interstate or railroad  and it 's
 the only thing that goes by is what 's called america 's loneliest highway u s fifty  
 now inside the yellow line here on the right is that 's all national park  inside the green line
 is
 national forest and then over to the left is bureau of land management land and some private land now as it happened that two mile long strip right in the middle this vertical was available
 because it was private land 
 and thanks to jay walker who was here and mitch kapor who was here who started the process long now was able to get that two mile long strip of land
  look at the grand truth of what 's there we 're in pole canyon looking west
 up the western escarpment of mount washington  which is eleven thousand six hundred feet on top 
 those white cliffs are a dense cambrian limestone  that 's a 2 000 foot thick formation  and
 it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock 
 it would be a pilgrimage to get to it
  would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is so last june the long now board some staff and some donors and
 and advisors made a two week expedition to the mountain
 to explore it and investigate  one if it 's the right mountain  and two if it 's the right mountain
  might actually work for us now danny hillis
 sort of framed the problem he has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work it 's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure 
 it starts with the image 
 the image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey in this case it might well be an image of the clock  
 then there 's the point of embarkation that is the point of transition
 from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest then
 this is a nice image of it there 's the labyrinth the
 labyrinth is a concept it 's like a twilight zone it 's a place where it 's difficult where you get disoriented maybe you get scared
 but you have to go through it if you 're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration  then
 there should always be in sight the draw a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to to finish the process
  getting there  now brian eno who 's been in the thick of the long now process spent two years making a
  january seven thousand and three and it 's bell studies for the clock of the long now 
 based on parts of it are based on an algorithm that danny hillis developed  
 so that a peal of ten bells makes a different peal every day for ten thousand years the hillis algorithm
  ten factorial gives you that number and in
 fact pretty soon we 'll hear the sound  january seven thousand and three there it is 
 ok back to danny 's list
  number five of the seven is the payoff  this is it the climax the goal the main thing that you 're trying to get to
  and then danny
 says a really great journey
 will have a secret payoff something you didn 't expect
 that caps what you did expect  then there 's the return you 've
 got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world so you have time to assimilate what you 've learned 
 and then  how about a memento  number seven at the end of it there 's something physical a kind of reward that you take away it might be a piece of a core drill
  something that 's just yours  how do you study a mountain
 for the kinds of things we 're talking about this is not a normal building project what do you look for what are the elements that will most affect
 your ideas and decisions 
 start with borders if you look on the left side of the cliffs here that 's national park that 's sacrosanct you can 't do anything with that to the right of it is national forest there 's possibilities the borders are important
 were
 mines  weather approaches and elevation and especially trees look at those things up on top there it
 turns out that mount washington is covered with bristlecone pines they 're
 the world 's oldest living thing people think they 're just the size of shrubs but that
 's not actually true  there are trees on that mountain that are five thousand years
  old and still living
 the wood is so solid it 's like stone and it lasts for a long time  so when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain  
 some of them go back ten thousand years the stone itself is absolutely beautiful sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there 
 we had tree ring analysts from the university
 of arizona
  join us on the expedition 
  you guys have a pine cone handy  now 's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it
 especially on the end that 's interesting you 'll find out why it 's called a bristlecone
 little sensory experience here 's danny hillis in the midst of a
  pine forest on long now land i should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered  led by a theory edmund schulman in 
 had been studying trees under great stress at timberline 
 and came to the realization that he put in an article in science magazine called longevity under adversity in conifers 
 and then based on that principle he started looking around at the various trees at timberline
 and realized that the bristlecone pines he found some in the white mountains that were over four thousand years old  
 longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right ok
 onto the mines the first asking price for the property when we looked at it 
 was one billion dollars for one hundred and eighty acres and a couple of mines
  because the owner said there 's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain and we said wow that 's great listen we 'll counter
 how about zero 
 and we 're a non profit foundation you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction 
 all you have to do is prove to the government
  years went by and there was some kind of back and forth and by and by thanks to mitch and jay we were able to buy the whole property for one hundred and forty thousand dollars 
 this is one of the mines it doesn 't have any beryllium in it it 's called the pole adit
  and it does have tungsten a little bit of tungsten left over that 's the kind of mine it was  but it
  a straight line due east into the range into very interesting territory
 except that as you 'll see when we go inside in a minute we were hoping for limestone
 but in there is just shale 
 and shale is not quite completely competent rock competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring the
 shale would like some shoring and so parts of it are caved in in there that 's ben roberts from he 's the bat specialist from the national park
 there are many wonders back in there like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers
 ok here 's another mine that 's up on top of the property 
 and it dates back to one thousand eight hundred and seventy that 's what the property was originally built around it was a set of mining claims 
 it was a very productive silver mine 
 in fact it was
  mine in nevada  and it ran year round you can imagine what it was like in the winter at ten thousand feet  you may recognize a couple of the miners there there 's
 jeff bezos on the right and paul saville on the left
 looking for galena  which is the lead silver thing they didn 't find any they both kept their day jobs here
 's the last
  's called the bonanza adit it 's down in a canyon and
 alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey
 the whole mine it 's a mile deep and they also found four species of bats in there
  now almost all those mines by the way meet underneath the mountain  they don 't quite  but it 's something to think about 
 they don 't quite meet let 's go to weather 
 mountains specialize in interesting weather  way more interesting than monterey even today
 and so one tuesday morning last june  there we were woke up in the morning the mountain was covered with snow 
 that was a great time to go up and visit our
 weather station which again thanks to mitch kapor we 're building up there  and
 it 's a pretty interesting scene  this is on the left there the joyful lady is pat irwin
  who 's the regional head of the national forest service  and
 they gave us the temporary use permit to be there  we want a temporary use permit for the clock eventually 10 000 year temporary use permit 
 the weather station 's pretty interesting kurt bollacker and alexander rose designed a radically wireless station it runs on solar  
 and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite
 trails in the atmosphere to a place in bozeman
 the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to san francisco where we put the data in real time up on our website  
 and there you see a week of weather at nine thousand four hundred feet on
 mount washington  let 's go to approaches as it happens
 there are no trails anywhere on mount washington just a few old mining roads like this so you have to bushwhack everywhere
  but there 's no bears  and there 's no poison oak  and there 's basically no people because
 this place has been empty for a long time you can hike for days and not encounter anybody well here 's a
 potential approach you need to come up the lincoln canyon 
 it 's this beautiful world all of its own surrounded by cliffs and it 's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom
  you get to this barrier  and
 it actually presents a problem  so you can scratch lincoln canyon as an approach  
 another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain you can see why we sometimes call it long mountain  and from where you 're standing at six
  thousand feet in the valley it 's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at seven thousand six hundred feet and you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest 
 to the high base of the cliffs at ten thousand five hundred feet where there 's a bit of a problem 
  check
 those are 600 foot vertical walls there  so alexander rose wanted to
 explore this route  and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck
 at eight thousand nine hundred feet and headed up the mountain  now  as you gain elevation your iq goes
  but your emotional affect goes up which is great for having a mythic experience whether you want to or not in fact  danny hillis can
 estimate altitude by how much math he can 't do in his head 
 now i happened to be on the radio with alexander when he got to to this point at the base of the cliffs and he said
  there 's a hidden notch  i think i can get up a ways 
 now  he 's a rock climber but you know he 's our executive director i don 't want him killed  i know he 's going to love cliffs i 'm saying be careful be careful be careful 
 then he starts going up and the next thing i hear is i
 'm half way up  it 's like climbing stairs i 'm going up sixty degrees it 's a secret
  the next thing i hear is i 've made it to the top you can see all of creation from up here and he dashed across the top of the mountains 
 in fact  there he is that 's alexander rose first ascent of the western face to mount washington and a solo ascent
 at that 
 this discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them  we realized that we had to name this
  thing that alexander discovered how about zander 's crevice no 
 so we finally decided on alexander 's siq zander 's siq is named after
 some of you have been to petra there 's this wonderful
 slot canyon that leads into petra called the siq and so this is the siq  and it really is hidden i can 't find it in this image and i 'm not sure you can
  when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there and that brings it out now danny and i were up at this same area one day and danny looked over to the right
 and noticed something halfway up the cliffs which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it and supposed
 that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view
 and the people toiling up the mountain could see them  these tiny little people up there incredibly halfway up the cliff how did they get there  do i have to do that 
 and so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth  you can get another angle on on danny 's porch
 by going around to the south
 and looking north
  the whole formation there  and
 you need to know that danny 's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day  and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate 
 so even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on the clock will keep
 perfectly good time  so here we 're looking from the south look north  this is all
 forest service land if you go up on top of those cliffs  that 's some of the long now land in those trees  
 and if you go up there and look back
 then you 'll get a sense of of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain  that 's the long view  that 's eighty miles to the horizon and that 's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs
  that 's
 a different place to be  it 's eleven thousand four hundred feet and it 's exquisite
  go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs it 's six hundred foot just about a yard to the left of kurt bollacker 's foot there is a 600 foot drop 
 he 's ambling on over to zander 's siq that 's what it looks like
 looking down it  we should probably put in a rail or something over on the eastern side
 it 's gentle as you can
  see and that 's not snow that 's what the white limestone looks like you also see there a
 a bighorn sheep their herd was reintroduced from
 wyoming  
 and they 're doing pretty well but they 've got a bit of trouble  this is danny hillis and he 's figuring out a design problem he 's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long
  now land would appear from down in the valley
 to be the actual peak of the  mountain because the real peak is hidden around the corner  this is what
 in the infantry we used to call the military crest 
 and as it turned out the answer is yes  that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak and that might be conjured with 
 we gradually realized we have three serious design
 domains to work on with this one is the experience of the mountain  
 another is the experience in the mountain  and the third is the experience from the mountain  which is really dominated
 by the view shed of the spring valley there behind danny and if you look off to the right 
 out there  fifteen miles across to the schell creek range 
 in the front  there are ten ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains in fact there are artesian wells where water
 springs right into the air 
 one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch and i 'll
 take you there for a minute it 's a very nice ranch  alfalfa and and cattle run by paul and ronnie brenham  
 and it 's pretty idyllic it 's also hard work  
 and most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going this is their view to the west of the schell creek
  range and if you go out to that line of trees at the far end you 'll see what the valley used to look like this is
 rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years 
 and a scheme emerged that long now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley  
 because those ten ranches with their seventeen thousand acres dominate a five hundred
  square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on and there 's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars
 and gradually restore it to its wild condition and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the national park  
 and it would double the size of great basin national park that would be swell ok
 let 's take one more look at the mountain
  clock experience should be profound  but from the outside it should be invisible now at the base of the high cliffs
 there 's this natural cave it 's only about twelve feet deep  but what if it were deepened from inside you excavated from somewhere came up from inside and deepened it 
 and then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite  and this stone takes a perfect polish
  polish you 'd have a a polished set of passages and and chambers in there eventually leading
 to the ten thousand year clock and
 it 's not a mine this would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain  and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from
  this is architecture not made by building  but by what you very carefully take away 
 so that 's what the mountain taught us most of the amazingness of the clock
 we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain  all we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them it
 's not a clock in a mountain it 's a mountain clock 
  indians in the southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything they say
