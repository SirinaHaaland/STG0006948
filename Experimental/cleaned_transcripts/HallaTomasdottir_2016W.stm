  i feel incredibly lucky to be from a country that 's generally considered to be the best place in the world to be a woman
  on a strike  they did no work that day  whether they held professional jobs
 or had the work of the home they marched into the center of reykjavk ninety percent of women participated
 and peacefully and in solidarity
 asked for equality nothing worked in iceland that day
  because nothing works when women are not at work 
 five years later  
 icelanders had the courage to be the first country in the world to democratically elect a woman
 as their
  i will never forget this day 
 that president  vigds as we know her by her first name  
 stepped out on the balcony of her own home a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won 
 this woman was an incredible role model for me and everyone growing up at that time  including boys
  boys 
 she frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her after a couple of terms in office and asked can boys really grow up to be president 
 role models really matter but even with such strong role models who i am so grateful
  i was encouraged to run for president my first reaction was who am i
 to run for president who am i to be president 
 it turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men 
 so a study done in the us in two thousand and eleven showed that sixty two percent of men
  of women that 's gap of sixteen percentage points  and it 's the same gap that existed a decade earlier  
 and it really is a shame  
 because i am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders and more principle based leadership in general  
 so my decision
 to run
  ultimately came down to the fact that i felt
 that i had to do my bit  
 even if i had no political experience to step up and try to be part of creating the world
 that will make sense and be sustainable for our kids  and a world where we truly allow
 both our boys and girls to be all they can be  and it was
 the journey of my life  it was amazing the journey started with
 potentially as many as twenty candidates it boiled down to nine
 candidates qualifying and ultimately the race came down to four of us three men
 and me 
 but that 's not all the drama yet 
 you may think you have drama in the us but i can 
 i can assure you we had our
  own drama in iceland 
 so our sitting president of twenty years announced initially that he was not going to run  which is probably what gave rise to so many candidates considering running 
 then later he changed his mind when our prime minister
 resigned following the infamous panama papers
 that implicated him and his family  and there was a popular protest in iceland so the sitting president thought
 they needed a trusted leader 
 a few days later relations to his wife and her family 's companies were also discovered in the panama papers  
 and so he withdrew from the race again 
 before doing so he said he was doing that because now there were two qualified men
 who he felt could fill his shoes running for office
  so on may nine forty five days
 before election day  it was not looking too good for me  
 i did not even make the graph in the newspaper 
 the polls had me at one percent  but that was still the highest that any woman announcing her candidacy had
  so it would be an understatement to say that i had to work extremely hard to get my seat at the table
 and access to television  because the network decided that they would only include those with two point five percent or more in the polls in the first tv debate  
 i found out on the afternoon of the first tv debate that i would participate along with the three men and i found out on
  live tv that i came in at exactly two point five percent on the day of the first tv debate 
 so challenges 
 the foremost challenges i had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with
  let 's start with media there are those who say gender doesn 't matter when it comes to media and politics i can 't say that i agree  
 it proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media 
 as a matter of fact the leading candidate appeared in broadcast media  eighty seven times in the months leading up to the elections whereas i appeared thirty one times  
 and i am not saying media is doing this consciously i think largely this
  has to do with unconscious bias because in media much like everywhere else 
 we have both conscious and unconscious bias  and we need to have the courage to talk about it if we want to change it 
 when i finally got access to tv the first question i got was are you going to quit 
  and that was a hard one
 but of course with one percent to two point five percent in the polls maybe it 's understandable 
 but media really matters and every time i appeared on tv we saw and experienced a rise in the polls  so i know firsthand how much this matters and why we have to talk about it 
 i was the only one out of the final four candidates that never got a front page interview
 i was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates and out of coverage
  about the elections  so i did face this  but i will say this to to compliment the icelandic media  i
 got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit applause
 so kudos to them  but there is another experience that 's very
  i ran as an independent candidate not with any political party or muscle behind me that lack of experience
 and lack of access to resources probably came at a cost to our campaign  
 but it also allowed us to innovate and do politics differently  we ran a positive campaign  
 and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that it may be the reason why i had
  less airtime on tv because i wanted to show other contenders respect 
 when access to media proved to be so difficult  we ran our own media  i ran live facebook sessions where i took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot  
 and we put all the questions i got and all the answers on an open facebook because we thought transparency
  is important if you want to establish trust and when reaching young voters proved to be challenging  i became a snapchatter 
 i got young people to teach me how to do that and i used every filter on snapchat during the last part of the campaign  
 and i actually had to use a lot of humor and humility as i was very bad at it but we grew the following amongst young people by
  doing that  so it 's possible to run a different type of campaign  
 but unfortunately one cannot talk about politics without mentioning money i
 am sad that it is that way but it 's true  and we had less financial resources than the other candidates this probably
 was partly due to the fact that i think i had a harder time asking for financial
  support  and maybe i also had the ambition to do more with less  some would call that very womanly of me  
 but even with one third the
 media one third the financial resources and only an entrepreneurial team but an amazing team  we managed to surprise everyone
 on election night  when the first
  numbers came in i surprised myself as you may see in that photo 
 so the first numbers 
 i came in neck to neck to the leading candidate 
 well too early because i didn 't quite pull that  but i came in second  and we went
  long way from the one percent with nearly a third of the vote  
 and we beat the polls by an unprecedented margin or ten percentage points above what the last poll came in at  
 some people call me the real winner of the election because of this and there are many people who encouraged me to run again  
 but what really makes me proud is to know that i earned proportionately higher
  percentage support from the young people 
 and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in two thousand and forty 
 she is thirteen  and she had never been on tv
  she was sincere  and she was supportive of her mother this was probably the highlight of my campaign 
 but there was another one these are preschool girls out
  and they found a poster of me on a bus stop and they saw the need to kiss it audience aw 
 this picture was really enough of a win for me what we see we can be 
 so screw fear and challenges 
 it matters that women run  and it 's time
 for women to run for office be it the office of the ceo or the office of the president
 i also managed to put an impression on your very own new yorker 
 i earned a new title a living emoji of sincerity 
 it is possibly my proudest title yet  
 and the reason is that women too often get penalized for using what i
  call their emotional capital  but i know from experience that we become so good when we do just that 
 and we need more of that 
 we celebrated as if we had won on election night  because that 's how we felt so you don 't necessarily have to reach that
  office you just have to go for it and you your family your friends everyone working with you if you do it well you will grow beyond anything you will experience before 
 so we had a good time  
 and i learned a lot on this journey probably more lessons than i can share here in the time we have today  
 but rest assured  it was hard work
  i lost a lot of sleep during those months it took resilience and perseverance
 to not quit  but i learned something that i knew before on the one percent day  
 and that is that you can only be good when you are truly authentically listening to your own voice and working in alignment with that  
 as a good sister
  of mine sometimes says you may cheat on your intuition  but your intuition never cheats on you 
 i think it 's also very important and you all know this that on any journey you go on it 's the team you take along 
 it 's having people around you who share
  your vision but are different in every other way 
 that 's the formula for success for me  and i am blessed with an amazing husband  here today 
 an incredible family 
 and great friends and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena and pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible 
 as a matter of fact the leading pr expert told me
 before i made my decision that i would do well to get
  seven percent  
 i appreciated his perspective because he was probably right  
 and he was basing it on valuable experience but on the one percent day i decided here to show him that he was wrong 
 it 's very important to mention this because i did lose a lot of sleep and i worked hard and so did the people with me 
  we can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves  
 and it 's two things that i think are very important in that in surrounding yourself with people and practices that nourish you  but it 's equally important maybe even more important to have the courage
 to get rid of people and practices that take away your energy including the wonderful bloggers and commentators  
 i took a lot of support from others in doing this  and i made the decision to go high when
  others went low  and that 's partly how i kept my energy going throughout all of this  
 and when i lost my energy for a moment and i did from time to time it wasn 't easy
 i went back to why i decided to run  and how i had decided to run my own race i
  the g 's representing the icelandic words and the first one is called gagn i ran to do good to be of service  and i wanted
 servant leadership to be at the center of how i worked and everybody else in the campaign  
 second one is glei or joy  
 i decided to enjoy the journey there was a lot to be taken out of the journey no matter if the destination was reached or not and i tried my utmost to inspire others to do so as
  well 
 third is gagnsi i was open to any questions i kept no secrets  and it was all open on facebook and websites  because i think if you 're choosing your president you deserve answers to your questions 
 last but not least i don 't need to explain that in this room  we
  i am incredibly glad that i had the courage to run to risk failure but receive success on so many levels  
 i can 't tell you that it was easy  but i can tell you  and i think my
  entire team will agree with me that it was worth it
  without saying that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to iceland and vote for you but of
 course we probably can 't vote there but one thing we can get from iceland and have always gotten is inspiration i mean i 'm old enough to remember 
 when all the icelandic women walked out and that really was a very big factor in launching the women 's movement you made a reference to it earlier i 'd love to bring the picture back up
  and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill  and then what you may not know because our american media did not report it 
 the icelandic women walked out again
 on monday
  be the best place in the world to be a woman
  this is that young women and men participated
 in greater numbers than before because it is time that we close the pay gap pm 
 so i 'm not going to ask halla to commit right now to what she 's doing next but
 i will say that you 'd have a very large volunteer army should you decide to do that again
