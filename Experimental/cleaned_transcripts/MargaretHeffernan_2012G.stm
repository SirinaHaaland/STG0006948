  in oxford in the 1950s there was a fantastic doctor who was very unusual named alice stewart 
 and alice was unusual partly because of course she was a woman  which was pretty rare in the 1950s and she was brilliant  she was one
 fellow to be elected to the royal college of physicians 
 she was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married after she had kids 
 and even after she got divorced and was a single parent she continued her medical work 
 and she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science the emerging field of epidemiology the study of patterns in disease
  but like every scientist she appreciated that to make her mark what she needed to do was find a hard problem
 and solve it 
 the hard problem that alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers 
 most disease is correlated with poverty but in the case of childhood cancers  the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families
  what she wanted to know could explain this anomaly  
 now alice had trouble getting funding for her research in the end she got just one thousand pounds from the lady tata memorial prize  and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data 
 now she had no idea what to look for this really was a needle in a
  haystack sort of search so she asked
 everything she could think of had the children eaten boiled sweets had they consumed colored drinks did they eat fish and chips 
 did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing what time of life had they started school  
 and when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can
  only dream of by a rate of two to one  the children who had died
 had had mothers who had been x rayed when pregnant 
 now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom  
 conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point a threshold  
 it flew in the face of conventional wisdom which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age which was the
 x ray machine  
 and it flew in the face of doctors ' idea of themselves  
 which was as people who helped patients they didn 't harm them  
 nevertheless alice stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in the lancet
 in one thousand nine hundred and fifty six 
 people got very excited there was talk of the nobel prize  and alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find
 before they disappeared in fact she need not have hurried  
 it was fully  twenty five years before the british and medical british and american medical establishments
 abandoned the
  pregnant women 
 the data was out there  it was open it was freely available 
 but nobody wanted to know 
 a child a week was dying  but nothing changed  openness alone
 can 't drive change
  years alice stewart had a very big fight on her hands  so how did she know that she was right  
 well she had a fantastic model for thinking  
 she worked with a statistician named george kneale and george was pretty much everything that alice wasn 't so alice was very outgoing and sociable 
 and george was a recluse 
 alice was very warm
  very empathetic with her patients george frankly preferred numbers to people  
 but he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship he said my job is to prove dr stewart
 wrong 
 he actively sought disconfirmation different ways of looking at her models at her statistics  different ways of crunching the data
 in order to disprove her he saw
  his job as creating conflict around her theories because it was only by not being able to prove
 that she was wrong that george could give alice the confidence she needed
 to know that she was right  it 's a fantastic model of collaboration
 thinking partners who
 i wonder how many of us have or dare to have such collaborators 
 alice and george were very good at conflict they saw it
 as thinking  so what does that kind of constructive conflict
  first of all it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves 
 that means we have to resist the neurobiological drive  which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves 
 and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds  different disciplines different ways of thinking and different experience 
  and find ways to engage with them that requires a lot of patience
 and a lot of energy and the more i 've thought about this the more i think really that that 's a kind of love 
 because you simply won 't commit that kind of energy and time
 if you don 't really care  and it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds alice 's daughter told me
 that every time alice went head to head with a fellow scientist 
 they made her think and think and think again my mother she said my mother didn 't enjoy a fight  
 but she was really good at them 
 so it 's one thing to do that in a one to one relationship
  but it strikes me that the biggest problems we face many of the biggest disasters that we 've experienced 
 mostly haven 't come from individuals they 've come from organizations some of them bigger than countries many of them capable of affecting hundreds thousands even millions
 of lives  so how do organizations think well for the most
  and that isn 't because they don 't want to it 's really because they can 't and they can 't because the people inside of them
 are too afraid
 of conflict in surveys of european and american executives fully eighty five percent of them acknowledged
 that they had issues or concerns at work
 that they were afraid to raise afraid of the conflict
  that that would provoke 
 afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage and felt that they were bound to lose
 eighty five percent
 is a really big number 
 it means that organizations mostly can 't do what george and alice so triumphantly did they can 't think
 together
 and it means that people like many of us who have run organizations 
 and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can mostly fail
 to get the best out of them  
 so how do we develop the skills that we need because it does take
  if we aren 't going to be afraid of conflict we have to see it as thinking and then we have to get really good at it 
 so recently i worked with
 an executive named joe and joe worked for a medical device company  
 and joe was very worried about the device that he was working on he thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of
  error
 that could really hurt people he was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help  but when he looked around his organization nobody else seemed to be at all worried 
 so he didn 't really want to say anything after all maybe they knew something he didn 't maybe he 'd look stupid
  but he kept worrying about it and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do
 was leave a job he loved 
 in the end  
 joe and i found a way for him to raise his concerns and what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation it turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts  
 so now joe had allies
 they could think together  and yes there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument  but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative 
 to solve the problem 
 and to change the device 
 joe was what a lot of people
  a crank at all he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served  but he had been so afraid of conflict 
 until finally he became more afraid
 of the silence  and when he dared to speak he discovered much more inside himself
 and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined  
 and his colleagues don 't think of him as a crank they think of him
 as a leader  
 so how do we have these conversations more easily and more often  well
  the university of delft requires that its phd students
 have to submit five statements that they 're prepared to defend it doesn 't really matter
 what the statements are about what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority 
 i think it 's a fantastic system but i think leaving it to phd candidates is far too few people and way too late in life 
 i think we need to be teaching these skills
 to kids and adults at every stage of their development  if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society  
 the fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we 've witnessed
 rarely come from information that is secret
  it comes from information that is freely available and out there  but that we are willfully blind to because we can 't handle don 't want to handle  the conflict
 that it provokes  
 but when we dare to break that silence or when we dare to see and we create conflict we enable
 enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking  
 open information is fantastic open networks are essential  
 but the truth won 't set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it  
 openness isn 't the end
