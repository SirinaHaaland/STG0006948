  three years ago
 i was in london and somebody called howard burton came to me
 and said i represent a group of people and we want to start an institute
  we have about one hundred and twenty million dollars  
 and we want to do it well  we want to be in the forefront fields  and we want to do it differently  we want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done it
 took me about twenty five seconds to decide that that was a good idea three years later we have the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in waterloo
  most exciting job ive ever had and its the first time ive had a job where im afraid to go away
 because of everything thats going to happen in this week when im here but in any case what im going to do
 in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about  so we think a lot about what really makes science work
  the first thing that anybody who knows science and has been around science is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong 
 there is no method on the other hand  somehow we manage to reason together as a community from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree 
  about and this is by the way something that a democratic society also has to do so how does it work
  well  my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics 
 and here are some of the ethical principles im not going to read them all to you because im not in teacher mode im
 in entertain  amaze mode 
 but one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and
  as hard as they can for what they believe  but
 were all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide you know 
 whether im right or somebody else is right are the people in our community in the next generation  in thirty and fifty years 
 so its this combination of respect for the tradition and community were in and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere that
 makes science work  
 and being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions 
 i believe  teaches us about democracy not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a
 citizen in democracy but there has been historically a relationship between how people think about space and time 
 and what the cosmos is and how people think about the society that they live in and i want to talk about three stages
 in that evolution the first science of cosmology that was anything like science was aristotelian science and
  the earth is in the center  then there are these crystal spheres the sun the moon the planets and finally the celestial sphere where the stars are  and everything in this universe has a place
 and aristotles law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place which was of course the rule of the society that aristotle lived in and more importantly the medieval society
  through christianity embraced aristotle
 and
 blessed it
  and the idea is that everything is defined where something is is defined with respect to this last sphere  the celestial sphere outside of which is this eternal perfect realm  where lives god who is the
 ultimate judge of everything  so that is both aristotelian cosmology  and in a certain sense medieval
  there was a revolution in thinking about
 space and time and motion and so forth of newton and at the same time there was a revolution in social thought
 of john locke and his collaborators and they were very closely associated in fact newton and locke were friends  their way of thinking about
 space and time
  and motion on the one hand  and a society on the other hand were closely related  and let me show you in a newtonian universe theres no center
 thank you there
 are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed absolute framework of space and time its meaningful to say absolutely where something is
 in space because thats defined not with respect to say where other things are but with respect to this absolute notion of space which for newton
 was god  now  similarly in lockes society
 there are
 individuals who have certain rights properties in a formal sense 
 and those are defined with respect to some absolute  abstract notions of rights and justice and so forth  
 which
 are independent of what else has happened in the society of who else there is of the history and so forth
 there is also an omniscient observer who knows everything who is god who is in a certain sense outside the universe  because he has no role in anything that happens 
  but is in a certain sense everywhere because space is just the way that god knows where everything is according to newton 
  and newtonian physics  now  in the 20th century we had a revolution
 that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century  and which is still going on it was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory and 
 merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity 
  now  and in this universe theres nothing fixed and absolute 
 zilch ok this universe is described by being a network of relationships 
 space is just one aspect so theres no meaning to say absolutely where something is theres only where it is relative
 to everything else that is and this network
  so we call it a relational universe all properties of things are about these kinds of relationships  and also  if youre embedded in such a network of relationships  your view 
  of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations and theres no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making
  so this is
 general relativity this is quantum theory this is also if you talk to legal scholars the foundations of new ideas in legal thought  
 theyre thinking about the same things and not only that they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often  so theres an interesting discussion
 going on there this last view of cosmology is called the relational
  the main slogan here is that theres nothing outside the universe  which means that theres no place
 to put an explanation for something outside  so in such a relational universe if you come upon something
 thats ordered and structured like this device here or that device there or something beautiful like all the living things all of you guys in the room
 guys in physics by the way is a
  you want to know youre a person you want to know how is it made 
 and in a relational universe the only possible explanation was somehow it made itself there must be mechanisms of 
 inside the universe that make things because theres no place to put a maker outside as there was in the
  so in a relational universe we must have processes of 
 now  darwin taught us that there are processes of 
 that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see so it works but not only that  if you think about how natural selection works
  then it turns out that natural selection
 would only make sense in such a relational universe that is natural selection
 works on properties like fitness  which are about relationships of some species to some other species  
 darwin wouldnt make sense in an aristotelian universe  and wouldnt really make sense in a newtonian universe  
 so a theory
 of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion
 of what are the properties of biological systems and if you push that all the way down really it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational
  now  not only that but einstein taught us
 that gravity is the result of the world
  if it wasnt for gravity there wouldnt be life because gravity
 causes stars to form and live for a very long time keeping pieces of the world like the surface of the earth out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve  
 in the 20th century we saw the independent development of two big themes in science in the
 biological sciences they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in  a self organized way 
 that was the triumph of 
 and so forth and
 slowly that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences the human sciences economics et cetera 
 at the same time we physicists
 have been busy
 trying to make sense of and build on and integrate
  the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity  and what weve been working out is the implications really of the idea that the universe is made up of relations 
  science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas  the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world on the one hand
  world on the other hand  
 and also is that in the 21st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology and our thinking about society are 
  both going to continue to evolve  and what theyre evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas  darwinism and relationalism
  if you think about democracy
 from this perspective 
 a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests many different agendas many different individuals many
 different points of view  each one is incomplete 
 because youre embedded in a network of relationships  any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships and you understand some things better than other things
  and because of that theres a continual jostling
 and give and take which is
 politics and politics is in the ideal sense 
 the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a
