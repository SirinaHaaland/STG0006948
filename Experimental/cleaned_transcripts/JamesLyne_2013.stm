  be showing some of the cybercriminals ' latest and nastiest creations so basically  please don 't go and download any of the viruses that i show you 
 some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like and i thought i 'd give you a quick insight into my career so far
 's a pretty accurate description  this is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like 
 so today computer viruses and trojans  
 designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars 
 some malicious code today goes as far
  as targeting power utilities and infrastructure 
 let me give you a quick snapshot of what malicious code is capable of today  
 right now every second eight new users are joining the internet 
 today  we will see two hundred and fifty thousand individual new computer viruses  
 we will see thirty thousand
 new
  just to kind of tear down a myth here lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus it 's because you went to a porn site right 
 well actually statistically speaking if you only visit porn sites you 're safer
  people normally write that down by the way 
 actually about eighty percent of these are small business websites getting infected today 's
  what do they look like well many of you have the image  don 't you of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement hacking away for notoriety  
 but actually today cybercriminals are wonderfully professional and organized 
 in fact they have product adverts 
 you can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline  check out this one i found man so you 're here for one reason and that reason
  is because you need your business competitors rivals haters or whatever the reason is or who they are to go down well you my friend you 've came to the right place 
 if you want your business competitors to go down well they can if you want your rivals to go offline  well they will not only that we are providing a 
 service or scheduled attack starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites to ten to fifty dollars per hour
  now i did actually pay one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website
  things got a bit tricky when i tried to expense it at the company  
 turns out that 's not cool 
 but regardless it 's amazing how many products and services are available now to cybercriminals for example  this testing platform 
 which enables the cybercriminals to test the quality of their viruses before they release them on the world 
  fee they can upload it and make sure everything is good
 but it goes further cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards
 to manage the distribution of their malicious code  this is the market leader
 in malware distribution the black hole exploit pack responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters  it comes with
  with technical installation guides  video setup routines and
 get this technical support you can email the cybercriminals and they 'll tell you how to set up your illegal hacking server  
 so let me show you what malicious code looks like today  what i 've got here is two systems an
  which i 've made look all matrix y and scary and a victim  which you might recognize from home or work 
 now normally these would be on different sides of the of the planet or of the internet but i 've put them side by side because it makes things much more interesting 
 now there are many ways you can get infected you will have come in contact with some of them  maybe some of you have received an email that says something like hi
  rumor has it was quite successful in china 's recent campaign against america  now
 there are many ways you can get infected i want to show you a couple of my favorites this is a little usb key 
 now how do you get a usb key to run in a business well you could try looking really cute
  case awkward and pathetic  
 so imagine this scenario  i walk into one of your businesses  looking very awkward and pathetic with a copy of my c v which i 've covered in coffee  
 and i ask the receptionist to plug in this usb key and print me a new one  
 so let 's have a look here on my victim computer what i 'm going to do
  after a couple of seconds things start to happen on the computer on their own usually a bad sign 
 this would of course normally happen in a couple of seconds really really quickly  but i 've kind of slowed it down so you can actually see the attack occurring 
 malware is very boring otherwise  so this is writing out the malicious code and a few seconds later 
  get some interesting new text now
 if i place the mouse cursor over it this is what we call a command prompt  and using this we can navigate around the computer  
 we can access your documents your data you can turn on the webcam that can be very embarrassing or just to really prove a point we can launch programs like my personal favorite the windows
  so isn 't it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation let me show you how most malware is now distributed today  
 what i 'm going to do is open up a website that i wrote 
 it 's a terrible website it 's got really awful graphics  and it 's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website
  many of you will have used something a bit like this before unfortunately when this was implemented the developer was slightly inebriated
 and managed to forget all of the secure coding practices he had learned  so let 's imagine that our attacker  called evil hacker
 just for comedy value  inserts something a little nasty  
 this is a script it 's code which will be interpreted on the webpage  so i 'm going to submit this post and then on my victim
  computer i 'm going to open up the web browser and browse to my website
 notice that after a couple of seconds  i get redirected that website address at the top there which you can just about see
 the browser crashes as it hits one of
  this is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software  
 and it will go through and it will scan the system have a look at what its popping up here it creates some very serious alerts oh look a child porn proxy server  we really should clean that up 
 what 's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access
  when the scan finishes they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses you have to register the product 
 now i liked it better when viruses were free 
 people now pay cybercriminals money to run viruses  which i find utterly bizarre  
 so anyway let me change pace a little bit  chasing two hundred and fifty thousand pieces of
  malware a day is a massive challenge and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line you 'll note here so i
 want to talk to you briefly
 about a group of hackers we tracked for a year
 and actually found and this is a rare treat in our job 
  people from facebook independent researchers guys from sophos  so here we have a couple of documents
 which our cybercriminals had uploaded to a cloud service kind of like dropbox or skydrive like many of you might use 
 at the top you 'll notice a section of source code 
 what this would do is send the cybercriminals a text message
 every day telling them how much money they 'd made that day so
  kind of cybercriminal billings report if you will 
 if you look closely you 'll notice a series of what are russian telephone numbers 
 now that 's obviously interesting because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals 
 down below  highlighted in red in the other section of source code is this bit leded
  that 's a username kind of like you might have on twitter  
 so let 's take this a little further there are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded 
 lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference 
 an interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones is that when you take a photo it embeds gps data about where that photo was taken 
 in fact i 've been spending a lot of time on internet dating sites recently  
 obviously for
  research purposes  and i 've noticed that about sixty percent
 of the profile pictures on internet dating sites contain the gps coordinates of where the photo was taken  
 which is kind of scary because you wouldn 't give out your home address to lots of strangers  but we 're happy to give away our gps coordinates to plus or minus
  fifteen meters 
 and our cybercriminals had done the same thing  
 so here 's a photo which resolves to st petersburg  we then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool 
 we used google 
 using the email address the telephone number and the gps data 
 on the left you see an advert for a bmw that one of our cybercriminals is selling 
 on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens
 one of these was more stereotypical for me a little more searching and here 's our cybercriminal 
 imagine 
 these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely  imagine what you could find about each of the people in this room a bit more searching through the profile and there 's a photo of their office they were working on the third floor 
 and you can also see some photos from his business companion where
 he has a taste in a certain kind of image it
 turns out he 's a member of the russian adult webmasters federation  but this is where our investigation starts to slow down 
 the cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well  
 and herein is the greatest lesson of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now 
 our friends our families and our colleagues
  colleagues
 can break our security even when we do the right things 
 this is mobsoft one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned and an interesting thing about mobsoft is the 50 percent owner
 of this posted a job advert and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers
  this woman was maria  
 and maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals 
 and it 's kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really really insecure 
 by the end of the investigation where you can read the full  27 page report at that link we had photos of the cybercriminals even
  christmas party when they were out on an outing that 's right cybercriminals do have
 christmas parties as it turns out now you
 're probably wondering what happened to these guys let me come back to that in just a minute i
 want to change pace to one last little demonstration a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic  
 but is interesting in exposing how much information we 're all giving away  and it 's relevant because it applies to us as a ted audience
 this is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately
  many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks you do it every time you take out your
 iphone or your blackberry and connect
 to something like tedattendees  but what you might not know
  is that you 're also beaming out a list of networks you 've previously connected to even when you 're not using wireless actively  
 so i ran a little scan i was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals
 who wouldn 't be so concerned by law  and here you can see my mobile device  okay so you can see a list of wireless networks tedattendees
  which i think is a great name  sophos visitors sansemea companies i work with loganwifi that 's in boston hiltonlondon
 we called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out which is quite fun  this is how geeks party  
  so let 's make this a little bit more interesting let 's talk about you
 twenty three percent of you have been to starbucks recently and used the wireless network  
 things get more interesting forty six percent of you i could link to a business xyz employee network  
 this isn 't an exact science but it gets pretty accurate 
 seven hundred and sixty one of you i could identify
  a hotel you 'd been to recently  absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe two hundred and thirty four of you well  i know where you live 
 your wireless network name is so unique that i was able to pinpoint it using data available openly on the internet with no hacking or clever clever tricks  
 and i should mention as well that
 some of you do use your names james
  and two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity  
 so something for you to think about 
 as we adopt these new applications and mobile devices as we play with these shiny new toys 
 how much are we trading off convenience for privacy and security 
 next time you install something look at the settings and ask
  is this information that i want to share would someone be able to abuse it 
 we also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool  
 you see technology 's changing at a staggering rate and that two hundred and fifty thousand pieces of malware
 won 't stay the same for long there 's a very concerning trend
 that whilst many people coming out of schools now are much more
  know how to use technology fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects to know how that technology works under the covers 
 in the u k a sixty percent reduction since two thousand and three and there are similar statistics all over the world  
 we also need to think about the legal issues in this area the cybercriminals i talked about despite theft of
  millions of dollars actually still haven 't been arrested and at this point possibly never will 
 most laws are national in their implementation despite cybercrime conventions where the internet is borderless and international 
  by definition  countries do not agree  which makes this area exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective 
  my biggest ask is this 
 you see you 're going to leave here and you 're going to see some astonishing stories in the news you 're going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying scary things 
 however ninety nine percent of it works
 because people fail to do
  so my ask is this 
 go online find these simple best practices  
 find out how to update and patch your computer get a secure password make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online  
 find these resources  apply them 
 the internet is a fantastic resource for business for political expression for art and for learning 
 help me and the security community
  make life much much more difficult for cybercriminals  thank you
