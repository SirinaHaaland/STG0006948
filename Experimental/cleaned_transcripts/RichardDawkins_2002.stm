  is the music i 've chosen for my funeral and you
  feel anything but
 if i could i would feel triumphal at having lived at all and at having lived on this splendid planet  and having been given the opportunity
 to understand something about why i was here
 in the first place before not being here can
  like everybody else i was entranced yesterday by the animal session  robert full and
 frans lanting and others
  the beauty of the things that they showed the only slight jarring note was when jeffrey katzenberg said of
 the mustang the most splendid creatures that god put on this earth
 that he didn 't really mean that  but in this country at the moment you can 't be too careful 
 laughter i 'm a biologist and the central theorem of our subject  
 the theory of design darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection 
 in professional circles
  but in non professional circles within america  it arouses so much hostility 
 it 's fair to say that american biologists are in a state of war  
 the war is so worrying at present with court cases coming up in one state after another that i felt i had to say something about it
  if you want to know what i have to say about darwinism itself  i 'm afraid you 're going to have to look at my books  which you won 't find in the bookstore outside 
 contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism called intelligent
  there 's nothing new about id  it 's just creationism under another name rechristened i choose the word advisedly 
 for tactical political reasons the arguments of so called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again since darwin down to the present day 
 there is an effective
 evolution lobby coordinating the fight
  on behalf of science and i try to do all i can to help them 
 but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists  
 they see us as rocking the boat and
 you can understand why creationists lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case  fall back on the popular phobia
  phobia against atheism  
 teach your children evolution in biology class and they 'll soon move on to drugs grand larceny and sexual 
 in fact of course  educated theologians from the pope down are firm in their support
  finding darwin 's god by kenneth miller is one of the most effective attacks on intelligent design that i know
 and it 's all the more effective because it 's written by a devout christian people like kenneth miller could be called a godsend to the evolution lobby 
 because they expose the lie that evolutionism is as a matter of fact tantamount to atheism people like me on the other hand rock the boat
 but here i want to say something nice about creationists it 's not a thing i often do so listen carefully 
 i think they 're right about one thing i think they 're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion 
 i 've already said that many individual evolutionists like the pope are also religious but i think they 're deluding themselves  i believe a true understanding of darwinism
 is deeply corrosive to religious faith  
 now it may sound as though i 'm about to preach atheism  
 and i want to reassure you that that 's not what i 'm going to do 
 in an audience as sophisticated as this one that would be preaching to the choir 
 no what i want to urge upon you
 instead what i want to urge upon you is militant atheism 
 but that 's putting it too negatively
 if i was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith  i would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science
  science generally but evolution in particular to inspire and enthrall  precisely because it is atheistic  
 now  the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things 
 statistical improbability in the direction
 of good design
  complexity is another word for this the standard creationist argument there is only one they 're all reduced to this one
 takes off from a statistical improbability living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance therefore they must have had a designer 
 this argument of course shoots itself in the foot any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself and that 's before we even
  start on the other things he 's expected to do 
 like forgive sins bless marriages listen to prayers favor our side in a war 
 disapprove of our sex lives and so on complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to
  and you can 't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex thereby simply compounding the problem darwinian natural selection
 is so stunningly elegant
 because it solves the problem
 of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity  
 essentially it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual
  point that the elegance of darwinism is corrosive to religion  precisely because it is so elegant so parsimonious so powerful 
 so economically powerful  
 it has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge  
 the god theory is not just a bad theory it turns out to be in principle incapable
 of doing the job required of it  so returning to tactics and the evolution lobby i want to argue that rocking the boat
 may be
 just the right thing to do my approach to attacking creationism is unlike
 the evolution lobby my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole
 and at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion  
 and i 'm going to do so in the words of the late douglas adams a dear friend who if he never came to ted  certainly should have been invited richard saul wurman 
 he was richard dawkins he was good  i thought he must have been 
 he begins this speech which was tape recorded in cambridge shortly before he died
 he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof and then he goes on i quote 
 religion doesn 't seem to work like that it has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call ' sacred ' or ' holy '
 what it means is here is an idea or a notion that you 're not allowed to say anything bad about 
 you 're just not why not
 because you 're not 
 why should it be that it 's perfectly legitimate to support the republicans or democrats this model of economics versus that versus that macintosh instead of windows  
 but to have an opinion about how the universe began about who created the universe no that 's holy 
 so we 're used to not challenging religious ideas
 's very interesting how much of a furor richard creates when he does it he meant me not that one 
 everybody gets absolutely frantic about it  because you 're not allowed to say these things 
 yet when you look at it rationally there 's no reason why those ideas shouldn 't be as open to debate as any other except
  that we 've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn 't be and that 's the end of the quote from douglas 
 in my view not only is science corrosive to religion religion is corrosive
 to science  it teaches people to be satisfied with trivial supernatural
 and blinds them
  to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp it teaches them to accept authority  revelation
 and faith  instead of always insisting on evidence 
 there 's douglas adams  magnificent picture from his book last chance to see now there 's a typical
 scientific journal the quarterly review of biology and i 'm going to put together as guest editor
  a special issue on the question did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs and the first paper
 is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence iridium layer at the k t boundary and potassium argon dated crater in yucatan  indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs perfectly ordinary scientific paper  
  the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction
 that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs 
 it has been privately revealed to professor huxtane that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs
  and unquestioning faith that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs 
 professor hawkins
 has promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal hawkinsians
 that an asteroid
  a reporter asked george bush sr whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists mr bush 's reply
  has become infamous 
 no i don 't know that atheists should be considered citizens  nor should they be considered patriots  this is one nation under god 
 bush 's bigotry was not an isolated mistake blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal he really meant it more to the point
  he knew it posed no threat to his election
 quite the contrary  democrats as well as republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected 
 both parties invoke one nation under god 
 what would thomas jefferson have said
  you can 't help making the comparison 
 in practice 
  what is an atheist an atheist is just somebody who feels about yahweh
  been said before we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in 
 some of us just go one god further 
 and however we define
  it 's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic unelectable
  an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as mr hitler or miss beelzebub  
 and that all stems from the perception of atheists as
 some kind of
  natalie angier wrote a rather sad piece in the new yorker saying how lonely she felt as an atheist  she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority  but actually how do
 american atheists stack up numerically  
 the latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading  christianity of course takes a massive lion 's share of the population with nearly one hundred and sixty million  
 but
 what would you think was the second largest group
  convincingly outnumbering jews
 with two point eight million muslims at one point one million hindus buddhists and all other religions put together  
 the second largest group with nearly thirty million  is the one described as 
 or secular 
 you can 't help wondering why vote seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of for example the jewish lobby
  seems to owe its very existence to the american jewish vote while at the same time consigning the 
 to political oblivion 
 this secular non religious vote  if properly mobilized is nine times as numerous as the jewish vote 
 why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle
  so much for quantity  how about quality  is there any correlation positive or negative between intelligence
 and tendency to be religious [ them folks misunderestimated me ] 
 the survey that i quoted which is
 but a recent article by paul  g bell in the mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind  mensa as you know is an international organization for people with very high
  belief and one 's intelligence or educational level all but four found an inverse connection 
 that is the higher one 's intelligence or educational level  the less one is likely to be religious well i haven 't seen the original forty two studies and i can 't comment on
 that that meta analysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines  and i know that there are if i could put a little plug here there are people in this
  audience
 easily capable of financing
 a massive research survey to settle the question  
 and i put the suggestion up for what it 's worth  
 but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group namely top scientists
  by election to the national academy of sciences and among this select group  belief in a personal god
 dropped to a shattering seven percent 
 about twenty percent are agnostic the rest could fairly be called atheists similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality among biological scientists the figure is even lower 
 five point five percent
  only believe in god  physical scientists it 's seven point five percent  
 i 've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields such as history or philosophy  but i 'd be surprised if they were different 
 so we 've reached a truly remarkable situation a grotesque mismatch between the american intelligentsia
 and the american electorate
  a philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe which is held by the vast majority of top american scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally 
 is so abhorrent to the american electorate
 that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it
 in public if i 'm right this means that high office in the greatest country in the world
 is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it
 the intelligentsia unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs to put it bluntly american political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest
  i 'm not a citizen of this country so i hope it won 't be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done and i
 've already hinted what that something is from what i 've seen of ted i think this may be the ideal place to launch it  
 again i fear it will cost money  we need a
  this could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago  although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will 
 in most cases people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists on the contrary  they 'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people who could serve as decent role models for
  your children  the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product  the kinds of people who are sitting in this room 
 there should be a snowball effect a positive feedback such that the more names we we have the more we get 
 there could be non linearities threshold effects when a critical
  mass has been obtained there 's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment and again it will need money  
 i suspect that the word atheist itself
 contains or remains a stumbling block
 far out of proportion to what it actually means  and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves 
 so what other words might be used to smooth the path oil the
  sugar the pill 
 darwin himself preferred agnostic and not only out of loyalty to his friend huxley who coined the term 
 darwin said i have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a god  
 i think that generally an ' agnostic  ' would be the most correct description of my state of mind 
 he even became uncharacteristically tetchy with edward aveling
  militant atheist who failed to persuade darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism incidentally giving rise to a fascinating myth that karl marx tried to dedicate das kapital to darwin which he didn 't it was actually edward aveling 
 what happened was that aveling 's mistress was marx 's daughter  
 and when
 both darwin and marx were dead marx 's papers became muddled up
  with aveling 's papers and a letter from darwin saying my dear sir  thank you very much but i don 't want you to dedicate your book to me was mistakenly
 supposed to be addressed to marx  and that that gave rise to this whole myth which you 've probably heard it 's a sort of urban myth that marx tried to dedicate
  but why should you be so aggressive
  darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia  but that ordinary people were not quote ripe for it 
 which is of course our old friend the don 't rock the boat argument  
 it 's not recorded whether aveling told darwin to come down off his high horse 
 laughter but in any case that was more than one hundred years ago you 'd think we might have grown up since then 
  a friend an intelligent lapsed jew who incidentally observes the sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity  describes himself as a 
 agnostic he won 't call himself an atheist because it 's in principle impossible to
 prove a negative but agnostic on its own might suggest that god 's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood
  my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy  but
 it isn 't very likely is it  
 like god  
 hence the phrase tooth fairy agnostic bertrand russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about mars 
 you would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about mars  but that doesn 't mean you treat the
  likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non existence the list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn 't stop at tooth fairies and teapots it 's infinite  
 if you want to believe one particular one of them unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or yahweh
 the onus is on you to say why the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not 
 we who are atheists
  but we don 't bother to say so and this is why my friend uses
 tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist  
 nonetheless if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly we 're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than
  this has the advantage of a worldwide network of well organized associations and journals and things already in place my problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism one of the things 
  we 've learned from darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins some close some distant and
  but that also has problems of confusion because darwin would have thought naturalist naturalist means of course as opposed to supernaturalist and it is used sometimes
 darwin would have been confused by the
 other sense of naturalist which he was of course  and i suppose
 there might be others who would confuse it with nudism such people
 might be those belonging to the british lynch mob  which last year
 attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile 
 laughter i think the best of the available alternatives for atheist is simply non theist it lacks the strong connotation that there 's definitely no god  and it could therefore easily be embraced by
  when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein
 use the word god they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious part of physics which we don 't yet understand
  the same phobic  hysterical
 responses  
 but i think actually the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word atheism itself  precisely because it is a taboo word  
 carrying frissons of hysterical phobia 
 critical mass may be harder
  if we did achieve it with that dread word atheist itself the political impact would be even greater now
 i said that if i were religious i 'd be very afraid of evolution i 'd go further i would fear science in general if properly understood  
 and this is because the scientific worldview
 is so much more exciting
  more poetic more filled
 with sheer wonder
 than anything in the  poverty stricken arsenals of the religious imagination 
 as carl sagan another recently dead hero put it 
 how is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded ' this is better than we thought 
 the universe is much bigger than our prophet said grander more subtle more elegant
  ' instead they say ' no no no my god is a little god  and i want him to stay that way '
 a religion old or new that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped
 by the conventional faiths
  elite audience  and i would therefore expect about ten percent of you to be religious 
 many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief
 that we should respect religion  
 but i also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as i do 
 if you 're one of them
 and of course many of you may not be but if you are one of them  i 'm asking you to stop being polite come out and say so 
 and if you happen to be rich  give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference 
 the religious lobby in this country is massively financed
 by foundations to say nothing of all the tax benefits
 by foundations such as the templeton foundation
 and the discovery institute we need an 
 to step forward 
 if my books sold as well as stephen hawking 's books  instead of only as well as richard dawkins ' books 
 i 'd do it myself 
 people are always going on
  it changed me  let 's all stop being so damned respectful thank you very much
