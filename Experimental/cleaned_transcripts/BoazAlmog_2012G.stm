  the phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum
  locking and the object
 that was levitating here is called a superconductor 
 superconductivity is a quantum state of matter  and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature 
 now  it 's quite an old phenomenon it was discovered one hundred years ago  however only recently due to several
  technological advancements we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation
 and quantum locking  
 so a superconductor is defined by two properties the first is zero electrical resistance  
 and the second
 is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor
  that sounds complicated right  but what is electrical resistance  so  electricity is the flow of electrons
 inside a material  
 and these electrons while flowing they collide with the atoms  and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy  
 and they dissipate this energy in the form of heat  and you know that effect
 however inside a superconductor there are no collisions 
 so there is no energy dissipation  
 it 's quite remarkable think about it 
 in classical physics there is always some friction some energy loss but not here  because it is a quantum effect  
 but that 's not all
  because superconductors
 don 't like magnetic fields 
 so a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside  and it has the means to do that
 by circulating currents now the combination of both effects
 the expulsion of magnetic
  resistance
 is exactly a superconductor 
 but the picture isn 't always perfect as we all know and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor 
 now  under proper conditions which we have here these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor
 and
 these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor 
 they come in discrete quantities  why because it is a quantum phenomenon it 's quantum physics  
 and it turns out that they behave like quantum particles 
 in this movie here you can see how they flow one by one discretely this is
 strands of magnetic field
  not particles but they behave like particles  
 so this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking  but what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field  
 well first there are strands of magnetic field left inside
  but now the superconductor doesn 't like them moving around  because their movements
 dissipate energy which breaks the superconductivity state 
 so what it actually does it locks these strands which are called fluxons  
 and it locks these fluxons in place  
 and by doing that what it actually does
 is locking itself in place why
  movement
 of the superconductor will change their place will change their configuration  so we get quantum locking and let me show you
 how this works i have here a superconductor which i
 wrapped up so it 'd stay cold long enough  and when i place it on top of a regular magnet  it just stays
 locked in midair now 
 this is not just
 levitation it 's not just repulsion i can rearrange the fluxons  and it will be locked in this new configuration 
 like this or move it slightly to the right or to the left 
  of course i can turn it upside down  and it will remain locked now now that we understand that this
  levitation is actually locking yeah
 we understand that 
 you won 't be surprised to hear that if i take this circular magnet
 in which the magnetic field is the same all around 
 the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet  why because as long as it rotates 
 the locking
 is maintained you see i can adjust and i can rotate the superconductor we have frictionless motion it is still
  levitating  but can move freely all around  
 so we have quantum locking and
 we can levitate it on top of this magnet  but how many fluxons how many magnetic strands
 are there in a single disk like this well we can calculate it and it turns out quite a lot one hundred billion strands
  of magnetic field inside this
 disk but that 's not the amazing part yet because there is something i haven 't told you yet 
 and yeah  the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here
 is only half a micron thick  it 's extremely thin  and this extremely thin layer
  able to levitate
 more than seventy thousand times its own weight  
 it 's a remarkable effect it 's very strong 
 now i can extend this circular magnet  and make whatever track i want 
 for example  i can make
 a large circular rail here
 and when i place the superconducting disk on top of this rail 
 it moves freely 
 and again that 's not all i can adjust its position like this and rotate
 and it freely moves in this new position and
 i can even try a new thing  let 's try it for the first time i can take this disk
 and put it here  and while it stays here don 't move
  it 's quantum locking not levitation 
  while i 'll let it circulate for a little more let me tell you a little bit about superconductors now 
 laughter so
 we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors so we can use them to produce
  such as needed in mri machines particle accelerators and so on but we can also store energy
 using superconductors  because we have no dissipation  
 and we could also produce power cables to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations imagine you could back up
 a single power station with a
  but what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking  
 well  let me answer this simple question by giving you an example  
 imagine
 you would have
 a disk similar to the one i have here in my hand three inch diameter with a single difference the superconducting layer
  instead of being half a micron thin  being two millimeters thin quite thin this 
 superconducting layer could hold one thousand kilograms a small car in my hand
