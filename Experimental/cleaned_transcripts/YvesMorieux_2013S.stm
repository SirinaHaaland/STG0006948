  have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas why is productivity so disappointing
 in all the companies where i work i have worked with more than
  the internet 
 enigma number two 
 why is there so little engagement at work why do people feel so miserable even actively disengaged  
 disengaging their colleagues acting against the
 interest of their
  the celebration the people initiatives  
 the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams  
 at the beginning i thought there was a chicken and egg issue because people are less engaged they are less productive or vice versa because they are less
  we put more pressure and they are less engaged  but as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates in fact to the basic pillars of management 
 the way we organize is based on two pillars  the hard structure processes systems  the soft feelings  sentiments interpersonal relationships 
 traits  personality
  goes through a cultural transformation program  it chooses these two pillars 
  now we try to refine them  we try to combine them  the real issue is and this is the answer to the two enigmas these pillars are obsolete  
 everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their
  do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business  the hard approach basically is that you start from strategy 
  systems kpis scorecards  committees headquarters  hubs clusters  you name it i forgot all the 
  committees middle offices and interfaces  what happens basically on the left you have more complexity the new complexity of business
 we need quality  cost reliability speed and every time there is a new requirement we use the same approach we create dedicated structure 
  processed systems basically to deal with the new complexity of business  the hard approach
 in the organization 
  any new requirement you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement what happens when the new requirement emerges  some years ago a new requirement appeared on
  the marketplace  the length of the warranty period so therefore the new requirement is repairability making cars easy to repair otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the light if you have to remove the engine
 to access the lights the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours  and the warranty budget will
  what percentage of these people is variable compensation twenty percent at most
  most  divided by 
  makes a difference of zero point eight percent 
 what difference did it make in their actions their choices to simplify zero  
 but what occurs for zero impact  mr repairability process scorecard evaluation 
 coordination with the twenty five other coordinators to have
  in front of the new complexity of business  the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines 
 it is basically the interplay  
 how the parts work together  the connections  
 the interactions  the synapses  it is not the skeleton of boxes  it is the nervous system of
  whenever people cooperate  they use less resources in everything 
 you know the repairability issue is a cooperation problem 
 when you design cars please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages 
 when we don 't cooperate we need more time more equipment
 more systems  more teams we need when procurement supply chain manufacturing don 't cooperate we need more stock more inventories more working capital who will pay for that 
 shareholders  customers no they will refuse so who is left  
 the employees  who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation
 burnout  they are overwhelmed  accidents no wonder they disengage  
 how do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation 
 the hard in banks when there is a problem between the back office and the front office they don 't cooperate what is the solution they create
  what happens one year later instead of one problem between the back and the front now i have two problems between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front  plus i have to pay for the middle office  
 the hard approach is unable to foster cooperation it can only add new boxes new bones in the skeleton 
 the soft approach to make people cooperate we need to make them
  improve interpersonal feelings the more people like each other the more they will cooperate it is totally wrong  
 it is even counterproductive  look at home i have two tvs  why precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife 
 not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife and why i try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because i love my wife  
 if i didn 't love my wife one tv would be enough
 you will watch my favorite football game if you are not happy  how is the book or the door 
 the more we like each other  the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs and we go for a second tv or we escalate the decision above for
  have to remove the engine to access the lights
  the new complexity of business
