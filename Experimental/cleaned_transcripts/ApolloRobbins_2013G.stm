  do you think it 's possible to control someone 's attention  
 even more than that what about predicting human behavior i think those are interesting ideas for me that would be the
  actually kind of an evil way of approaching it  but for myself in the past i 've spent the last twenty years studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way  
 picking pockets  
 when we think of misdirection we think of something as looking off to the side  when actually the things right in front of us are often the hardest to see the things that you look at every day that you 're blinded to 
 for example how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now  
 great double check make sure you still have them
 i was doing some shopping before  
 you 've looked at them a few times today but i 'll ask you a question without looking at it directly yet 
 can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner  
 bring them out check and see how accurate you were how 'd
 you do show of hands did we get it  now that you 're done
  down every phone has something in common no matter how you organize the icons you still have a clock on the front so without looking at your phone what time was it you
 just looked at your clock right interesting idea let 's take that a step further with a game of trust close your eyes
 i realize i 'm asking you to do that while you just heard there 's a pickpocket
  you 've been watching me for about thirty seconds with your eyes closed  what am i wearing  
 make your best guess what color is my shirt  what color is my tie now open your eyes show of hands were you right
 interesting isn 't it  some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others it seems  but i have a different theory about that that model
  they have fancy models of attention posner 's trinity model of attention for me i like to think of it very simple like a surveillance system  it 's kind of
 like you have all these fancy sensors  and inside your brain is a little security guard for me i like to call him frank 
 so frank is sitting at a desk he 's got lots of cool information in front of him high tech equipment he 's got cameras he 's got a little phone that he can pick up listen to the ears 
 all these senses all these perceptions  but attention is what steers your perceptions
 it 's what controls your reality  it 's the gateway to the mind if you don 't attend to something you can 't be aware of it  
 but ironically you can attend to something without being aware of it
 for example the cocktail effect you 're in a party having conversations with someone and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that 
 now for my job i have to play with techniques to exploit this to
 play with your attention as a limited resource so if i could
 control how you spend your attention if i could maybe steal your attention through a distraction now  instead of doing it like misdirection and throwing it off to the side  instead what i choose to focus on is frank 
 to be able to play with the frank inside your head your security guard and get you instead of focusing on your external senses  
 just to go internal for a second so if i ask you to access a memory like 
 what is that
  happened do you have a wallet do you have an american express in your wallet  and when i do that your frank turns around 
 he accesses the file he has to rewind the tape what 's interesting is he can 't rewind the tape at the same time that he 's trying to process new data 
 this sounds like a good theory but i could talk for a long time tell you lots of things and a portion of them may be true 
 but i think it 's better if i tried to show that to you here live  
 bit of shopping just hold still where you are 
 hello  how are you it
 's lovely to see you wonderful job onstage lovely watch it doesn 't come off very well do you have a ring as well  
 good just taking inventory you 're like a buffet hard to tell where to start so many great things hi how are you good to see you hi 
  just right where you are you 're married you follow directions well nice to meet you sir  you don 't have a lot in your pockets anything down  here  
 hopefully so have a seat there you go you 're doing well hi sir how are you
 good to see you sir you have a ring a watch do you have a wallet on you joe i don 't ar well we 'll find one for you  come on up this way joe give joe a round of applause come on up joe
  all right let 's try that can you stand right over this way for me  turn around and let 's see if i give you something that belongs to me this is just something
 i have a poker chip hold out your hand for me  watch it
  is a task for you to focus on you have your money in your front pocket 
  put my hand in your pocket i 'm not ready for that kind of commitment  once a guy had a hole in his pocket and that was rather traumatizing for
  you very much i 'll cheat if you give me a chance make it harder for me  just use your hand  grab my wrist but squeeze squeeze firm did you see it go joe no 
 ar no it 's not here open your hand while we 're focused on the hand it 's sitting on your shoulder 
 go ahead and take it off now let 's try that again 
  it 's back on your shoulder  you were focused on your hand distracted  while you were watching i couldn 't get your watch off yet you had something inside your
  just shopping this trick 's more about the timing i 'm going to try to push it inside your hand put your other hand on top would you it
 's amazingly obvious now isn 't it looks a lot like the watch i was wearing
  your other hand on 
 top if you 're watching this little token this obviously has become a little target like a red herring if we watch this kind of close it looks like it goes away it
 's not back on your shoulder  it falls out of the air lands right back in the hand did you see it go yeah funny we
 've
 got a little guy he 's union works up there all day  if i do it slowly it goes straight
  it lands by your pocket is it in this pocket sir don 't reach in your pocket that 's a different show  
 that 's rather strange they have shots for that
 can i show them rather bizarre is this yours sir i have no idea how that works we 'll send that over there i need help with this one step over this way for me
 don 't run away you had something down by your pants pocket i was checking mine i couldn 't find everything but i noticed you had something here can i feel the outside for a moment down here i noticed this is this something of
  that 's a shrimp j yeah i 'm saving it for later ar you 've
 entertained all of these people in a wonderful way  better than you know  so we 'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift 
 hopefully it matches his taste  we have a couple of other things a little bit of cash and we have a few other things these all belong to you  along with a big round of
  same question i asked you before  but this time you don 't have to close your eyes  what am i wearing
  like i said it shapes your reality  so i guess i 'd like to pose that question to you if you could control somebody 's attention what would you do with it
