  as a lover of human anatomy i 'm so excited that we 're finally putting our bodies at the center of focus 
 through practices such as preventive medicine  patient empowerment and self monitoring down to now obsessing over every single step we take in a day
  of this works to promote a healthy connection between ourselves and our bodies  
 despite all this focus on the healthy self general public knowledge of the anatomical self
 is lacking many people don 't know the location of their vital organs or even how they function and that 's because human anatomy
 is a difficult and
  subject to learn how many of you here made it through anatomy 
 wow  good most of you are in medicine  
 i like you spent countless hours memorizing hundreds of structures something no student of anatomy could do
 without the help
 of visuals because at the end of the day  whether you remember every little structure or not
  medical illustrations are what makes studying anatomy so intriguing in looking at them we 're actually viewing a manual of our very selves  
 but what happens when we 're done studying 
 these beautiful illustrations are then shut back into the pages of a medical textbook or an app referenced only when
  and for the public medical illustrations may only be encountered passively on the walls of a doctor 's office 
 from the beginnings of modern medicine medical illustration and therefore anatomy have existed primarily within the realm
 of medical education  yet there 's something fascinating happening right now artists are breaking anatomy out of the confines of the medical world
  and are thrusting it into the public space for the past nine years i have been cataloguing and sharing this rise in anatomical art with the public
 all from my perspective as a medical illustrator  
 but before i get into showing you how artists are reclaiming anatomy today it 's important to understand how art
 influenced anatomy in the past 
 now anatomy is by its very nature a visual science and the first anatomists to understand this lived during the renaissance they relied
  on artists to help advertise their discoveries to their peers in the public  and this drive to not only teach
 but also to entertain
 resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations anatomy
 was caught in a struggle between science art and culture that lasted for over five hundred years
 artists rendered dissected cadavers
 as alive posed in these humorous anatomical stripteases imagine seeing that in your textbooks today  
 they also showed them as very much dead unwillingly stripped of their skin 
 disembodied limbs were often posed in
  literal still lives
  and some illustrations even included pop culture references this is clara a famous rhinoceros that was traveling europe in the 
 at a time when seeing a rhino was an exciting rarity  including her in this illustration was akin to celebrity sponsorship today 
 the introduction of color
 then brought a whole new
 depth and clarity to anatomy that made it stunning 
 by the early 20th century the perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck with the emergence of medical illustrators  
 they created a universal representation of anatomy something that was neither alive nor dead 
 that was free from those influences of artistic culture 
  focus on no frills accuracy was precisely for the benefit of medical education  and this
 is what we get to study from today  
 but why is it that medical illustration both past and present captures our imaginations  
 now we
 are innately tuned into the beauty of the human body and medical illustration is
  still art  
 nothing can elicit an emotional response from joy to complete disgust more than the human body 
 and today  artists armed with that emotion are grasping anatomy from the medical world and are reinvigorating it through art
 in the most imaginative
  a perfect example of this is spanish contemporary artist fernando vicente  he takes 19th century anatomical illustrations
 of the male body
 and envelops them
 in a female sensuality 
 the women in his paintings taunt us to view beyond their surface anatomy  
 thereby introducing a strong femininity that was previously lacking in the history of anatomical representation
 artistry
 can also be seen in the repair and recovery of the human body this is an x ray of a woman who fractured and dislocated her ankle in a roller skating accident 
 as a tribute to her trauma  she commissioned  montreal based architect federico carbajal
 to construct a wire
 wire sculpture of her damaged lower leg 
 now  notice those bright red screws magnified in the sculpture 
 these are the actual surgical screws used in reconstructing her ankle 
 it 's medical hardware that 's been repurposed as art  
 people often ask me how i choose the art that i showcase online or feature in gallery shows  and for me
  it 's a balance between the technique
 and a concept that pushes the boundaries of anatomy as a way to know thyself which is why the work of michael reedy struck me 
 his serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor for instance take a look at her face 
 notice those red marks michael manifests the consuming insecurity of a skin condition
  as these maniacal cartoon monsters annoying and out of control in the background 
 on the mirrored figure  he renders the full anatomy and covers it in glitter  making it look like candy 
 by doing this michael downplays the common perception of anatomy
 so closely tied to just disease and death 
 now this next concept might not make much sense but human anatomy is no longer limited to humans
  when you were a child did you ever wish that your toys could come to life well jason freeny makes those dreams come true with his magical toy dissections 
 one might think that this would bring a morbid edge to one 's innocent childhood characters  
 but jason says of his dissections one thing i 've never seen in a child 's reaction to my work
  amazement and wanting to explore  fear of anatomy and guts is a learned reaction this
 also extends to politically and socially charged objects in noah scalin 's anatomy of war we see a gun
 dissected to reveal human organs  but if you look closely
  notice that it lacks a brain and if you keep looking you might also notice that noah has so thoughtfully placed the rectum
 at the business end of that gun barrel  
 now  this next artist i 've been following for many years  watching him excite the public about anatomy 
 danny quirk is a young artist who paints his subjects in the process
 he bends the rules of medical illustration by inserting a very dramatic light and shadow  and this creates a 3 d illusion
 that lends itself very well to painting directly
 on the human skin danny makes it look as if a person 's skin has actually been removed
  easily transitions into a medical illustration  
 now danny is currently traveling the world teaching anatomy to the public via his body paintings 
 which is why it was so shocking to find out that he was rejected from medical illustration programs  
 but he 's doing just fine 
 then there are artists who are extracting anatomy from both the medical world and the art world
  world and are placing it directly on the streets
  paints giant x rays of pop culture icons 
 his x rays show how culture can come to have an anatomy of its own and conversely how culture can become part of the anatomy of a person 
 you come to admire his work because reproducing x rays by hand
  let alone with spray paint is extremely difficult  but then again this is a street artist who also happens to hold a degree in applied chemistry 
 nychos an austrian street artist takes the term exploded view to a whole new level  splattering human and animal dissections on walls all over the world 
 influenced by comics and heavy metal nychos inserts a very youthful and enticing energy into anatomy that i just love
 street artists believe that art belongs to the public  
 and this street anatomy is so captivating because it is the furthest removed from the medical world 
 it forces you to look at it and confront your own perceptions about anatomy  whether you find it beautiful gross  
  like i do that it elicits these responses at all is due to our intimate and often changing relationship with it 
 all of the artists that i showed you here today referenced medical illustrations for their art  
 but for them anatomy isn 't just something to memorize  but a base from which to understand the human body on a meaningful level 
 to depict it in ways that we can relate whether it be through cartoons
  body painting
 or street art 
 anatomical art has the power to reach far beyond the pages of a medical textbook 
 to ignite an excitement in the public  and reinvigorate an enthusiasm in the medical world  
 ultimately
 connecting our innermost selves with our bodies
 through art  thank you
