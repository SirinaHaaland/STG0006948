  to do is say thank you
 to all of you the second thing i want to do is introduce my co author and dear friend and co teacher ken and i have been working together for almost forty
 years that 's ken sharpe over there
  among many people certainly me and most of the people i talk to a kind of collective dissatisfaction
 with the way things are working with the way our institutions run our kids ' teachers seem to be failing them 
 our doctors don 't know who the hell we are and they don 't have enough time for us we certainly can 't trust the bankers  and we certainly can 't trust the brokers
  they almost brought the entire financial system down  and even as we do our own work 
 all too often we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing
 and doing the expected thing or the required thing or the profitable
 thing so everywhere we look pretty much across the board we
 that the people we depend on don 't really have our interests at heart  
 or if they do have our interests at heart  we worry that they don 't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to
 to secure those interests they don 't understand us they don 't have the time to get to know us there are two kinds of responses that we
 make to this sort of general dissatisfaction 
 if things aren 't going right the first response is let 's make more rules  
 let 's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing  give teachers scripts
 to follow in the classroom  so even if they don 't know what they 're doing and don 't care about
  the welfare of our kids as long as they follow the scripts our kids will get educated 
 give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes so that you don 't need to rely on judges
 using their
 judgment instead all they have to do is look up on the list
 what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime impose limits on what credit card
  companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with 
 or
 or maybe and in addition to rules  let 's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that even if the people we deal with don 't particularly want
  to serve our interests it is in their interest to serve our interest the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing
 even out of pure selfishness  so we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score
 passing grades on these big test scores that are
  used to evaluate the quality of school systems 
 rules and incentives sticks and carrots we passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent 
 collapse there 's the dodd frank act there 's the new consumer financial protection agency that is temporarily being headed
 the way these financial services companies behave we
 'll see 
 in addition we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long term
 interests even of their own companies 
  if we find just the right incentives they 'll do the right thing as i said selfishly  and if we come up with the right rules and regulations they won 't drive us all over a cliff  
 and ken [ sharpe ] and i certainly know
 that you need to reign in the bankers if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is
  but what we believe and what we argue in the book is that there is no set of rules  no matter how detailed no matter how specific 
 no matter how carefully monitored and enforced there is no set of rules that will get us what we need 
 you design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system almost collapse can 't happen again it is naive 
  beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse you have blocked all possible
  ourselves against that 
 what we desperately need beyond or along with better rules and reasonably smart incentives is we need virtue  
 we need character 
 we need people who want to do the right thing and in particular the virtue that we need most of all
 is the virtue that aristotle called
 practical wisdom practical wisdom is the moral
 will
 to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is so aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked  
 and he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel
  problems problems that they hadn 't anticipated so one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the isle of lesbos  
 and they need to measure out round columns 
 well if you think about it it 's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler 
 so what do they do they fashion a novel
 solution to the problem they created a ruler that bends what we would call these days a tape measure
 a flexible rule a rule that bends  
 and aristotle said hah  they appreciated that sometimes to design
 rounded columns you need to bend the rule and aristotle said
 often in dealing with other people we need to bend the rules
  dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility
 that no set of rules can encompass
 wise people know when and how to bend the rules  
 wise people know how to improvise the way my co author ken and i talk about it they are kind of like jazz musicians the rules are like the notes on the page and
 that gets you started
  but then you dance around the notes on the page  coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players  
 so for aristotle the kind of
 moral craftsman and in interactions with people almost all the time it is this kind of flexibility that is required 
 a wise person knows when to bend the rules a wise person knows when to improvise and most important 
 a wise person does this improvising and  rule bending in the service of the right aims 
 if you are a rule bender and an improviser
 mostly to serve yourself what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people  so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in 
  the service of yourself  and so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and
  the master virtue so i 'll give you an example of wise practice in action 
 it 's the case of michael 
 michael 's a young guy  
 he had a pretty low wage job he was supporting his wife and a child and the child was going to parochial school 
 then he lost his
  he panicked about being able to support his family one night he drank a little too much  and he robbed a cab driver
 stole fifty dollars he robbed him at gunpoint  it was a toy gun
  he got caught  he got tried he got convicted  
 the pennsylvania sentencing guidelines
 required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of
  two years twenty four months  the judge on the case judge lois forer thought that this made no sense 
 he had never committed a crime before 
 he was a responsible husband and father  he had been faced with desperate circumstances all this would do is wreck a family 
 and so she improvised a sentence eleven months and not only that but release every day to go to work
 spend your night in jail  spend your day holding down a job  he did he served out his sentence he made restitution
 and found himself a new job and the family was
 united and it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life
 a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise
  judge but
 it turned out the prosecutor was not happy
 that judge forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own and so he appealed  
 and he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery  he did after all have a toy gun 
 the mandatory minimum sentence for
 armed robbery is five years  
 he won the appeal michael was sentenced to five years in prison 
 judge forer had to follow the law
  and by the way this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence so he was out and working
 at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail  judge forer did
  what she was required to do and then she quit the bench and michael
 disappeared  
 so that is an example both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant of course to make things better 
 now consider ms 
  a teacher in a texas elementary school 
 she found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids so that the school would reach the
 elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones and there are bonuses and various other treats that come
 if you beat the other schools  so here was the consultant
  's advice  first don 't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do 
 second  don 't waste your time on kids who can 't pass the test no matter what you do 
 third don 't waste your time on kids who moved into the district
 too late for their scores to be counted  focus all of
  your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble 
 the so called bubble kids kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing 
 so ms dewey heard this and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other
  like they were about to go play a football game for ms dewey this isn 't why she became a teacher 
 now ken and i are not naive and we understand that you need to have rules
  you need to have incentives people have to make a living  
 but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize
  and they demoralize professional activity in two senses  first they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity 
 judge forer quits and ms dewey in completely disheartened  
 and second they demoralize the activity itself  the very practice is demoralized  and the practitioners are demoralized  it creates
  when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing it creates people who are addicted to incentives that is to say it creates people who only do things for incentives 
 now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for thirty years  psychologists have known about the
 negative consequences of incentivizing everything for thirty years  we know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures  they stop caring about the drawing and care
  about the reward 
 if you reward kids for reading books they stop caring about what 's in the books and only care about how long they are 
 if you reward teachers for kids ' test scores they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation 
 if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures which is the current system they would do more if instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures
  they will do fewer what we want of course is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason namely to serve the welfare 
 of their patients psychologists have known this for decades  and it 's time for policymakers to start paying attention
  and it doesn 't have to be this way we think ken and i that there are real sources of hope 
 we identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws these are people
 who
 being forced to operate in a system that demands rule following and creates incentives find away around the rules find a way to subvert the rules  so there are teachers
 who have these scripts to follow  and they know that if they follow these scripts the kids will learn nothing  and so what they do is they follow the scripts  but they follow the scripts at double time
 and squirrel away little bits of extra time
 during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective  so these are little ordinary 
  and they 're incredibly admirable 
 but there 's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down  
 so canny outlaws are better than nothing but it 's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time more hopeful are people we call 
 these are people who are looking not
  dodge the system 's
 rules and regulations but to transform the system and we talk about several
 one in particular is a judge named robert russell and one day he was faced with the case of gary pettengill 
 pettengill was a  23 year old vet
 who had planned to make the army a career  but then he got a severe back injury in iraq  
  that forced him to take a medical discharge 
 he was married he had a third kid on the way  he suffered from ptsd in addition to the bad back and recurrent nightmares  and he had started using marijuana
 to ease some of the symptoms 
 he was only able to get part time work because of his back and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family  so he started selling marijuana 
 he was busted in a drug sweep 
 his family was kicked out of their
  apartment and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids  
 under normal sentencing procedures judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail time as a drug felon  
 but judge russell did have an alternative  
 and that 's because he was in a special court he was in a court called the veterans  ' court in the veterans
  court this was the first of its kind in the united states 
 judge russell created the veterans ' court it was a court only for veterans who had broken the law 
  and he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging 
 no one wanted non violent
  offenders and especially non violent offenders who were veterans to boot
 to be thrown into prison 
 they wanted to do something about what we all know namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system 
 and what the veterans ' court did was it treated each criminal as an individual  tried to get inside their problems tried to fashion responses to 
  their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves and didn 't forget about them once the judgment was made stayed with them followed up on them made
  sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump 
 there are now twenty two cities that have veterans ' courts like this why has the idea spread 
 well one reason is that
 judge russell has now seen one hundred and eight vets in his veterans ' court as of february of this year  and out of one hundred and eight
 guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison  none  none  anyone
 would
 glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record  so here 's is a system changer and it seems to be catching there 's a banker
  community bank that encouraged bankers i know this is hard to believe encouraged bankers who worked there to do well
 by doing good for their low income clients  the bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community 
 though their loan recipients were high risk by ordinary standards the default rate was extremely low  the bank was profitable
  the bankers stayed with their loan recipients they didn 't make loans and then sell the loans they serviced the loans  they made sure that their loan recipients were
 staying up with their payments  
 banking hasn 't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers even goldman sachs
 once used to serve clients  before it turned into an institution
 that serves only itself
  banking wasn 't always this way  and it doesn 't have to be this way  so there are examples like this in medicine
 doctors at harvard who are trying to transform medical education  so that you don 't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy which characterizes most medical 
  students in the course of their medical training and the way they do it is to give third year medical students patients who
  they follow for an entire year  so the patients are not organ systems  and they 're not diseases they 're people people with lives and in order to be an effective doctor you need to treat people 
  who have lives and not just disease in addition to which there 's an enormous amount of back and forth mentoring of one student by another of all the students by the doctors and the result is a generation we hope of doctors who do have time
 for the people they treat we 'll see  
 so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character
 and keep a profession true to its proper mission
 what aristotle would have called its proper telos  
 and ken and i believe that this is what practitioners actually want people want
  to be allowed to be virtuous  they want to have permission to do the right thing  they don 't want to feel like they need to take
 a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work 
 aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness  and
  there 's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy 
 and the two things that jump out in study after study i know this will come as a shock to all of you the two things that matter most to happiness are love
 and work 
 love 
 managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part 
 work  engaging in activities that are
  meaningful and satisfying if you have that good close relations with other people work that 's meaningful
 and fulfilling you don 't much need anything else well to love well
 and to work well you need wisdom rules and incentives don 't tell you how to be a good friend
  how to be a good parent how to be a good spouse 
 or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher 
 rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom indeed we argue there is no substitute for wisdom  
 and so practical wisdom
 does not require heroic acts of 
 on the part of
  in giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing to do right by others
 practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves thanks
