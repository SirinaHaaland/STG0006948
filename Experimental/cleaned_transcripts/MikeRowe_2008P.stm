  crew and i were called to a little town in colorado called craig it 's only a couple dozen square miles it 's in the rockies and the job in question was sheep rancher 
 my role on the show for those of you who haven 't seen it it 's pretty simple  i 'm an apprentice  and i work with the people who do the
  jobs in question and my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it 's like to be these people for one day in their life the job in question 
 herding sheep great we go to craig
 and
 we check into a hotel  and i realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute
  i never do any research at all but this is a touchy subject and i work for the discovery channel and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do and we certainly want to do it with
 a lot of respect for
 the animals so i call the humane society and i say look i 'm going to be castrating some lambs can you tell me the deal and they 're like
 like this only a little smaller this one was actually around the playing cards i got yesterday but
 it had a certain familiarity to it and i said well
 what exactly is the process and they said the band is applied to the tail  tightly and then another band is applied to the scrotum  tightly  
 blood flow is slowly retarded a week later the parts in question fall off great got it
 the  spca to confirm this they confirm it i also call peta just for fun and they don 't like it but they confirm it  ok that 's basically
 how you do it so the next day i go out and i 'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built and we go about the business of
 animal husbandry  melanie is the wife of albert albert is the
  shepherd in question melanie picks up the lamb 
 one hand on both legs on the right  likewise on the left 
 lamb goes on the post  she opens it up alright great albert goes in 
 i follow albert the crew is around  i always watch the process done the first time before i try it being an apprentice  you know  you do that 
 albert reaches in his pocket to pull out you know this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife 
  that 's not rubber at all you know and he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the rockies it was very 
 it was  it was impressive 
 in the space of about two seconds albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail right next to the
 butt of the lamb and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that i was
  a second later with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp and he pulled it toward him like so and he took the knife
 and he put it on the tip now you think you know what 's coming michael you don 't  ok 
 laughter he snips it  throws the tip over his shoulder  and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward and then his head dips down  obscuring my
  but what i hear is a slurping sound and a noise that sounds like velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and i am not even kidding 
 can we roll the video no i 'm kidding we don 't 
 i thought it best to talk in pictures  
 i do something now i 've never ever done on a dirty jobs shoot ever i say time out stop you guys know the show we use take
  we don 't do take two there 's no writing there 's no scripting there 's no nonsense we don 't fool around we don 't rehearse
 we shoot what we get i said stop this is nuts i mean 
 this is crazy
 we can 't do this 
 and albert 's like what and i 'm like i don 't know what just happened but there are testicles in this bucket and that 's not how we do it he said well that 's how we do it i said 
 why would you do it this way and before i even let him explain i said i want to do it the
  right way with the rubber bands and he says like the humane society i said yes like the humane society let 's do something that doesn 't make the lamb squeal and bleed we
 're on in five continents dude we 're on twice a day on the discovery we can 't do this he says 
 ok he goes to his box and pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands  melanie picks up another lamb puts it on the
  band goes on the tail band goes on the scrotum lamb goes on the ground lamb takes two steps falls down
 gets up shakes a little takes another couple steps falls down  i 'm like this is not a
 good sign for this lamb at all gets up  walks to the corner  it 's quivering and it lies down and it 's in obvious distress and
 i 'm looking at the lamb and i say
  them to fall off a week meanwhile the lamb that he had just done his little procedure on is you know
 he 's just prancing around  bleeding stopped he 's you know  nibbling on some grass  frolicking  
 and i was just so blown away at how completely wrong
 i was
  in that second  and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time 
 and i was especially reminded of what a ridiculously short straw i had that day because now i had to do what albert had just done and there are like one hundred of these lambs in the pen
  and suddenly this whole thing 's starting to feel like a german porno and i 'm like 
 melanie picks up the lamb puts it on the post opens it up albert hands me the
  knife i go in tail comes off  i go in i grab the scrotum tip comes off albert instructs push it way up there i do 
 push it further i do the testicles emerge they look like thumbs coming right at you
  how did i get here how did  i mean
 how did i get here  it 's just it 's one of those moments where the brain goes
 off on its own and suddenly i 'm standing there in the rockies  and all i can think of is the aristotelian definition of a tragedy  you know 
  aristotle says a tragedy is that is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity 
 and i 'm like what is this jacked up metaphor i don 't like what i 'm thinking right now and i can 't get this thought out of my head and i can 't get that vision
 out of my sight so i did what
 i had to do i went in and i took them i took them like this  and i yanked my head back and i 'm standing there
 with two testicles on my chin
 and now i can 't get i can 't shake the metaphor  i 'm still in
  in aristotle and i 'm thinking out of nowhere two terms come crashing into my head that i hadn 't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there and they are
  the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis  it 's what our network does it 's what dirty jobs is and i 'm up to my neck in 
  every single day great the other word peripeteia
 oedipus has his moment where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he 's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother   that 's
 peripety or peripeteia and this metaphor in my head i 've got anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin 
 laughter i 've got to tell you it 's such a
  spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people and then boom oh  i 'm dead peripeteia you know  it
 's crushing when the audience sees it the right way  neo in the matrix you know oh i 'm living in a computer program  that 's weird these
  been having them over two hundred dirty jobs i have them all the time but that one
 that one drilled something home in a way that i just wasn 't prepared for and as i stood there  looking at the happy lamb
 that
 i had just defiled but it looked ok  looking at that poor other little thing that i 'd done it
  if i 'm wrong about that and if i 'm wrong so often in a literal way what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon because look i
 'm not a social anthropologist but i have a friend who is and i i talk to him 
 laughter and he says hey mike look i don 't
  if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not but do you realize you 've shot in every state  you 've worked in mining you 've worked in fishing you 've worked in steel you 've worked 
  in every major industry  you 've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years right i can still see hillary doing the shots of rye  dribbling down her chin with the steel workers i mean 
  thoughts collectively  it might be time to think about it because dude you know  four years so  
 that 's in my head testicles are on my chin thoughts are bouncing around and 
 after that shoot dirty jobs really didn 't change in terms of what the show is
  but it changed for me personally  and now when i talk about the show i no longer just tell the story you heard and one hundred and ninety like it
  i do  but i also start to talk about some of the other things i got wrong 
 some of the other notions of work that i 've just been assuming are sacrosanct  
 and they 're not people with dirty jobs are happier
 than you think 
  the happiest people i know 
 and i don 't want to start whistling look for the union label and all that happy worker crap i 'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work roadkill  picker uppers whistle while they work i swear to god i did it with them 
 they 've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life  and i see it over and over and over again  so i started to wonder what would happen
 if we challenged some of these sacred cows follow your passion
 we 've been talking about
 for the last thirty six hours follow your passion what could possibly be wrong with that it 's probably the worst advice i ever got 
 laughter follow your dreams and go broke right  i mean
 that 's all i heard growing up i didn 't know what to do with my life but i was told if you follow your passion it 's going to work out i can give you thirty examples right now bob combs
  the pig farmer in las vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them to his swine why because there 's so much protein in the stuff we don 't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed 
 and he 's one rich pig farmer he 's good for the environment he spends his days doing this incredible service and he smells like hell but god bless him  he 's making a great living you ask him did you follow your passion here and he 'd laugh at you
 he didn 't follow his passion  he stepped back and he watched where everybody was going 
 and he went the other way 
  and i hear that story over and over matt freund 
 a dairy farmer in new canaan connecticut who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk if he could use it to make these biodegradable
  now he 's selling them to walmart right follow his passion  the guy 's
 come on  so i started to look at passion i started to look at
 efficiency  vs effectiveness as tim talked about earlier  that 's a huge distinction i
 started to look at teamwork and determination and basically all those platitudes they call successories that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now  
 that stuff
 it 's suddenly all been turned
 on its head 
 safety safety first is going back to osha and peta and the humane society
  what if osha got it wrong i mean this is heresy what i 'm about to say but what if
 what if it 's really safety third right 
 no i
  what i mean to say is  i value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that i 'm working with but
 the ones who really get it done they 're not out there talking about safety first 
 they know that other things come first the business of doing the work comes first the business of getting it done and
 i 'll never forget up in the bering sea i was on a crab boat with the deadliest catch
  which i also work on in the first season we were about one hundred miles off the coast of russia
 big waves green water coming over the wheelhouse right 
 most hazardous environment i 'd ever seen and i was back with a guy lashing the pots down  so i 'm forty feet off the deck  which is like looking down at the top of your shoe you know and it 's doing this in the ocean 
 unspeakably dangerous i scamper down i go into the wheelhouse and i say
  and he points out there 
 but in that moment what he said next can 't be repeated in the lower forty eight it can 't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site  but he looked at me and said son he 's my age by the way he calls me son i love that
  the captain of a crab boat my responsibility is not to get you home alive my responsibility is to get you home rich you
 want to get home alive that 's on you and for the rest of that day
 safety first i mean i was like
 so the idea that we create 
 this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else 's responsibility as though it 's our own and vice versa anyhow a whole lot of
  things i could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that i got it wrong  but what it all comes down to is this 
 i 've formed a theory  and i 'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and thirty seconds  it goes like this  
 we 've declared war
 on work as a society all of us  it 's a civil war  it 's a cold war really we didn
 we didn 't set out to do it and we didn 't twist our mustache in some machiavellian way but we 've done it and we 've waged this war
 on at least four fronts certainly in hollywood 
 the way we portray working people on tv it 's laughable 
 if there 's a plumber he 's three hundred pounds and he 's got a giant butt crack admit it you see him all the time that 's what plumbers look like right
  we turn them into heroes
 or we turn them into punch lines  that 's what tv does we try hard on dirty jobs not to do that which is why i do the work and i don 't cheat but 
 we 've waged this war on madison avenue
 so many of the commercials that come out there in the way of a message what 's really being said your life would be better if you could work a little less
 didn 't have to work so hard got home a little earlier could retire a little faster punch out a little sooner it 's all in there over and over again and again 
 washington i can 't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect
 the  bottom line reality of the available jobs because i don 't really know i just know that that 's a front in this war  and right here guys silicon valley  
 i mean
 how many people have an iphone on them right
  how many people have their blackberry  we 're plugged in we 're connected i would never suggest for a second
 that something bad has come out of the tech revolution good grief not to this crowd 
 laughter but i would suggest that innovation without imitation
 is a complete waste of time and nobody celebrates imitation the way dirty jobs guys
 know it has to be done your iphone without those people making the same interface
  circuitry the same board over and over all of that that 's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes
 inside of it so we 've got this new toolbox  you know  our tools today don 't look like shovels and picks 
 they look like the stuff we walk around with and so the collective
 effect of all of that has been
  this marginalization
 of lots and lots of jobs  
 and i realized probably too late in this game i hope not because i don 't know if i can do two hundred more of these things but we 're going to do as many as we can 
 and to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with is that fact that
 i got it wrong about a lot of things not just the
  i got a lot wrong so  we 're thinking by we i mean me 
 that the thing to do is to talk about a pr campaign for work
 manual labor  skilled labor  
 somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits  
 i 'm talking about grandfather stuff the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we 've
 kind of you know  kind of
  lost a little 
 barack wants to create two and a half million jobs  
 the infrastructure is a huge deal this war on work that i suppose exists has casualties like any other war  the infrastructure is the first one 
 declining trade school enrollments are the second one every single year fewer electricians  
 fewer carpenters fewer plumbers  fewer welders  fewer pipe fitters  fewer steam fitters
 the infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys
 the ones that have been in decline over and over  meanwhile we 've got two trillion dollars at a minimum  according to the american society of civil engineers that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure which is currently rated at a d minus 
  if i were running for anything and i 'm not i would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren
 't going to stick unless they 're jobs that people want  
 and i know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us  
 but i also know that clean and dirty aren 't opposites they 're two sides of the same coin just like innovation and imitation like risk and
  and anagnorisis 
 like that poor little lamb who i hope isn 't quivering anymore  and like my time that 's gone it 's been great talking to you and get back to work
