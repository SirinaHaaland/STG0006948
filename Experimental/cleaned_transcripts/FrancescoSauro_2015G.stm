  i would like to invite you to come along on a visit to a dark continent 
 it is the continent hidden under the surface of the earth it is largely unexplored poorly understood
  the stuff of legends  but it is made also of dramatic landscapes like this huge underground chamber  and it is rich with surprising
 biological
 thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers
 in the last three centuries actually  we know also thanks to satellite technology of course we know almost every single square meter of our planet 's
  we know still very little about what is hidden
 inside the earth because a cave landscape like this deep shaft in italy is hidden  
 the potential of cave exploration the geographical dimension is poorly understood and unappreciated 
 because we are creatures living on the surface our perception
 of the inner side of the planet
 is in some ways skewed as is that of the depth of the oceans or of
  the upper atmosphere
  systematic cave exploration started
 about one century ago  we know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world  
 a single cave system like mammoth cave which is in kentucky can be as long as more than six hundred kilometers  
 and an abyss like
 which is in the caucasus region  actually the deepest cave explored in the world  
 can go as far as more than two thousand meters below the surface  that means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer 
 caves form in karstic regions so karstic regions are areas of the
  twenty percent of the continents ' surface  and we know actually that 
 in the last fifty years have
  thirty thousand kilometers of cave passages around the world which is a big number  
 but geologists have estimated that what is still missing to be discovered and mapped 
 is something around ten million kilometers 
 that means that for each meter of a cave that we already know that we have explored there are still some
 tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages that means that this is really an endless
 and we will never be able to explore it completely  and this estimation is made without considering other types of caves like for example inside glaciers
 or even volcanic caves which are not karstic but are formed by lava flows  and if we have a look at other planets like for example
  you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet
 however i will show to you now that we do not need to go to mars to explore alien worlds  
 i 'm a speleologist that means a cave explorer  and
 i started with this passion when i was really young in the mountains not far from
  of the alps and the dolomites  
 but soon the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet searching for new potential entrances of this undiscovered continent 
 and in two thousand and nine i had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains which are in the orinoco and amazon basins
  enchanted me from the first time i saw them 
 they are surrounded by vertical vertiginous rock walls with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest 
 they really inspired in me a sense of wilderness with a soul older than millions and millions of years  
 and this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also conan doyle 's
  consider those mountains as islands in time 
 being separated from the surrounding lowlands since tens of millions of years ago they are surrounded by up to 
 walls resembling a fortress impregnable by humans and in fact  only a few of these mountains have been climbed and explored on their top
  mountains contain also a scientific paradox  they are made by quartz  which is a very common mineral on the earth 's crust 
 and the the rock made up by quartz is called  quartzite 
 and quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth  
 so we do not expect at all to find a cave
  have explored several caves in this area  
 so how can it be possible to understand this contradiction we have to consider the time factor  
 because the history of the  tepuis is extremely long starting about one point six billion
  years ago with the formation of the rock and then evolving
 with the uplift of the region
 one hundred and fifty million years ago  after the disruption of the pangaea supercontinent and the opening of the atlantic ocean  
 so you can imagine that the water had
 tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on
  cities  fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of  the tepuis 
 but nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame 
 and so i was focusing in two thousand and ten on one of those
  meters of vertical drop  and i was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems
 through satellite images  and finally we identified
 an area of collapses of the surface so big boulders rock piles
 and that means that there was a void below it was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain  so we
  did several attempts to reach this area 
 by land and with a helicopter but it was really difficult because you you have to imagine that these mountains are
 covered by clouds most of the year by fog there are strong winds and there are almost four thousand millimeters of rainfall per year so it 's really
  really difficult to find good conditions and only in two thousand and thirteen we finally
 landed on the on the spot and we started the exploration of the cave 
 the cave is huge it 's a huge network under the surface of the  tepui plateau  and
 in only ten days of expedition  we explored more than twenty kilometers of cave passages  and it 's
  the house of the gods you have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there it was impossible for them
 legends about the existence of a cave in the mountain  so when we started the exploration we had to explore with a great respect 
 both because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people but also because it was really a sacred place because
 no human had entered there before  
 so we had to use special protocols to not contaminate the environment with our presence  and we tried also to share with the community with the indigenous community
  discoveries and the caves represent really a snapshot of the past 
 the time needed for their formation could be as long as fifty or even 
  years which makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth 
 what you can find there is really
 of a lost world  when you enter a quartzite cave you have to completely forget what you know about caves
 classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world  because what seems a simple 
 here is not made by calcium carbonate but is made by
  and one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed 
 but you can find even stranger forms like these mushrooms of silica growing on a boulder and you can imagine our talks
 when we were exploring the cave we were the first entering
 and discovering those unknown things things like those monster eggs  and we were a bit scared because
 it was all a discovery
 we didn 't want to find a dinosaur  we didn 't find a dinosaur 
 anyway  actually we know that this kind of formation after several
 studies  we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms they are bacterial colonies
 using silica to build mineral structures
  stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth and here in the tepuis the interesting thing is that
 these bacteria colonies have evolved in complete isolation from
 the external surface  and without being in contact with humans
  they have never been in contact with humans  so the implications for science are enormous  because here you could find 
 for example microbes that could be
  useful
 to resolve diseases in medicine 
 or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties and in fact we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science which is 
 so whatever you find in the cave even a small
  has evolved in the dark in complete isolation 
 and really everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the mineralogical world  
 so
 as we explore this
 dark continent and discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and
  we will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet and on the relationship
 and evolution of life in relationship with the mineral world  what seems only a dark empty environment
 could be in reality a chest of wonders
 full of useful information with a team of italian venezuelan and brazilian
  to latin america  because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the amazon there are still very
 unknown mountains like marahuaca which is almost three thousand meters high above sea level or arac which is in the
 upper region of rio negro in brazil  and we suppose that
  to start so we don 't forget  francesco  you said we don 't need to go to mars to find alien life and indeed last time we spoke you were in sardinia
 and you were training european astronauts so what do you
 and teach to the astronauts francesco sauro yeah we are it 's a program of training for not not only european but also nasa  roskosmos jaxa astronauts in a cave so they stay in 
  a cave for about one week in isolation  they have to work together in a real real dangerous environment  
  and it 's very similar to a journey to mars or the international space station bg in principle fs yes 
 bg i want to go back to one of the pictures that was in your slide show and it 's just representative of the other photos weren 't those photos amazing yeah audience 
 yeah fs 
 i have to thank the photographers from the team la venta because all of those photos are
  from the photographers bg you bring actually photographers with you in the expedition  
 they 're professionals they 're speleologists and photographers 
 but when i look at these pictures  i wonder there is zero light down there and yet they look incredibly well exposed how do you take these pictures how do your colleagues the photographers take these pictures fs yeah 
 they are working
  so you can open the shutter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment bg so you 're basically fs yes you can even keep the shutter open for one minute and then paint the environment  the final result is what you want to achieve bg you
 spray the environment with light and that 's what you get  maybe we can try this at home someday
