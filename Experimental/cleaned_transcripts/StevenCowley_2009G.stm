  when are we going to get fusion it 's really
 been a long time since we 've known about fusion we 've known about fusion since one thousand nine hundred and twenty when sir arthur stanley eddington and the british association for the advancement of science
 conjectured that that 's why the sun shines
  always been very worried about resource i don 't know about you but when my mother gave me food i always sorted the ones i
 disliked from the ones i
 liked  and i ate the disliked ones first because the ones you like you want to save  and as a child you 're always
  and once it was sort of
 explained to me how fast we were using up the world 's resources 
 i got very upset about as upset as i did when i realized that the earth will only last about five billion years before it 's swallowed by the sun
 big events in my life a strange child 
 energy at the moment is dominated by
  probably the only person who really enjoys it when mister putin turns off the gas tap because my budget goes up
  we 're really dominated now
 by those things that we 're using up faster and faster and faster and as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty
 in the third world in the developing world we
 're using energy faster and faster and those resources are going away  and the way we 'll make energy in the future is not from resource  
 it 's really from knowledge 
 if you look fifty years into the
  future the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three 
 with some wind with some other things but these are going to be the base load energy drivers 
 solar can do it  and we certainly have to develop solar 
 but we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world 
 fission
 our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations 
 they 're going to put in six new nuclear power stations and probably more after that china is building nuclear power stations everybody is 
 because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon free energy 
 but if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is the perfect energy source is one that doesn 't take up much space
 has a virtually inexhaustible supply is safe doesn 't put any carbon into the atmosphere 
 doesn 't leave any long lived radioactive waste  
 it 's fusion  but there is a catch of course there is always a catch in these cases fusion is very hard to do  
 we 've been trying for fifty years
 okay what is fusion here comes the nuclear physics
 sorry about that but this is what turns me on 
 i was a strange child 
 nuclear energy comes for a simple reason the most stable nucleus is iron  right in the middle of the periodic table  it 's a medium sized nucleus  
  go towards iron
 if you want to get energy so uranium which is very big wants to split  
 but small atoms want to join together small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron  
 and you can get energy out this way and indeed that 's exactly what stars do in the middle of stars 
 you 're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon to make oxygen all the things that you 're made of are made in the middle of stars  
 but it 's a hard process to do
  do because as you know the middle of a star is quite hot  almost by definition  and there is one
 reaction
 that 's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do 
 it 's between two isotopes of of hydrogen two kinds of hydrogen  deuterium
  which is heavy hydrogen  which you can get from seawater and tritium which is super heavy hydrogen 
 these two nuclei when they 're far apart are charged  and you push them together and they repel  
 but when you get them close enough something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together 
 so most of the time they repel you get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together for a moment they become helium
  five because they 've got five particles inside them so that 's that process there deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium five 
 helium splits out and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out 
 if you can get something to about one hundred and fifty million degrees  things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration 
  and it will release energy  and that energy is what powers fusion  and it 's this reaction that we want to do there is one
 trickiness about this reaction well there is a trickiness that you have to make it one hundred and fifty million degrees but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet it 's pretty hot 
 the trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn 't exist in nature you have to
  make it from something else  and you make if from lithium that reaction at the bottom that 's lithium six  plus a neutron 
 will give you more helium  plus tritium  
 and that 's the way you make your tritium  but fortunately if you can do this fusion reaction you 've got a neutron  so you can make that happen 
 now why the hell would we bother to do this this is basically why we would bother to do it if you just plot
 how much fuel we 've got left
  in units of present world consumption  
 and as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil the the blue line by the way is the lowest estimate of existing resources and the yellow line is the most optimistic
 estimate  and as you go across there you will see that we 've got a few tens of years and perhaps one hundred years of
 fossil fuels left  
 and god knows we don 't really want to burn all of it because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air  and then we get to uranium  
 and with current reactor technology we really don 't have very much uranium  
 and we will have to extract uranium from sea water which is the yellow line to make
 conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us this is a bit shocking because in fact our government is relying on that for us to
 meet kyoto and do all those kind of things
  go any further you would have to have breeder technology and breeder technology
 is fast breeders and that 's pretty dangerous the big thing on the right is the lithium we have in the world  
 and lithium is in sea water that 's the yellow line  and we have thirty million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water  everybody can get it that 's why we want to do
  we make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant  and we get within
 about the same price as current electricity so how would we make it we have to hold something at one hundred and fifty million degrees  
 and in fact 
 we 've done this we hold it with a magnetic field and inside it right in the middle of this
  doughnut shape right in the middle is one hundred and fifty million degrees  it boils away in the middle at one hundred and fifty million degrees  and in fact we can make fusion happen  and just down the road 
 this is jet it 's the only machine in the world that 's actually done fusion when people say fusion is thirty years away and always will be i say yeah but we 've actually done it 
 right we can do fusion in the center of this device we made sixteen megawatts of fusion power in one thousand nine hundred and
  going to fire it up again and break all those records  
 but that 's not really fusion power that 's just making some fusion happen  we 've got to take that we 've got to make that into a fusion reactor because we want thirty million years worth of fusion power for the earth 
 this is the device we 're building now  it gets very expensive to do this research it turns out you can 't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense right
  you have to do it in a very big device more than half the world 's population is involved in building this device in southern france which is a nice place to put an experiment  seven
 nations are involved in building this it 's going to cost us ten billion and we 'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power  but that 's
 not
 electricity yet  we have to get to this 
 we have to get to a power plant  we have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology  and i 'd really like it to happen a lot
  faster than it is but at the moment all we can imagine is sometime in the
