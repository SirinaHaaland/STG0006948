  i 've noticed something interesting about society and culture everything risky requires a license  so
 learning to drive  owning a gun getting married  there 's a certain 
 that 's true in everything risky except technology
 for some reason there 's no standard syllabus there 's no basic course they just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest 
 you 're supposed to learn this stuff how just by osmosis nobody ever sits down and tells you this is how it works so today i 'm going to tell you ten things that you thought everybody knew but it
  on the web if you want to scroll down don 't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar that 's a terrible waste of time do that only if you 're paid by the hour instead hit the space bar the space bar 
 scrolls down one page  hold down the shift key to scroll back up again  so space bar to scroll down one page  works in every browser in every kind of computer  also 
  on the web when you 're filling in one of these forms like your addresses i assume you know that you can hit the tab key to jump from box to
  box to box  but what about the pop up menu where you put in your state 
 don 't open the pop up menu that 's a terrible waste of calories type the first letter of your state over and over and over so if you want connecticut go c c c if 
  you want texas go t t  and you jump right to that thing without even opening the  pop up menu 
  when the text is too small what you do is hold down the control key and hit plus plus plus  you make the text larger with each tap 
 works on every computer every web browser or minus minus to get smaller again if you 're on the mac it might be command instead
  when you 're typing on your blackberry android  iphone don 't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout to hit the period and then a space then try to capitalize the next letter just hit the space bar twice the phone puts the period
  space and the capital for you 
 go space space  it is totally amazing 
 also when it comes to cell phones on all phones  if you want to redial somebody that you 've dialed before all you have to do is hit the call button and it puts the last 
  phone number into the box for you and at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it no need to go to the recent calls list if you 're trying to
  somebody just hit the call button again something that drives me crazy when i call you and leave a message on your voice mail i hear you saying leave a message and then i get these fifteen seconds of freaking instructions like we haven 't had answering machines for 
 i 'm not bitter
  it turns out there 's a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this phone at the tone please david pogue 
 unfortunately the carriers didn 't adopt the same keystroke so it 's different by carrier so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke for the person you 're calling 
 i didn 't say these were going to be perfect  
 so most of you think of google as something that lets you look up a web page but it is also a dictionary type the word define and the word you want to know you
  't even have to click anything there 's the definition as you type it 's also a complete faa database type the name of the airline and the flight it shows you where the flight is the gate the terminal 
 how long until it lands you don 't need an app it 's also unit and currency conversion
  while we 're talking about text when you want to highlight this is just an example 
 laughter when you want to highlight a word  please don 't waste your life dragging across it with the mouse like a newbie double click the word watch two hundred 
 i go double click it neatly selects just that word also don 't delete what you 've highlighted you can just type over it this is in every program also you can go double click drag to highlight in
  increments as you drag much more precise again don 't bother deleting just type over it 
 shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera actually snaps  it 's extremely frustrating on any camera under
  time to calculate the focus and exposure  but if you 
 with a half press leave your finger down
 no shutter lag 
 you get it every time 
 i 've just turned your $ fifty camera into a $ one thousand camera with that trick  and finally it often happens that you 're giving a talk  and for some reason the audience is looking at the slide instead of at you
  so when that happens this works in keynote powerpoint it works in every program 
 b for blackout to black out the slide make everybody look at you and then when you 're ready to go on you hit b again  
 and if you 're really on a roll you can hit the w key for whiteout 
 and you white out the slide and then you can hit w again to un blank it so i know i went super fast if you missed anything i 'll be happy to send you the list of these tips
 in the meantime congratulations you all get your california technology license
