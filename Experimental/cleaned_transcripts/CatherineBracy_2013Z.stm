  'm going to talk about hackers and the image that comes to your mind when i say that word is probably not
 of benjamin franklin  but i 'm going to explain to you why it should be 
 the image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous
  mischievous or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity 
 or of an international rogue with a political agenda  
 and mainstream
 culture has
 kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of but like most
  in technology and the technology world hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil for every hacker that 's trying to steal your identity there 's one that 's building a tool
 that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor
 environmental quality after an oil spill hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system and it
  a deeply democratic activity it
 's about critical thinking it 's about questioning existing ways of doing things it 's the idea that if you see a problem you work to fix it and not just complain about it 
 and in many ways hacking is what built
 america  betsy ross was a hacker the underground railroad was a brilliant hack 
 and from the wright brothers to steve jobs hacking has always been at the foundation
 of american democracy
  so
 if there 's one thing i want to leave you here with today it 's that the next time you think about who a hacker is you think not of this guy
 but of this guy benjamin franklin who was one of the greatest hackers of all time  
 he was one of america 's most prolific inventors though he famously never filed a patent  because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available
  he brought us bifocals and the lightning rod and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of american democracy 
 and in code for america we really try to embody the spirit of ben franklin  he was a tinkerer and a statesman
 whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action he believed that government could be built by the people  and we call
  call those people
 civic hackers  
 so it 's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy  like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise are the same values
 that underly the internet  and so it 's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government but before i give you a few examples
  of what civic hacking looks like i want to make clear that you don 't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker you just have to believe that you can bring a 21st century tool set to bear on the problems 
  that government faces  and we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at code for america that they didn 't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects so keep that in mind 
  hackers 
 so what does civic hacking look like 
 our team last year in honolulu which in this case was three  full time fellows who were doing a year of public service were asked by the city to rebuild the website  
 and it 's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn 't going to be possible in
 the few months that they had so instead they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to
  how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website they 're looking for answers to questions 
 and they want to take action when they 're done  which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this  so our team built honolulu answers which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back
 plain language answers that drive a user towards action
  now the site itself was easy enough to build but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content 
 it would have taken the three of them a very long time especially given that none of them are actually from
 honolulu and so they did something that 's really radical when you think about how government is used to working  they
  wild pigs are a huge problem in honolulu  apparently 
 in one saturday afternoon they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions but more importantly than that they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government now i think
 this is a really cool story in and of itself
  but it gets more awesome on the national day of civic hacking
 this past june in oakland where i live the code for america team in oakland took the open source code base of honolulu answers and turned it into oakland answers 
 and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked
 questions and had citizens write the answers to them and i got into the act i authored
 this answer and a few others
  others  
 and i 'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that i feel for the place that i live based simply on this small act of participation 
 and by stitching together my small act
 with the thousands of other small
  acts of participation that we 're enabling through civic hacking we think we can reenergize citizenship
 and restore trust in government at
 this point you may be wondering what city officials think of all this they actually love it 
 as most of you guys know cities are being asked every day to do more with less and they 're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems  
 so
 when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting cities can actually capture
 the capacity in their communities
 to do the business of government  now i don 't want to leave the impression
 that civic hacking is just an american phenomenon it 's happening across the globe and one of my favorite examples is from mexico city where earlier this year the mexico house of representatives entered into a contract with a
 software development firm
 to build an app that legislators
  would use to track bills  so this was just for the handful of legislators
 in the house and the contract was a two year contract for nine point three million dollars 
 now a lot of people were really angry about this especially
 geeks who knew that nine point three million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app but instead of taking to
  streets  they issued a challenge  
 they asked programmers in mexico to build something better and cheaper
  and they offered a prize of nine thousand three hundred dollars
 ten thousand times cheaper than the government contract and they gave the entrants ten days  
 and in those ten days  they submitted
 one hundred and
  apps  five of which were presented to congress and are still in the app store today  and because of this action 
 that contract was vacated  and now this has sparked a movement in mexico city which is home to one of our partners code
 for mexico city  
 and so what you see in all three of these places in honolulu and in oakland and in mexico city are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking
  's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them and through that work they 're creating a 21st century ecosystem of participation they 're creating 
  a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved  besides voting or signing a petition or protesting  
  he founded
 the first volunteer firefighting company in philadelphia  called a brigade  
 and it 's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city so in true civic hacker fashion
  they built a solution  
 and we have our own brigades at code for america working on the projects that i 've just described  
 and we want to ask you to follow in ben franklin 's footsteps and come join us we have thirty one brigades in the u s we are pleased to announce today that we 're opening up 
  the brigade to international cities for the first time  starting with cities in poland and japan and ireland 
 and if there 's not a brigade where you live we will help you we 've created a tool kit which also lives at 
  we will support you along the way our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system
 in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems that will support local government  and that will empower citizens so please come hack with us
