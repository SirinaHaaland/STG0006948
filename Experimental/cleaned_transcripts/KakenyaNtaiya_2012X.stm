  in kenya people cross oceans
 to go see them these people are tall they jump high  they wear red  and they kill lions
  might be wondering who are these people these are the
 maasais and you know what 's cool  i 'm actually one of them 
 the maasais  the boys are brought up to be warriors the girls are brought up to be mothers when i was
 five years old  i found out that i was engaged
 to be married as soon as i reached puberty 
 my mother my grandmother 
 my aunties they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by 
 cool yeah and
 everything i had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman
 at age twelve my day started at five
  in the morning  milking the cows sweeping the house cooking for my siblings collecting water  firewood  
 i did everything that i needed to do
 to become a perfect wife i went to school not because the maasais  ' women or girls were going to
  's because my mother was denied an education 
 and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living 
 why did she say that my father worked as a policeman
 in the city he came home once a year  we didn 't see him for sometimes even two years 
 and whenever he came home  it was a different case my mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat
  she reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us  
 but when my father came he would sell the cows he would sell the the products we had and he went and drank with his friends in
 in the bars  because my mother was a woman she was not allowed to own any property  and by default everything in my family
  belongs to my father so he had the right  and if my mother ever questioned him he beat her abused her and really
 it was difficult 
 when i went to school  i had a dream  i wanted to become a teacher  
 teachers looked nice  they wear nice dresses high heeled shoes i found out later that they are uncomfortable but i admired it
  most of all the teacher was just writing on the board
 not hard work that 's what i thought
  compared to what i was doing in the farm  so i wanted to become a teacher  i worked hard in school  but when i was in eighth grade  
 it was a determining factor in our tradition there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become
  and it 's a rite of passage to womanhood  
 and then i was just finishing my eighth grade  and that was a transition for me to go to high school  this was the crossroad 
 once i go through this tradition  i was going to become a wife 
 well  my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass  so i talked
 i had to come up with a plan to figure these things out i talked to my father i did something that most girls have never done
  i told my father i will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school 
 the reason why if i ran away  my father will have a stigma 
 people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn 't go through the ceremony it was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life  so he figured out
  i did the ceremony happened  it 's a whole week long of excitement
  it 's a ceremony people are enjoying it 
 and the day before the actual ceremony happens we were dancing having excitement  and through all the night we we did not sleep  
 the actual day came  
 and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in yes we danced and danced we walked out to the courtyard
 and there were a bunch of people waiting  they were all in a circle  
 and as we danced and danced and we approached this circle of women men women children everybody was there 
 there was a woman sitting in the middle of it  
 and this woman was waiting to hold us 
  were my sisters and a couple of other girls  and as i approached her  
 she looked at me and i sat down  
 and i sat down  and i opened my legs  
 as i opened my leg  another woman came  and this woman was carrying a knife  
 and as she carried the knife  she walked toward me and she held the clitoris  and
  it off 
 as you can imagine  i bled  i bled after bleeding for a while i fainted thereafter  
 it 's something that so many girls i 'm lucky i never died but many die  
 it 's practiced  it 's no anesthesia it 's a rusty old knife  
 and it was difficult  i was lucky because one also
  mom did something that most women don 't do 
 three days later after everybody has left the home my mom went and brought a nurse we were taken care of three weeks later  i was healed and i was back in high school  
 i was so determined
 to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference
  while i was in high school  something happened  
 i met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the university of oregon this man was wearing a white t shirt jeans
  camera
  white sneakers and i 'm talking about white sneakers there is something about clothes i think and shoes
 they were sneakers
  that doesn 't even have paved roads it was quite attractive  
 i told him 
 well i want to go to where you are because this man looked very happy  
 and i admired that  
 and he told me well what do you
 mean you want to go don 't you have a husband waiting for you and i told him don 't worry about that part just tell me how to get there
  while i was in high school also my dad was sick he got a stroke  and he was really really sick so he really couldn 't tell me what to do next  
 but the problem is my father is not the only father i have 
 everybody who is my dad 's age male in the community is my father by default my uncles all of them and they dictate what my future is 
 so the news came  i applied
  to school and i was accepted to randolph macon woman 's college in lynchburg virginia  and i couldn 't come
 without the support of the village because i needed to raise money to buy the air ticket i got a scholarship but i needed to get myself here  
 but i needed the support of the village  
 and here again when the men heard and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school
  they said what a lost opportunity this should have been given to a boy  we can 't do this 
 so i went back and i had to go back to the tradition  
 there 's a belief among our people that
 morning brings good news so i had to come up with something to do with the morning  because there 's good news in
  if he says yes everybody will follow him  so i went to him very early in the morning as the sun rose the first thing he sees when he
 opens his door is  it 's me 
 my child what are you doing here well dad i need help can you support me to go to america 
 i promised him that i would be the best girl  i will come back 
 anything they wanted after that i will do it for
 he said well but i can 't do it alone he gave me a list of another
 fifteen men that i went sixteen more men every single morning i went and visited them they all came together 
 the village the women the men everybody came together to support me
 to come to get an education  i arrived in america as you can imagine what did i find  i found snow
 i found wal marts vacuum cleaners  
 and lots of food in the cafeteria i was in a land of plenty  
 i enjoyed myself 
 but during that moment while i was here  i discovered a lot of things  i learned that
 that ceremony that i went through when i was thirteen years old  it was called
  female genital mutilation  i learned that it was against the law in kenya  i learned that
 i did not have to trade part of my body
 to get an education  i had a right  and as we speak right now  three million girls in africa are at risk of going through
  i learned that my mom had a right to own property  i learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman 
 those things made me angry  
 i wanted to do something  
 as i went back every time i went  i found that my neighbors ' girls were getting married  they were getting mutilated  
 and here  after i graduated from here i worked at the u n i went back to school to get my graduate work
  the constant cry of these girls was in my face i had to do something 
 as i went back  i started talking to the men to the village and mothers and i said i want to give back the way i had promised you that i would come back and help you 
 what do you need as i spoke to the women they told me you know what we need we really need a school for
  because there had not been any school for girls and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she 's walking to school  the mother is blamed for that 
 if she got pregnant
 before she got married  the mother is blamed for that and she 's punished she 's beaten they said we wanted to put our girls in a safe place 
 as we moved  and i went to talk to the fathers the fathers of course you can imagine what they said we want a school for boys and i said
  well  there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education  
 why can 't they build a school for boys and i 'll build a school for girls that made sense  and they agreed  
 and i told them  i wanted them to show me a sign of commitment and they did  they donated land
  to meet one of the girls in that school  
 angeline came to apply for the school 
 and she did not meet any criteria that we had 
 she 's an orphan yes  we could have taken her for that but she was older  she was twelve years old and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade  
 angeline had been moving from one place because she 's an orphan she has no mother she has no father moving from one grandmother 's house to another one from aunties to aunties she had no
  stability in her life  and i looked at her i remember that day and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline 
 and yes she was older to be in fourth grade  we gave her the opportunity to come to the class 
 five months later that is angeline a transformation had begun in her life angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world
  she was not the top student when we took her  now she 's the best student not just in our school  but in the entire division that we are in 
 that 's sharon that 's five years later 
 that 's evelyn five months later that is the difference that we are making 
 as a new
 dawn is happening in my school a new beginning is happening as we speak right now one hundred and twenty five girls will never be mutilated 
 one hundred twenty five girls
 will not be married when they 're twelve years old one hundred twenty five girls are creating and achieving their dreams 
 this is the thing that we are doing giving them opportunities where they can
  as we speak right now women are not being beaten
 because of the revolutions we 've started in our community i want to challenge
 you today  
 you are listening to me because you are here very optimistic  you are
  you are somebody who wants to see a better world  
 you are somebody who wants to see that war ends no poverty  you are somebody who wants to make a difference  you are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better  
 i want to challenge you today
 that to be the first  because people will follow you 
 be the first people will follow you be bold stand up be fearless
  be confident  move out because as you change your world as
 you change your community  as we believe that we are impacting one girl one family  one village  one country at a time 
 we are making a difference so if you change your world  you are going to change your community  you are going to change your country and think about that if you do that and i do that
  aren 't we going to create a better future for our children for your children for our grandchildren  and we will live in a very peaceful world  thank you very much
