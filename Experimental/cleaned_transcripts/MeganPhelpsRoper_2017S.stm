  when i joined my family on the picket line for the first time my mom made me leave my dolls in the minivan i 'd stand on a street corner in the heavy kansas
  surrounded by a few dozen relatives with my tiny fists clutching a sign that i couldn 't read yet 
 gays are worthy of death 
 this was the beginning 
 our protests soon became a daily occurrence and an international phenomenon 
 and as a member of westboro baptist church  i became a fixture on picket lines across the country  
 the end of my antigay picketing career and life as i
  came twenty years later  triggered in part by strangers on twitter
 who showed me the power of engaging the other 
 in my home life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil 
 the good was my church and its members and the evil was everyone else 
 my church 's antics were such that we were constantly at odds with the world and that reinforced our otherness on a daily basis 
 make a difference between the unclean and the clean
 the verse says  and so we did from baseball games to military funerals we trekked across the country with neon protest signs in hand
 to tell others exactly how unclean they were
 and exactly why they were headed for damnation this was the focus of our whole lives  this was the only way for me to do
  a world that sits in satan 's lap 
 and like the rest of my ten siblings i believed what i was taught with all my heart  and i pursued westboro 's agenda with a special sort of zeal 
 in two thousand and nine that zeal brought me to twitter 
 initially the people i encountered on the platform were just as hostile as i expected 
 they were the digital version of the screaming hordes i 'd been seeing at protests since i was a kid 
 but
 in the midst of that digital brawl a strange pattern developed
  someone would arrive at my profile with the usual rage and scorn  
 i would respond with a custom mix of bible verses  pop culture references and smiley faces 
 they would be understandably confused and caught off guard  but then a conversation would ensue  and it was civil full of genuine
 curiosity on both sides how had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world 
 sometimes the conversation even bled into real life 
 people i 'd sparred with on twitter would come out to the picket line to see me when i protested in their city 
 a man named david was one such person he ran a blog called jewlicious and after several months of heated but friendly arguments
  he came out to see me at a picket in new orleans  
 he brought me a middle eastern dessert from jerusalem where he lives  and i brought him kosher chocolate and held a god hates jews sign 
 there was no confusion about our positions but the line between friend and foe was becoming blurred we
 'd started to see each other as human beings  and it changed the way we spoke to one another 
 it took time but eventually these conversations planted seeds of doubt in me
  my friends on twitter took the time to understand westboro 's doctrines  and in doing so they were able to find inconsistencies i 'd missed my entire life 
 why did we advocate the death penalty for gays when jesus said let he who is without sin cast the first stone 
 how could we claim to love our neighbor while at the same time praying for god to destroy them 
 the truth is that the care shown to me
  by these strangers on the internet was itself a contradiction it was growing evidence that people on the other side were not the demons i 'd been led to believe 
 these realizations were life altering 
 once i saw that we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth but flawed human beings  i couldn 't pretend otherwise  
 i couldn 't justify our actions
 especially our cruel practice of
  protesting funerals and celebrating human tragedy 
 these shifts in my perspective contributed to a larger erosion of trust in my church and eventually it made it impossible for me to stay 
 in spite of overwhelming grief and terror i left westboro in two thousand and twelve 
 in those days just after i left the instinct to hide was almost paralyzing
  i wanted to hide from the judgement of my family who i knew would never speak to me again
 people whose thoughts and opinions had meant everything to me and i wanted to hide from the world i 'd rejected for so long
 people who had no reason at all to give me a second chance after a lifetime of antagonism 
 and yet  unbelievably they did the world had access to my past because it was all over the internet thousands of tweets
  and hundreds of interviews  everything from local tv news to the howard stern show but so many embraced me with open arms anyway  
 i wrote an apology for the harm i 'd caused but i also knew that an apology could never undo any of it 
 all i could do was try to build a new life and find a way somehow to repair some of the
  people had every reason to doubt my sincerity  but most of them didn 't and
 given my history it was more than i could 've hoped for
 forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt it still amazes me i spent my first year away from home
 adrift with my younger sister who had chosen to leave with me  we walked into an abyss
  we were shocked to find the light and a way forward in the same communities we 'd targeted for so long 
 david my jewlicious friend from twitter  
 invited us to spend time among a jewish community in los angeles  we slept on couches in the home of a hasidic rabbi and his wife and their four kids
 the same rabbi that i 'd protested three years earlier with a sign that said your rabbi is a whore 
  we spent long hours talking about theology and judaism and life while we washed dishes in their kosher kitchen and chopped vegetables for dinner 
 they treated us like family  they held nothing against us and again i was astonished 
 that period was full of turmoil but
 one part i 've returned to often is a surprising realization i had during that time
 that it was a relief and a privilege to let go of the harsh judgments that
  instinctively ran through my mind about nearly every person i saw  i realized that now i needed to learn i needed to listen 
 this has been at the front of my mind lately because
 i can 't help but see in our public discourse so many of the same destructive impulses that ruled my former church  
 we celebrate tolerance and diversity more than at any other time in memory  and still
  we grow more and more divided we want good things justice equality freedom dignity prosperity
 but the path we 've chosen looks so much like the one i walked away from four years ago  we 've
 broken the world into us and them only emerging from our bunkers long enough to lob rhetorical grenades at the other camp we write off half the country as
 or racist misogynist bullies  no nuance  no complexity no humanity 
 even when someone does call for empathy and understanding for the other side the conversation nearly always devolves into a debate about who deserves more empathy 
 and just as i learned to do  we routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions or the merits in our opponent
  is anathema  we even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line 
 this path has brought us cruel sniping  deepening polarization and even outbreaks of violence  
 i remember this path it will not take us where we want to go  
 what gives me hope is that we can do something about this the good news is that it 's simple
  the bad news is that it 's hard  we have to talk
 and listen to people we disagree with 
 it 's hard because we often can 't fathom how the other side came to their positions  
 it 's hard because righteous indignation that sense of certainty that ours is the right side is so seductive  
 it 's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion
 to people who show us hostility
  and contempt  
 the impulse to respond in kind is so tempting 
 but that isn 't who we want to be we can resist  and i will always be inspired to do so by those people i encountered on twitter 
 apparent enemies who became my beloved friends 
 and in the case of one particularly understanding and generous
  there was nothing special about the way i responded to him  
 what was special was their approach  
 i thought about it a lot over the past few years and i found four things they did differently that made real conversation possible 
 these four steps were small but powerful  and i do everything i can to employ them in difficult conversations today the first is
 don 't assume bad intent
  my friends on twitter realized that even when my words were aggressive and offensive i sincerely believed i was doing the right thing  
 assuming ill motives almost instantly cuts us off from truly understanding why someone does and believes as they do 
 we forget that they 're a human being with a lifetime of experience that shaped their mind 
 and we get stuck on that first wave of anger and the conversation has a very hard time ever
  moving beyond it but when we assume good or neutral intent  we give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue  
 the second
 is ask questions when we engage people across ideological divides asking questions helps us map the disconnect between our differing points of view 
 that 's important because we can 't present effective arguments if we don 't understand where the other
  side is actually coming from
 and because it gives them an opportunity to point out flaws in our positions  
 but asking questions serves another purpose  it signals to someone that they 're being heard 
 when my friends on twitter stopped accusing and started asking questions i almost automatically mirrored them 
 their questions gave me room to speak but they also gave me permission to ask them questions
  and to truly hear their responses  it fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation 
 the third is stay calm 
 this takes practice and patience but it 's powerful 
 at westboro i learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others  i thought my rightness justified my rudeness
 harsh tones raised voices insults interruptions
  that strategy is ultimately counterproductive  
 dialing up the volume and the snark is natural in stressful situations but it tends to bring the conversation to an unsatisfactory  explosive end 
 when my husband was still just an anonymous twitter acquaintance our discussions frequently became hard and pointed but we always refused to
  he would change the subject he would tell a joke or recommend a book or gently excuse himself from the conversation 
 we knew the discussion wasn 't over just paused for a time to bring us back to an even keel 
 people often lament that digital communication makes us less civil but this is one advantage that online conversations have over in person ones  
 we have a buffer of time and space between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating
  we can use that buffer  instead of lashing out we can pause  
 breathe change the subject or walk away  and then come back to it when we 're ready  
 and finally  make the argument 
 this might seem obvious but one side effect of having strong beliefs is that we sometimes assume that the value of our position
 is or should be obvious and self evident that we shouldn 't have to defend our positions because they 're so clearly right and good
 that if someone doesn 't get it it 's their problem that it 's not my job to educate them 
 but if it were that simple  we would all see things the same way as kind as my friends on
 twitter were if they hadn 't actually made their arguments it would 've been so much harder for me to see the world in a different way 
 we are all a product of our upbringing and our beliefs reflect our experiences  
 we can 't expect others to spontaneously change their own minds if we want change we have to make the case for it 
 my friends on twitter didn 't abandon their beliefs or their principles
 only their scorn  they channeled their infinitely
  justifiable offense and came to me with pointed questions tempered with kindness and humor 
 they approached me as a human being and that was more transformative than two full decades of outrage  disdain and violence  
 i know that some might not have the time or the energy or the patience for extensive
  as difficult as it can be reaching out to someone we disagree with
 is an option that is available to all of us and i sincerely believe that we can do hard things 
 not just for them but for us and our future  
 escalating disgust and intractable conflict are not what we want for ourselves or our country or our next generation 
 my mom
  a sign that i couldn 't read
  but to me  she was missing the bigger picture
 that we 're all just human beings 
 that we should be guided by that most basic fact and approach one another with generosity and compassion 
 each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up 
 the end of this spiral of
  rage and blame begins with one person who refuses to indulge these destructive seductive impulses  
 we just have to decide that it 's going to start with us thank you
