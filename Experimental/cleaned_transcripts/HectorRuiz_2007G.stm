  like to say upfront is that i 'm really here by accident  and what i mean not at ted that
 i 'm at this point in my life truly my set of circumstances i would truly consider an accident  but what i 'd like to talk to you
  about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology
 to make those accidents happen often  
 because i really think when i look back at how i actually ended up
 in this accident technology played a big role in that so what i 'd like
  today is tell you a little bit about myself because i 'd like to put in context what i 'm going to tell you  and i think you will see why
 the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education  and
 once i put that in context i 'd like to tell you a little bit about technology why i believe technology is a tremendous enabler a very powerful tool to help
  address some of these challenges then about the initiative that chris mentioned that we decided to launch at amd that we call 
 and then i 'll come back to the beginning and tell you a little bit more hopefully
 convince you that i believe that in today 's world  it is really important for business leaders
 not only to have an idea of what their business is all about but to have a passion
 for something that is meaningful so with that in mind first of all let me tell you
 'm one of five children i 'm the oldest the other four are women  so i grew up in a family of women  i learned a lot about how to deal with
 that part of the world 
 laughter and as you can imagine if you can picture this i was born in a very small village in mexico 
 in unfortunately very poor surroundings
  and my parents did not have a college education  but i was fortunate to be able to have one  and so were my four sisters that kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of
 the emphasis that my parents placed on education my parents were fanatics about learning and i 'll come back to that a little bit later  but one of the things
 that exposed me early
  and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child was through a technology which is on the screen is a victrola  
 my father found that in a junkyard  and was able to repair it and make it work 
 and somehow to this day i frankly don 't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world
 but by inviting me to sit down with him when i was
  only a few years old and playing records in this victrola by
 mozart and he would tell me how mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever  
 and how claire de lune  which was one of his favorites was a real exposure to me to classical music
 he explained to me about johann strauss  
 and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world  and would tell me a little bit about history too when he 'd play the
 on this little victrola  and he would tell me about russia and all the things that were happening in russia at those times
 and why this music  in some way  represented a little bit of that history  
 and even as a child he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity and perhaps to you this
 product may not look like
 high tech but if you can imagine the time when this occurred it was in the mid
  really in his view a pretty piece of high tech  well  one of the things that
 that is really critical to try to distill from that experience
 is that in addition to that people ask me and say well how did your parents treat you when you were a child and i always said that they were really tough on me 
 and not tough in the sense that most people
  think of where
 your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever
 they were tough in the sense that as i grew up both my mother and father would always say to me
 it 's really important that you always remember two things  first of all when you go to bed at night 
 you 've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt
 the day was a day which you contributed something and that you did everything you could
 to do it the best way you could and the second thing they said  and we trust you that no matter where you are or where you go you will always do the right thing now
 i don 't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids but if you do 
 please trust me it 's the most pressure you can put on a child to say
  it can only be helpful
 if it is useful of course  but it can only be helpful too if it 's accessible and it can only be helpful if it 's affordable and in today 's world 
  being useful affordable and accessible
 is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today so one of our passions in our company  and now one of my personal passions 
 is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful  
 accessible and affordable and to me that is very very critical now technology has changed a lot since the victrola days you know we now have
  incredibly powerful computers 
 a tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the internet although frankly speaking we don 't believe the internet is the killer app what we believe is that the internet frankly is a connection of people and ideas 
 the internet happens to be just the medium
 in which those people and ideas get connected  and the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome  
 and so we believe that through all the changes that have occurred that we 're faced today with a tremendous
  opportunity if we can connect people and ideas more
 more intensely
 and although
 you 've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today  the key to me is how many of these products
 are able to provide people connectivity
  regardless of the economic status that a person could have that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology 
 so when you look at that we said well we would like to then enable that a little bit we would like to create an initiative  and a couple of years ago at amd 
 we came up with this idea of saying  what if we create this initiative we call
  where we are going to aim  that by the year two thousand and fifteen half of the world will be connected to the internet
 so that people and ideas can get connected  we knew we couldn 't do it by ourselves and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at amd could do it alone  we always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with
  educational institutions a myriad of other companies and frankly even competitors so it is really a
 rather lofty initiative if you want to think that way  
 but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead that was bold enough and and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently  
 and i 'll come back to that in a minute because i think
 the results so far have been remarkable  and i can only anticipate
  and get real excited about what i think is going to happen in the next eight years  while we get to the two thousand and fifteen initiative where are we today 
 that 's year by year this comes from our
 friends at 
 those of you who 've never looked at their website you should look at it it 's really impressive and you can see how
  the internet penetration has changed over the years  and so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well where are we related to our goal
 towards two thousand and fifteen the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces one
 is the western world  defined mostly by western europe and the united states 
 has made an awful lot of progress the connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase
  we think reaching one hundred percent is very doable  even before the two thousand and fifteen timeframe  
 in other parts of emerging countries such as india and china  the progress has been good has been solid has been good 
 but in places that are not as developed places like africa  latin america
 and other places in the world  the progress has been rather slow
  as a matter of fact  i was just recently visiting south africa i had the opportunity to
 have a discussion with president mbeki  and one of the things that we talked about is what is it that 's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster  
 and one of the reasons is in south africa it costs one hundred dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity  
 it is impossible  even in the united states for that cost to be able to enable the connectivity that we 're all trying to reach so we talked about ways
  in which perhaps
 one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down 
 so when you look at this chart you look at the very last it 's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale you look at the very end 
 we 've got quite a long way to go to get to the two thousand and fifteen goal of fifty percent but we 're excited in our company we 're motivated we really think it 's a
 phenomenal driver of things 
 to force us to do things differently  and we look forward to being able to actually working with so many partners around the world  to be able to
 reach that goal now one of the things i 'd like to 
 which i think is really critical is that it is not a charity  
 it is actually a business venture  let 's take a small segment of this of this
 unconnected world  and call it the education
  market  when you look at elementary school children we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world
 that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the internet 
 therefore when we see that we see an opportunity to to have a business that addresses the need of that segment and when we embarked in
  from the very beginning we said it very clearly 
 this is not a charity this is really a business venture one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market  because what we have learned in the last three years
 is that this segment of the market whether it 's education or 
  nations either way it 's a segment that demands incredibly high quality incredibly high reliability tremendous low cost and
  and a lot of
 challenges
 that frankly  without actually doing it it would be very difficult to understand and i 'll explain that in just a minute  
 it is an initiative that is focused on simple accessible and  human centric solutions what we mean by that is you know frankly the pc was invented in
  and it looks the same  and frankly
 and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this but i truly mean it
 if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it it would be very difficult to judge who made it because they 're all highly commoditized
 but they 're all different so there has not been a  human centric approach to addressing this segment of the market so we really believe it is critical to think of it it reminded
  me a lot of the talk we heard this morning about this
 operating room machinery that was designed specifically for africa we 're talking about something very similar here  
 and it has to be based on a geo sensitive approach what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world  the government plays a key role in the development of technology  in other parts it doesn 't  
 in other parts of the world you have
 an infrastructure that allows for
  to take place  in other parts it doesn 't and then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed
 and put into action in those regions and the last piece which is really important
 and this is an opinion that we have not shared by many this is one where we seem to stand alone on this one
 is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local
  integrated  end to end ecosystems 
 what i mean by that and let me use this example the country of south africa  because i was just there therefore i 'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges
 they have it 's a country of forty five million people it
 's an economy that 's emerging it 's beginning to grow tremendously 
 they have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity they have a computer company that makes computers in south africa they 're developing a
  environment in their universities what a place what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools  
 and to my surprise i learned in south africa they have eighteen dialects i always thought they only had two
 english and afrikaans but it turns out they have eighteen dialects and to be able to
 to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system it could
  only be done from from inside  i don 't think this segment of the market
 can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world  and just dumping product and selling into the markets so we believe
 that in those regions of the world where the population is large and there 's an infrastructure that can provide it that a local integrated
  is really critical for its success this is a picture of a classroom that we
 outfitted with computers
 in mexico in my home country this particular classroom happens to be in the state of michoacan those of you that might be familiar with mexico michoacan is a very colorful state 
 children dress with very colorful  colorful clothes  
 and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of of kids  in a computer and
 i have to tell you that it 's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives
 and education of these kids  we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the
 west cape in south africa  in a school that
  and activities of these children being able to access computers it 's just phenomenal 
 and recently they 've written us letters  telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives
 on their educational dreams on their capabilities 
 and it 's just phenomenal we have now
 deployed thirty different technologists in eighteen different countries and we have been able to connect millions of people
  effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands  
 and i have to tell you that although millions doesn 't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected it
 's a start  and we are learning a lot and we 're learning a tremendous amount
 about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective 
 one example of this has been the one laptop per child some of you are familiar with this this is a partnership between mit and a
  of companies google is involved red hat and amd is a key player
 the electronics behind the one laptop per child are based on 
  a microprocessor  
 but to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be one of the objectives of the one laptop per child is to be able to achieve a 10 hour battery life because it was felt that a
  a school day
 would last at least eight hours and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it 
 the engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part and battery life on this product is now fifteen hours
 just through a lot of innovative work people have done
 because they 're passionate and motivated to be able to do this we expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year  and we 're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education
  highly focused product
 aimed at strictly the education market not only in the developing countries  
 but actually in the developed regions as well  because there are parts of the united states where this can have also a huge impact
 on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient  we also have partnered with ted in this
  with architecture for humanity  and along with the ted prize winner cameron sinclair we 're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with
 the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region and we 're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this 
 and can 't wait to see what comes out of this exciting exciting activity  
 let me come back to the to the beginning
  tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry in business is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems  
 i don 't think it 's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet and look at numbers
 and say yes that 's a good business i really believe that you have to have a passion for it
