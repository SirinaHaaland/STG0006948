  being trapped inside your body  a body that doesn 't respond to
  surrounded by people yet utterly alone  wishing you could reach out to connect 
 to comfort to participate for thirteen long years that was my reality 
 most of us never think twice about talking about communicating  
 i 've thought a lot about it 
 i 've had a lot of time to think for the first twelve years of my life i was a normal happy healthy little boy
  everything changed 
 i contracted a brain infection  the doctors weren 't sure what it was  but they treated me the best they could however  i progressively got worse  
 eventually  i lost my ability to control my movements  make eye contact  and finally my
  while in hospital i desperately wanted to go home  i said to my mother when home 
 those were the last words i ever spoke with my own voice  
 i would eventually fail every test for mental awareness my parents were told i was as good as not there a vegetable  having the intelligence of a three month old baby 
 they were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable until i died
 my parents in fact my entire family 's lives became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how 
 their friends drifted away 
 one year turned to two two turned to three  
 it seemed like the person i once was began to disappear  the lego blocks and electronic circuits i 'd loved as a boy were put away i
  been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one i had become a ghost  a faded memory of a boy people once knew and loved  
 meanwhile  my mind began knitting itself back together  
 gradually my awareness started to return  but no one realized that i had come back to
  i was aware of everything  just like any normal person i could see and understand everything  but i couldn 't find a way to let anybody know 
 my personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body  a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis  
 the stark reality hit me that i was going to spend the rest of my life locked inside myself  totally
  i was trapped with only my thoughts for company  i would never be rescued 
 no one would ever show me tenderness  i would never talk to a friend  no one would ever love me  
 i had no dreams  no hope  nothing to look forward to well  nothing pleasant  
 i lived in fear and to put it bluntly was waiting
 for death to finally release me  expecting to die all alone in a care home  
 i don 't know if it 's truly possible to express in words what it 's like not to be able to communicate 
 your personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog and all of your emotions and desires are constricted  stifled and muted within you 
 for me the worst was the feeling of utter
  i simply existed it 's a very dark place to find yourself because in a sense you have vanished  
 other people controlled every aspect of my life they decided what i ate and when  whether i was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair  
 i often spent my days positioned in front of the tv watching barney reruns  
 i think because barney is so happy and jolly and i absolutely wasn
 it made it so much worse
  i was completely powerless to change anything in my life or people 's perceptions of me  i was a silent  invisible observer of how people behaved 
  when they thought no one was watching  unfortunately i wasn 't only an observer 
  devoid of feelings that people used to play out their darkest desires 
 for more than ten years people who were charged with my care abused me physically  verbally and sexually  
 despite what they thought i did feel  
 the first time it happened  i was shocked and filled with disbelief
  how could they do this to me  
 i was confused what had i done to deserve this 
 part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight  
 hurt  sadness and anger flooded through me  i felt worthless there was no one to comfort me  
 but neither of my parents knew this was happening  
 i lived in terror  knowing it would happen again and again  i just never knew when all i
  knew was that i would never be the same  
 i remember once listening to whitney houston singing no matter what they take from me  they can 't take away my dignity 
 and i thought to myself you want to bet 
 perhaps my parents could have found out and could have
  but the years of constant caretaking  having to wake up every two hours to turn me  combined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son had taken a toll on my mother and father  
 following yet another heated argument between my parents in a moment of despair and desperation my mother turned to me and told me that i should die  
 i was shocked  but as i thought about what she had said  i was filled with enormous compassion and love
 for my mother  yet i could do nothing about it 
 there were many moments when i gave up sinking into a dark abyss  i remember one particularly low moment 
 my dad left me alone in the car while he quickly went to buy something from the store  a random stranger walked
  looked at me
 and he smiled  
 i may never know why  but that simple act the fleeting moment of human connection transformed how i was feeling making me want to keep going 
 my existence was tortured by monotony  a reality that was often too much to bear alone with my thoughts i constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor 
  myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were as i learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed  i understood how long it would be before i was picked up and taken home
 seeing my father walk through the door to collect me was the best moment of the day 
 my mind became a tool that i could use to either close down to retreat from my reality or
  enlarge into a gigantic space that i could fill with fantasies 
 i hoped that my reality would change and someone would see that i had come back to life  but i had been washed away like a sand castle built too close to the waves  
 and in my place was the person people expected me to be 
 to some i was martin a vacant shell  the vegetable deserving of harsh words dismissal
  and even abuse 
 to others i was the tragically brain damaged boy who had grown to become a man someone they were kind to and cared for 
 good or bad  i was a blank canvas onto which different versions of myself were projected  
 it took someone new to see me in a different way
  began coming to the care home about once a week  whether through intuition or her attention to details that others failed to notice she became convinced that i could understand what was being said 
 she urged my parents to have me tested by experts in augmentative and alternative communication  
 and within a year  i was beginning to use a computer program to communicate 
 it was exhilarating but frustrating at times
  had so many words in my mind that i couldn 't wait to be able to share them  sometimes i would say things to myself simply because i could 
 in myself  i had a ready audience  and i believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes others would listen too but as i began to communicate more 
 i realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of creating a new voice for myself
 i was thrust into a world i didn 't quite know how to function in 
 i stopped going to the care home and managed to get my first job making photocopies 
 as simple as this may sound  it was amazing  my new world was really exciting but often quite overwhelming and frightening  i was like a
  and as liberating as it often was i struggled  
 i also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time found it impossible to abandon the idea of martin they had in their heads  while those i had only just met struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair  
 i realized that some people would only listen to me if what i said was in line with what they expected  
  it was disregarded and they did what they felt was best 
 i discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message  
 it is about getting the message heard and respected 
 still things were going well  my body was slowly getting stronger  i had a job in computing that i loved  and had even got kojak  the dog i had been dreaming about for years  
 however  i longed to share my life with
  someone  
 i remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work  thinking i have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to 
 just as i had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life  i met joan  
 not only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me
  helped me to challenge my own misconceptions about myself joan said it was through my words that she fell in love with me  
 however  after all i had been through
 i still couldn 't shake the belief that nobody could truly see beyond my disability and accept me for who i am  
 i also really struggled to comprehend that i was a man  the first time someone referred to me as a man it stopped me in my tracks  
  like looking around and asking who me 
 that all changed with joan  we have an amazing connection and i learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly  
 i felt safe  and it gave me the confidence to truly say what i thought i started to feel whole again  a man worthy of love 
 i began to reshape my destiny
  a little more at work  i asserted my need for independence to the people around me  
 being given a means of communication changed everything  
 i used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions of those around me and those i had of myself 
 communication is what makes us human
  enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us
 telling our own stories expressing wants  needs and desires or hearing those of others by really listening 
 all this is how the world knows who we are so who are we without it 
 true communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world 
 once i was perceived to be an inanimate object
  a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair  
 today  i am so much more a husband  a son  a friend  a brother  a business owner  a first class honors graduate  
 a keen amateur photographer  it is my ability to communicate that has given me all this 
 we are told that actions speak louder than words  but i wonder
  do they 
 our words however we communicate them are just as powerful  
 whether we speak the words with our own voices  type them with our eyes or communicate them non verbally to someone who speaks them for us words are among our most powerful tools  
 i have come to you through a terrible darkness  pulled from it by caring souls
 by language itself  
 the act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light we are shining here together  
 if there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating  it is that sometimes i want to shout and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude  
  all sounds the same  but if you will  please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can  
 thank you
