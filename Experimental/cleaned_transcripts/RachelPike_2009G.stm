  i 'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper 
 headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and like this when they have to do with air quality or smog they 're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science 
 recently the headlines looked like this when the
  intergovernmental panel on climate change  or ipcc put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system 
 that report was written by six hundred and twenty scientists from forty countries they wrote almost one thousand pages on the topic  
 and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400 plus scientists and reviewers from one hundred and thirteen countries  it 's a big community  such a big
  in fact that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world over fifteen thousand scientists go to san francisco every year for that
 every one of those scientists is in a research group and every research group studies a wide variety of topics for us at cambridge it 's as varied as the el nio oscillation which affects weather and climate to the 
  assimilation of satellite data to emissions from crops that produce biofuels which is what i study 
  there are phd students like me  and we study incredibly narrow topics things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules 
 and one of the molecules i study is called isoprene which is here it 's a small organic molecule you 've probably never heard of it the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to nine hundred zeta illion
  ten to the 21st molecules of isoprene  but despite its very small weight  enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet  it 's a huge amount of stuff it 's equal to the weight of methane and because it 's so
  much stuff it 's really important for the atmospheric system  because it 's important to the atmospheric system  we go to all lengths to study this thing  we blow it up and look at the pieces this is the euphore smog chamber 
  in spain atmospheric explosions or full combustion takes about fifteen thousand times longer than what happens in your car  but still we look at the pieces  we run enormous models on supercomputers
  this is what i happen to do our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each on minute timescales it takes weeks to perform our integrations  and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening 
 we also fly all over the world looking for this thing i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia there are others  we found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of scientific
  off this tower to look for isoprene and other things while we were there this is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above and the tower from below
 on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us  and this plane the model 
  run by faam  normally flies one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty people so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today but we didn 't just fly it we were flying at one hundred meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule
 incredibly dangerous stuff  we have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering we need special flight clearance as you come around the banks in these valleys the forces 
  can get up to two gs  the scientists must be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while on board so as you can imagine the inside of the aircraft doesn 't look like one you 'd take on vacation  
  sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule they write one scientific paper on the subject and out of that field campaign we 'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules
 as a body of knowledge builds up it will form one subsection or one 
 of an assessment like the ipcc although we have others  and each one of the eleven chapters of the
  six to ten subsections so you can imagine the scale of the effort 
 in each one of the assessments we write we always tag on a summary and the summary is written for a non scientific audience  and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these  
 thank you very much
