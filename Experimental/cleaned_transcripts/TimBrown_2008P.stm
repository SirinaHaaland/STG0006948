  a guy named bob mckim he was a creativity researcher in the ' 60s and ' 70s and also led the
 stanford design program and in fact my friend and ideo
  studied under him at stanford and
 he
 liked to do an exercise with his students
 where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them their neighbor  
 very quickly just as quickly as they could  and in fact were going to do that exercise right now  you all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper
  bunch of circles on it  i need you to turn that piece of paper over you should find that its blank on the other side   and there should be a pencil  and
 i want you to pick somebody thats seated next to you and when i say go youve got thirty seconds to draw your neighbor
  seconds youd better be fast come on those masterpieces
  i think i probably am
 and thats exactly thats exactly what happens every time every time you do this with adults  mckim found this every time he did it with his students he got exactly the same
  he would point this out as evidence
 that we fear the judgment of our peers  and that were embarrassed about showing our ideas
 to to people we think of as our peers to those around us
 and this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our
  so we might have a wild idea but were afraid to share it with with anybody else  ok so if you try the same exercise with kids they have no embarrassment at all 
 they just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever whoever wants to
 wants to look at it  but as they learn to become adults they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others 
  they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed
 and in studies of of kids playing its been shown time after time that
 kids who feel secure  who are in a kind of trusted environment theyre the ones that feel
 feel most free to play  and if youre starting a design firm lets say  then you probably also want to create
 a place where people have the same kind of
  security where they have the same kind of security to take risks maybe have the same kind of security to play  
 before founding ideo  david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company
 where all the employees are my best friends now  that wasnt just
  he knew that friendship is a short short cut to play  and
 he knew that it gives us a sense of trust  and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers and so that decision to
 work with his friends now he has five hundred and fifty of them
 was was what got
  and our studios like i think many creative workplaces today are designed to help people
 feel relaxed  familiar with their surroundings  comfortable with the people that theyre working with 
 it takes more than decor but  i think weve all seen that
 creative companies
 do often have
  symbols in the workplace that 
 remind people to be playful 
 and that its a permissive environment so whether its this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at ideo  or at pixar where the animators work in
 wooden huts and decorated caves  or at the googleplex where its famous for its [ beach ] volleyball courts  and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on
  dont know the reason for the pink flamingos  but anyway theyre there in the garden  or even in the swiss office of google which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all and my theory is thats so the swiss can prove to their californian colleagues that theyre not boring  so they have the slide and they even have a 
 what they do with that but they have one  so all of these places have these symbols now  our big symbol
 at ideo is actually not so much the place  its a thing  and its actually something that we invented a few years ago or created a few years ago its a toy
  its called a finger blaster and i forgot to bring one up with me so if somebody can reach under the chair thats next to them  youll find something taped underneath it thats great if you could pass it up thanks david i appreciate it 
 so this is a finger blaster  and
 you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair  and im going to run a little experiment 
 another little experiment but before we start i need just
  to put these on thank you 
 all right now
  what im going to do is im going to see how i cant see out of these ok  im going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage   so the way they work is you know
 you just
 put your finger in the thing  pull them back and off you go so  
  my only recommendation here i want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage
  theyre still coming in from the back there theyre still coming in some of you havent fired them yet can you not figure out how to do it or something its not that
 hard most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first ten seconds when they pick it up all
 right  this is pretty good  this is pretty good  okay all right lets
 i suppose we 'd better i
  the rest of you can save them for when i say something particularly boring and then you can fire at me all right i think im going to take these off now because i cant see a damn thing when ive
 all right
  so we have the finger blasters other people have dinosaurs  you know why do we have them well as i said we have them because we think maybe playfulness
 is is important but why is it important  
 we use it in a pretty pragmatic way to be honest
  we think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions helps us do our jobs better and helps us feel better when when we do them now
  an adult encountering a new situation
 when we encounter a new situation we we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can you know
 and theres a reason for that
  we want to settle on an answer lifes complicated we want to figure out whats going on around us very quickly  i suspect
  that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [ for ] why we want to categorize new things
 very very quickly one of them might be you know when we see this funny stripy thing
 is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us or is it just some weird shadows on the tree we need to figure that out pretty fast well at least we did once most of us dont need to anymore i suppose this is some aluminum foil right you use it in the kitchen thats what it is
  now theyll certainly when they come across something new theyll certainly ask 
 what is it of course they will but theyll also ask what can i do with it and you know 
 the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example  and this openness is the beginning of exploratory play
 any parents of young kids in the audience
 our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them  and
 you know from an exploration perspective 
 this behavior makes complete sense because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy even one like say  tickle me elmo which despite its ingenuity
  really only does one thing  whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices  
 so again this is another one of those playful activities that as we get older we tend to forget and we have to relearn
  so another one of bob mckims favorite exercises is called the thirty circles test so were back to work you guys are going to get back to work again
  turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over and youll find those
  printed on the piece of paper so it should look like this you should be looking at something like this so what im going to do is im going to give you minute  
 and i want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form so for example you could turn one into a football
 or another one into a sun all im interested in is quantity i want you to do as many of them as you can in the minute that im just about to give you so everybody ready
  put down your pencils as they say  
 so who got more than five circles figured out  hopefully everybody more than ten keep your hands up if you did ten fifteen
 anybody get all thirty no oh somebody did fantastic 
 did anybody to a variation on a theme like a smiley face  happy face  sad face sleepy face  anybody do that
  anybody use my examples  the sun and the football great  cool
  so i was really interested in quantity i wasnt actually very interested in whether they were all different i just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible
  and one of the things we tend to do as adults again is
 we edit things we stop ourselves from doing things we self edit as were having ideas and in some cases our desire to be original
 is actually a form of editing  and
 that actually isnt necessarily really really playful so that ability just to just to go for it and explore
  lots of things even if they dont seem that different from each other is actually something that kids do well and it is a form of play  
 so now bob mckim did another version of this test in a in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s anybody know what this is  
 its the peyote
  its the plant from which you can create mescaline one of the psychedelic drugs for those of you around in the ' 60s you probably know it well  mckim published a paper in one thousand nine 
 describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity
  them to come along one evening and to bring a problem
 with them that they that they were working on 
 he gave each of them some mescaline  and had them listen to some nice relaxing music for a while
  and then he did
 whats called the purdue
  how many uses can you find for a paper clip its basically the same thing as the thirty circles thing that i just had you do
  now actually he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs to see
 what the difference was in peoples
 facility and speed with coming up coming up with ideas  and then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that
  that theyd been working on  and so some of the things that they figured out some of these individuals figured out in one case a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients 
 a design of a solar space probe experiment a redesign of the linear electron accelerator 
 an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder you can tell this is a while ago
  completion of a line of furniture  and even a new conceptual model of the photon so it was a pretty successful evening 
 in fact  maybe this experiment was the reason that silicon valley got off to its great start with innovation  we dont know but it may be we need to ask some of the ceos whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment  but really it wasnt the drugs
 that were important it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking  and getting them
  to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas  
 but its hard to break our habits our adult habits 
 at ideo we have brainstorming brainstorming rules written on the walls  edicts like defer judgment 
 or go for quantity and somehow that seems wrong i mean  can you have rules about creativity
  it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise
 we might bring to the creative process and weve certainly learnt that over time you get much better brainstorming much more creative outcomes
 when everybody does play by the rules now of course many designers many individual designers  achieve this is in a much more organic way i think the 
  are wonderful examples of experimentation and they experimented with
  plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind  they were exploring following
 what was interesting to them 
 they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war i think and from this experiment they moved on to chairs through constant experimentation with materials they developed a wide range of iconic solutions
 we know today eventually resulting in of course the legendary lounge chair now if the eameses had stopped with that first great solution  then we wouldnt be the beneficiaries of so many
 wonderful designs today
  and of course they used experimentation in all aspects of their work  from films to buildings from
 games to graphics so theyre great examples i think of exploration and experimentation in design now while the
 the  eameses were exploring those possibilities they were also exploring physical objects  and they were doing that through building prototypes and building is the next of the behaviors that i thought id talk about 
 so the average
 western first grader spends as much as fifty percent of their play time taking part in whats called construction
  but also a powerful way to learn
 when play is about building a tower out of blocks the kid begins to learn a lot about towers and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again
 learning is happening as a sort of by product of play its classically learning by doing
  now  david kelley calls this behavior when its carried out by designers thinking with your hands and it typically involves
  making multiple low resolution prototypes very quickly often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution 
 on one of his earliest projects  the team was kind of stuck and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together
 a prototype made from a roll on deodorant  now  that became the first commercial computer mouse for the apple lisa and the macintosh
 learned their way
 to that by building by building prototypes 
 another example is a group of of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons  they were meeting with them they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device 
  and one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium and a clothespin he taped them all together ran back
  into the room and said you mean something like this and the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said well i want to hold it like this or like that and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design
 around a tangible
 a tangible object  and in the end it turned into
 a real device and so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world and having your thinking advanced as a result
  at ideo theres a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment  the prototyping carts  filled with
 colored paper and play doh and glue sticks and stuff i mean they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them but the important idea is that everythings at hand everythings around so when designers are working on ideas they can start building stuff
 whenever they want they dont necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal
  workshop to do it and we think thats pretty important  
 and then the sad thing is although preschools are full of this kind of stuff 
 as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away they lose this stuff that facilitates this sort
 of playful and building mode of thinking  and of course by the time you get to the average workplace  
 maybe the best construction tool we have might be the
 but by giving project teams
 and
  and the clients who theyre working with permission to think with their hands  quite complex ideas can can
 spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily  this is a nurse using a very simple as you can see plasticine
  explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her
 in a hospital and just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way 
 and of course by building quick prototypes  we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if were trying to describe them
 through through words
  but what about designing something that isnt physical something like a service or an experience something that exists as a series of interactions over time instead of 
 of building play this can be approached with role play so if youre designing an interaction between two people such as i dont know ordering
 food at a fast food joint or something you need to be able to imagine how that experience
  might feel over a period of time  and i think the best way to achieve that and get a feeling for any flaws in your design is to act it out
  so we do quite a lot of work at ideo trying to convince our clients of this they can be a little skeptical ill come back to that  
 but a place  i think where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems
 things like education or security or finance or health  and this is another example in a healthcare
  environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care but you know  many adults are pretty reluctant to engage
 with role play some of its embarrassment and some of it is because they just dont believe that what emerges is necessarily valid
 they dismiss an interesting interaction by saying you know thats just happening because theyre acting it out research into kids ' behavior actually suggests that its worth
  taking role playing seriously  
 because when children play a role  they actually follow social scripts quite closely that theyve learnt from us as adults  if one kid plays store and another ones playing house then the whole kind of play falls down so they get used to
 quite quickly to
 to understanding the rules for social
  actually quite quick to point out when theyre broken  
 so when as adults we role play 
 then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized weve gone through lots of experiences in life 
 and they provide a strong intuition intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work  so were very good when acting out a solution  
 at spotting whether something lacks
  quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences another way for us as designers to explore role play is to put ourselves
 through an experience which were designing for
 and project ourselves into an experience  so here are some designers  who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane  and so they grabbed some very simple
  just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite  quite small places on on airplanes this is one of our designers kristian simsarian and hes 
  putting himself through the experience of being an er patient now this is a real hospital in a real emergency room one of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didnt want the doctors and nurses thinking
  he was actually sick and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later so anyhow  he went there with his video camera
  and its kind of interesting to see what he brought back because when we when we looked at the video when he got back we saw twenty minutes of this 
 and also the amazing thing about this about this video as soon as you see it you immediately project
  know what it feels like all of that uncertainty while youre left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case
 in one of the emergency rooms wondering what the hecks going on  and so this notion of using 
 or in this case living through the experience as a way of creating empathy particularly when you use video is really powerful  or another one of our designers altay sendil hes here having his chest waxed not because hes very vain although actually he is no
 im kidding
 but in order to empathize with
  pain that chronic care patients go through when theyre having dressings removed  
 and so sometimes these analogous experiences analogous role play can also be quite valuable so
 when a kid dresses up as a firefighter  you know hes beginning to try on that identity he wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter were doing the same thing as designers were trying on these experiences  
 and so the idea of
  as an empathy tool as well as a tool for prototyping experiences  and you know  we kind of admire
 people who do this
 at ideo anyway not just because they lead to insights about the experience but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves
 to the experience in short we admire their willingness to play
 playful exploration playful building and role play those are some of the ways that designers
 use play in their work  and so far i admit 
 this might feel like its a message just to go out and play like a kid  and to certain extent it is
  i want to stress a couple of points the first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy
 play has rules especially when its group play 
 when kids play tea party or they play cops and robbers theyre following a script that theyve agreed to 
 and its this code negotiation
 that leads to productive play  so remember the sketching task we did at the beginning the kind of little face
  portrait you did well imagine
 if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist 
  bought the next round of drinks that framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing difficult situation into a fun game as a result
  all feel perfectly secure and and have a good
  but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together  but there arent just
 rules about how to play  there are rules about when to play  kids dont play all the time  obviously
  they transition in and out of it and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences  as designers
 we need to be able to transition in and out of play also and if were running design studios we need to be able to figure out how can we transition designers through
 through these different experiences  i think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of i think whats very different about design
 is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation  we go through
 a sort of generative mode where were exploring many ideas  and then we come back together again
 come back looking for that solution and developing that solution  i think theyre two quite different modes
 divergence and convergence  and i think its probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness 
 perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious and so being able to move between those modes is really really
  a more nuanced version view of play i think is required because its very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute youre either playful or youre serious and you cant be both
  but
 thats not really true you can be a serious professional adult and at times be playful  its not an either or
  trust to play  and we need trust to be creative  so theres a connection  
 and there are a series of behaviors that weve learnt as kids  and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers  they include exploration 
 which is about going for quantity 
 building and thinking with your
  where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which were designing and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic
