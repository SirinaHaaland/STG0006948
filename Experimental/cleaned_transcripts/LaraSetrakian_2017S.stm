  five years ago  i had my dream job 
 i was a foreign correspondent in the middle east reporting for abc news  but there was a crack in the wall a problem with our industry 
 that i felt we needed to fix 
 you see i got to the middle east
  east right around the end of two thousand and seven  which was just around the midpoint of the iraq war  
 but by the time i got there it was already nearly impossible to find stories about iraq on air
 coverage had dropped across the board across networks  and of the stories that did make it 
 more than eighty percent of them were about us we were missing the stories about iraq
  the people who live there 
 and what was happening to them under the weight of the war  
 afghanistan had already fallen off the agenda 
 there were less than one percent of all news stories in two thousand and eight that went to the war in afghanistan 
 it was the longest war in us history  but information was so scarce that schoolteachers we spoke to
 told us they had trouble explaining
  to their students what we were doing there when those students had parents who were fighting and sometimes dying overseas  
 we had drawn a blank  and it wasn 't just iraq and afghanistan from conflict zones to climate change to
 all sorts of issues around crises in public health
  we were missing what i call the 
  issues because as a species they could actually sink us and by failing to understand the complex issues of our time  
 we were facing certain practical implications 
 how were we going to solve problems that we didn 't fundamentally understand that we couldn 't track in real time  and where the people working on the issues were invisible to us and sometimes invisible to each other 
  back on iraq 
 those years when we were missing the story 
 were the years when the society was falling apart when we were setting the conditions for what would become the rise of isis the isis takeover of mosul and terrorist violence that would spread beyond iraq 's borders to the rest of the world 
  that time where i was making that observation i looked across the border of iraq and noticed there was another story we were missing 
 the war in syria if you were a middle east specialist you knew that syria was that important from the start  
 but it ended up being really one of the forgotten stories of the arab spring  
 i saw the implications up front  syria is intimately tied to regional security to global stability  i felt like
  we couldn 't let that become another one of the stories we left behind  
 so i left my big tv job to start a website  called syria deeply 
 it was designed to be a news and information source that made it easier to understand a complex issue  and for the past four years it 's been a resource for policymakers and professionals working on the conflict in syria 
 we built a business
  model based on consistent high quality information and convening the top minds on the issue  
 and we found it was a model that scaled we got passionate requests to do other things deeply 
 so we started to work our way down the list  
 i 'm just one
  of many entrepreneurs and we are just one of many start ups trying to fix what 's wrong with news 
 all of us in the trenches know that something is wrong with the news industry  it 's broken  
 trust in the media has hit an all time low and the statistic you 're seeing up there is from september
 it 's arguably gotten worse but we can fix this we can fix the news  i know that that 's true  you can call me
 an idealist  i call myself an industrious optimist  and i know there are a lot of us out there  
 we have ideas for how to make things better  and i want to share three of them that we 've picked up in our own work 
 idea number one  
 we need news that 's built on deep domain knowledge given the waves and waves of layoffs at newsrooms across the country we 've lost the art of specialization
 beat reporting is an endangered thing when it comes to foreign news 
 the way we can fix that is by working with more local journalists treating them like our partners and collaborators not just fixers who fetch us phone numbers and sound bites 
 our local reporters in syria and across africa and across asia bring us stories that we certainly would not have found on our own 
 like this one from the suburbs of
  damascus  about a wheelchair race that gave hope to those wounded in the war  
 or this one from sierra leone about a local chief who curbed the spread of ebola by  self organizing a quarantine in his district  
 or this one from the border of pakistan about afghan refugees being forced to return home before they
  under the threat of police intimidation 
 our local journalists are our mentors they teach us something new every day  and they bring us stories that are important for all of us to know 
 idea number two  we need a kind of hippocratic oath for the news industry  a pledge to first
 do no harm journalists need to be tough
  we need to speak truth to power  but we also need to be responsible we need to live up to our own ideals  and we need to recognize
 when what we 're doing
 could potentially harm society where we lose track of journalism as a public service
  i watched us cover the ebola crisis we launched ebola deeply we did our best but what we saw was a public that was flooded with hysterical and sensational coverage sometimes inaccurate sometimes completely wrong 
  health experts tell me that that actually cost us in human lives  because by sparking more panic and by sometimes getting the facts wrong we made it harder for people 
  to resolve what was actually happening on the ground all that noise made it harder to make the right decisions 
  go that way next time 
 it 's a choice  we have to resist the temptation to use fear for ratings and that decision has to be made in the individual newsroom and with the individual news executive  
 because the next deadly virus that comes around could be much worse
 and the consequences much higher  if we do what we did last time  if our reporting isn 't responsible and it isn 't right
 the third idea  we need to embrace complexity if we want to make sense of a complex world  
 embrace complexity 
 not treat the world simplistically  because simple isn 't accurate  we live in a complex world news
  our job as journalists to get elbow deep in complexity and to find new ways to make it easier for everyone else to understand 
 if we don 't do that if we pretend there are just simple answers we 're leading everyone off a steep cliff 
 understanding complexity is the only way to know the real threats that are around the corner it 's our responsibility to translate those threats and to help you understand what 's real so you can be prepared
 and know what it takes to
  be ready for what comes next  
 i am an industrious optimist  i do believe we can fix what 's broken  
 we all want to there are great journalists out there doing great work we just need new formats  
 i honestly believe
 this is a time of reawakening  reimagining what we can do i believe we can fix what 's broken  i know we can fix the news
  know it 's worth trying  and i truly believe that in the end we 're going to get this right
