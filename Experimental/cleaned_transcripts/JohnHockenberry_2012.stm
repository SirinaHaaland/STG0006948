  my dad was which is kind of an interesting way to grow up i had to figure out what it is my dad
 did and why it was important  dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing
  up you know bad design is is just people not thinking john he would say
 whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or say a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen  you know
 bad design there 's just no excuse for it it 's letting stuff happen
 without thinking about it every object should be about something john  it should imagine a user it should cast that user in a story starring the user 
 and the object good design my dad said is about supplying intent 
  for steelcase  that was important  i knew design was important in my house because for heaven 's sake  it put food on our table right  and design was in everything my dad did 
 he had a dixieland jazz band when we were growing up  
 and he would always cover louis armstrong tunes  and i would ask him every once in a while dad do you want it to sound like the record we had lots of old jazz records lying around the house and he said
  the song is just a given that 's how you have to think about it you gotta make it your own  you gotta design it  show everyone what you intend is what he said doing that  acting by design is what we all should be doing  
 it 's where we all belong all of us
  given
 it 's how you cover it that matters well  let 's hold on to that thought for just a minute  it 's kind of like this wheelchair i 'm in right 
 the original tune it 's a little scary ooh  what happened to that dude  he can 't walk  anybody know the story  
 anybody 
 i don 't like to talk about this very much but i 'll tell you guys the story today
  this week that 's right i was in a poorly designed automobile that hit a poorly designed guardrail
 on a poorly designed road in pennsylvania  and plummeted
 down a 200 foot embankment and killed two people
 in the car  but ever since then the wheelchair has been a given in my life  my life at the mercy of good design
 and bad design  
 think about it now in design terms a wheelchair is a very difficult object  
 it mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune and it projects that message that story so strongly that it almost blots out anything else  i roll swiftly through an airport right and moms grab their kids out of the way
 has this terrified look on his face god knows what they think and for for decades i 'm going why does this happen what can i do about it how can i change this i mean there must be something so 
  i i would roll i 'd make no eye contact just kinda frown right  or i 'd
  i wouldn 't shower for a week nothing worked 
 nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that i had and they said oh dad dad look you gotta get these these flashy wheels you gotta get
  all and
 of course they immediately concluded oh 
 what a bummer dad journalists aren 't allowed to have flashy wheels i mean  how important could you be then 
 they said 
  all right right i 'll get the wheels purely out of protest i got the flashy wheels and
  so what you are looking at here has completely changed my life  i mean totally changed my life instead of blank stares and 
  awkwardness now it is pointing and smiling people going
  wheels dude those are awesome  i mean i want some of those wheels little kids say can i have a ride 
 and of course there 's the occasional person usually a middle aged male who will say oh those wheels are great  i guess they 're for safety right
  what 's the difference here the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights the difference
 is intent  that 's right  that 's right i 'm no longer a victim  i chose to change the situation i 'm the commander of the starship wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the
  i choose to enhance this rolling experience with a simple design element  
 acting with intent it conveys authorship it suggests that someone is driving it
 's reassuring people are drawn to it  someone making the experience their own  covering the tragic tune
  with something different something radically different 
 people respond to that  
 now it seems simple but actually i think in our society and culture in general we have a huge problem with intent now go with me here look
 at this guy  you know who this is it 's anders breivik now if he
  norway last year  dozens and dozens of young people
 if he intended to do that he 's a vicious criminal  we punish him life in prison death penalty in the united states not so much in norway 
 but if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy  if he was motivated by some random
 mental illness  he 's in a completely different category we may put him away for life but
 we watch him clinically
 it 's a completely different domain as an intentional murderer  anders breivik is
 is merely evil  but as a dysfunctional as a dysfunctional murderer psychotic  he 's something much more complicated he 's the breath
 of some primitive ancient chaos  he 's the random state of nature we emerged from he 's something very
  very different  it 's as though intent is an essential component for humanity  it 's what we 're supposed to do somehow  we 're supposed to act with intent  we 're supposed to do things by design  
 intent
 is a marker for civilization 
 now here 's an example a little closer to home my family is all about intent  you can probably tell there are two sets of twins
 the result of ivf technology in vitro fertilization technology due to some physical limitations i won 't go into anyway in vitro
 technology ivf is about as intentional as agriculture  let me tell you some of you may have the experience 
 in fact the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal  cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian  
 i met the dude  he 's a great guy
  this big leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he 'd worked with all the different animals probes he designed 
 and in fact he was really really proud of these probes he would say you 're right between horse and squirrel john
  wife and i decided to upgrade our early middle age we had four kids after all with a little different technology that i won 't explain in too much detail here my urologist
  assured me i had nothing whatsoever to worry about no need for birth control doc are you sure about that 
 of birth control well 
 laughter what a liberating thought
 yes and after a couple very liberating weekends my wife and i utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won 't get into it now
  we
 noticed some familiar if unexpected symptoms  i wasn 't exactly a form of birth control
  look at that font there my wife was so pissed i mean did a designer come up with that no i don 't think a designer did come up with that 
 in fact maybe that 's the problem and so little ajax was
  he 's like our other children but the experience is completely different 
 it 's something like my accident  right  he came out of nowhere  
 but we all had to change  but not just react to the given  we bend to this new experience with intent  
 we 're five now
 five facing the given with intent
  doing things by design  hey  the name ajax you can 't get much more intentional than that right we 're really hoping he thanks us for that
 later on 
 but i never became a designer no no no no never attempted never even close
 i did love some great designs as i was growing up the hp 35s calculator god i loved that thing oh god i wish i had one
  i love that thing i could afford that  other designs i really couldn 't afford like the one thousand nine hundred and seventy four nine hundred and eleven targa 
 in school i studied nothing close to design or engineering i studied useless things like the classics  but there were some lessons even there
 this guy  plato it turns out he 's a designer 
 he designed a state in the republic a design never implemented listen to one of the design features of plato 's government four point
 the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager  the worst 
 well got that wrong didn 't we 
 but look at that statement it 's all about intent that 's what i love about it  but consider what plato is doing here what is he doing  it 's a grand idea of design a huge idea
  of design  common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the classical period what was going on then  
 they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive as the human race emerged from a prehistoric 
 chaos a confrontation with random brutal nature 
  moment to think and there was a lot to think about all of a sudden  human existence needed an intent  
 human life needed a reason  reality itself needed a designer the given was replaced by various aspects of intent  
 by various designs by various gods 
 gods we 're still fighting about
 oh yeah  
 today we don 't confront the chaos of nature  today it is the chaos of humanity 's impact on the earth itself that we confront 
 this young discipline called design i think 
 is in fact the emerging ethos formulating and then answering a very new question what shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created
  what shall we do 
 how shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create on all the circumstances we create 
 on all the places we change the consequences of a planet with seven billion people and counting  
 that 's the tune we 're all covering today all of us and we can 't just imitate the past no  
 that won 't do
 that won 't do at all 
 here 's my favorite design moment 
 in the city of kinshasa in zaire in the 1990s i was working for abc news and i was reporting on the fall of mobutu sese seko the dictator the brutal dictator in zaire who raped and pillaged that country there was rioting in the middle of kinshasa  the
  a horrible horrible place and i needed to go and
 and explore the center of kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting people were carrying off vehicles carrying off pieces of buildings soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests 
 in the middle of this chaos  i 'm rolling around in a wheelchair  and i was completely invisible 
 completely  i was in a wheelchair i didn 't look like a looter i
 was in a wheelchair i didn 't look like
  a journalist  particularly at least from their perspective  and i didn 't look like a soldier that 's for sure 
 i was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of zaire completely invisible 
 and all of a sudden  from around a corner comes this young man paralyzed just like me in this metal and wood
  and i looked at him  he didn 't know any other english than that but we didn 't need english no no no no no 
 we sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes  and i looked at his whacky pedal mechanism
  he was full of pride over his design i wish i could show you that contraption 
 his smile our glow as we talked a universal language
 of design  
 invisible to the chaos around us 
 his machine homemade bolted  rusty  comical my machine  american made confident sleek  
 he was particularly proud of the comfortable seat really comfortable seat he had made in his
 chariot
 and its
 beautiful fabric fringe around the edge oh i wish i 'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him man  he would have loved those oh yeah  
 he would have understood those a chariot of pure intent think about it
 in a city out of control design blew it all away for a moment  we spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos
  he went back to the streets of kinshasa  i went to my hotel  and i think of him now  now  
 and i pose this question an object imbued with intent
 it has power  it 's treasure we 're drawn to it  an object devoid of intent it 's random
  it repels us it 's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away this
 is what we must demand
 of our lives of our objects of our things of our circumstances  living
 with intent  and i have to say
 that on that score i have a very unfair advantage over all of you
  want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day thirty six years ago
 at nearly this moment  a 19 year old boy awoke from a coma
 to ask a nurse a question  but the nurse was already there with an answer you 've had a terrible accident young man you 've broken your
  i know all that what day is it 
 you see  i knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of february  and i knew
  got some catching up to do and from that moment  i knew
 the given was that accident  i had no option
 but to make up this new life without walking intent
 a life with intent lived by design  covering the original with something better
  it 's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times 
 to get back to this to get back to design 
 and as my daddy suggested a long time ago make the song your own  john  show everybody what you intend
  to get back to
  a lot
