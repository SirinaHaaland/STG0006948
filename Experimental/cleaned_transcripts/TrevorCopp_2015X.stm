  dancing with the stars first hit the airwaves that is not what it looked like 
 laughter jeff and i were full time ballroom dance instructors when the big tv ballroom revival hit and
 was incredible i mean one day we would say foxtrot and people were like foxes trotting 
 laughter and the next day they were telling us the finer points of a good feather step  and
 this blew our minds i mean  all of the ballroom dance
  that we had always done on why salsa worked differently than the competitive rumba and why tango traveled unlike the waltz all of that
 just hit the public consciousness and it changed everything 
 but running parallel to this excitement the excitement that suddenly somehow we were cool 
 laughter there was also this reservation why this and why now
 when trevor and i would get together for training seminars or just for fun  we 'd toss each other around  mix it up take a break from having to lead all the time  
 we even came up with a system for switching lead and follow while we were dancing as a way of taking turns and playing fair
 it wasn 't until we used that system as part of a performance in a small festival that we got an important tap on the shoulder lisa o 'connell a dramaturge and director of a
  center pulled us aside after the show and said do you have any idea how political that was so
 that began an eight year collaboration to create a play which not only further developed our system for switching
 but also explored the impact of being locked into a single role and what 's worse being defined by that single role
 isn 't just a system of dancing  it 's a way of thinking of being 
 of relating to each other that captured a whole period 's values there 's one thing that stayed consistent though  
 the man leads and the woman follows  so street salsa championship tango it 's all the same he leads she
  so this was gender training you weren 't just learning to dance you were learning to man and to woman 
 it 's a relic  and in the way of relics you don 't throw it out but you need to know that this is the past this isn 't the present  
 it 's like shakespeare respect it revive it great  but know that this is history this doesn 't represent how we think today  
 so we asked ourselves if you strip it all down
 what is at the core of partner dancing jf well
 the core principle of partner dancing is that one person leads  the other one follows  
 the machine works the same regardless of who 's playing which role  the physics of movement doesn 't really give a crap about your gender 
 laughter so if we were to update the existing form we would need to make it more representative
  when you watch ballroom don 't just watch what 's there watch what 's not the couple is always only a man and a woman together 
 only 
 ever so same sex and gender nonconformist couples just disappear 
 in most mainstream international ballroom competitions same sex couples are rarely recognized on the floor and in many cases the rules prohibit them completely
 professional latin dancer and then look for an actual latino person 
 you 'll be there for days
  what you will get is page after page of white straight russian couples spray tanned to the point of mahogany 
 there are no black people there are no asians no mixed race
  she can 't be taller he can 't be shorter she can 't be bolder he can 't be gentler 
 if you were to take a ballroom dance and translate that into a conversation and drop that into a movie we as a culture  would never stand for this he dictates she reacts
 no relationship
 gay straight or anything that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that and yet somehow 
 you put it on prime time you slap some makeup on it throw the glitter on put it out there as movement not as text 
 and we as a culture  tune in and clap
  we are applauding our own absence too many people have disappeared from partner dancing
  you just saw two men dancing together and you thought it looked a little strange  interesting appealing even
 but a little bit odd  even avid followers of the same sex ballroom circuit can
  partner dancing can be dynamic and strong and exciting it just doesn 't quite seem to fit  aesthetically speaking if alida and i
 take the classic closed ballroom hold 
 this is considered beautiful 
 but why not this see the
 standard image that the leader must be larger and masculine and the follower smaller and feminine
 this is a stumbling point tc so we wanted to look at this
 from a totally different angle 
 so what if we could keep the idea of lead and follow but toss the idea that this was connected to gender  
 further 
 what if a couple could lead and follow each other
 and then switch and then switch back what
  it could be like a conversation taking turns listening and speaking just like we do in life what if
 we could dance like that we call it liquid lead dancing jf 
 let 's try this with a latin dance salsa  in salsa there 's a key transitional
  we use it as punctuation to break up the improvisation it can be a little tricky to spot if you 're not used to looking for it so here it is 
 one more time for the cheap seats 
 and here 's the action one more time  nice and slow
  if we apply liquid lead thinking to this transitional step 
 the cross body lead becomes a point where the lead and the follow can switch the person following can elect to take over the lead or the person leading can choose to surrender it essentially making it a 
  lead here 's how that looks in slow motion
  and here 's how it looked when we danced it in the opening dance 
 with this simple tweak the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation  
 anyone can lead  anyone can follow  and more importantly you can change your mind  
  this is only one example of how this applies but once the blinkers come off anything can happen 
 tc let 's look at how liquid lead thinking could apply to a classic waltz  because of course it isn 't just a system of switching leads  
 it 's a way of thinking that can actually make the dance itself more efficient so the waltz  
 the waltz is a turning dance this means that for the
  you spend half of the dance traveling backwards completely blind  and because of the follower 's position 
 basically  no one can see where they 're going so
 you 're out here on the floor  and then imagine that coming right at you 
 there are actually a lot of accidents out there that happen as a result of this blind
  but what if the partners were to just allow for a switch of posture for a moment a lot of accidents could be avoided  
 even if one person led the whole dance but allowed this switch to happen it
 would be a lot safer while at the same time offering new aesthetics into the waltz  
 because physics doesn 't give a damn about your gender jf now 
  we 've danced liquid lead in clubs convention centers and as part of first dance the play we created with lisa on stages in north america and in europe  
 and it never fails to engage 
 i mean beyond the unusual sight of seeing two men dancing together it always evokes and engages  but why 
 the secret lies in what made lisa see our initial demonstration as political it wasn 't just that we were switching lead and follow
  it 's that we stayed consistent in our presence our personality and our power  regardless of which role we were playing we were still us 
 and that 's where the true freedom lies
 not just the freedom to switch roles but the freedom from being defined by whichever role you 're playing 
 the freedom to always remain true to yourself  forget what a lead is supposed to look like or a follow be a masculine follow or a feminine lead
  just be yourself  
 obviously this applies off the dance floor as well  but on the floor it gives us the perfect opportunity to update an old paradigm 
 reinvigorate an old relic  and make it more representative of our era
 and our current way of being tc 
 jeff and i dance partner dancing all the time with women and men and we love it but we dance with a consciousness that this is a historic form
 that can produce silence and produce invisibility
 across the spectrum of identity that we enjoy today  
 we invented liquid lead as a way of stripping out all the ideas that don 't belong to us
 and taking partner dancing back
 to what it really always was the fine art of taking care of each other
