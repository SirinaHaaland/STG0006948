  i 've been interested in food for a long time i taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this i went to chef school in france and
  the world writes about food and learns about food 
 and it 's largely what you would find in these books  
 and it 's a wonderful thing  but there 's some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established
  in the last twenty years people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food 
 in fact understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking some of the chemistry
 and so forth 
 but that 's not in any of those books  there 's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed some about new aesthetics new approaches to food there 's a chef in spain 
  named ferran adria he 's developed a very avant garde cuisine a guy in england called heston blumenthal he 's developed his  avant garde cuisine
  none of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last twenty years is in any of those books  none of them are taught in cooking schools 
 in order to learn them you have to go work in those restaurants  
 and finally  there 's the old way of viewing food is the old way  
 and so a few years ago fours years ago actually i set out to say is there a way we can communicate science and technique
  a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before  so we tried and i 'll show you what we came up with 
 this is a picture called a cutaway this is actually the first picture i took in the book  the idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli  and this magic view allows you to see all of what 's happening while the broccoli steams 
 then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact  
 and the hope was two fold one is you can actually explain what
  happens when you steam broccoli  
 but the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical maybe a little bit more scientific maybe a little bit more chef y than they otherwise would have because with 
  that beautiful photo maybe i can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time steaming ought to
  it turns out it isn 't because of something called film condensation  and this explains that 
 well that first cutaway picture worked  
 so we said okay  let 's do some more so here 's another one we discovered why woks are the shape they are 
 this shaped wok doesn 't work very well this caught fire three times  
 but we had a philosophy which is it only has to look good for a thousandth
  one of our canning cutaways  once you start cutting things in half you kind of get carried away so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan  
 and each of these text blocks explains a key thing that 's going on in this case boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic 
 you don 't have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning
 because
 bacterial spores can 't grow in the acid so this is great for
  vegetables which is what we 're canning here 
 here 's our hamburger cutaway 
 one of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish so you can lavish all the same care all the same technique 
 on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish 
 and if you do lavish as much technique as possible and you try to make the highest quality
  it gets to be a little bit involved  the new york times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called the wait for the 30 hour hamburger just got longer 
 because our hamburger recipe our ultimate hamburger recipe if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff it does take about thirty hours  of
 course you 're not actually working the whole time most of the time is kind of sitting there the point of this cutaway is to show
  people a view of hamburgers they haven 't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers because
 believe it or not there is something to the physics and chemistry in particular those flames underneath the burger  
 most of the characteristic  char grilled taste
 doesn 't come from the wood or the charcoal buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing or burning so it 's the
  fat that drips down and flares and flares up that causes the characteristic taste now you might wonder how do we make these cutaways most people assume we use photoshop and the answer is no not really we use a machine shop
  and it turns out the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half  so we have two
  halves of one of the best kitchens in the world we cut a $ five thousand restaurant oven in half
 the manufacturer said what would it take for you to cut one in half i said it would have to show up free 
 and so it showed up we used it a little while we cut it in half  
 now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots we would glue a piece of pyrex or heat resistant glass in front 
  silicon to do that the great thing is when you cut something in half you have another half  
 so you photograph that in exactly the same position  and then you can substitute in and that that part does use photoshop just the edges  
 so it 's very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air supported by wires and then they take the wires away digitally so you 're flying through the air 
 in most cases though there was no glass like for the
  we just cut the damn barbecue  and so those coals that kept falling off the edge we kept having to put them back up but again it only has to work for a thousandth of a second  the
 wok shot caught fire three times what happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh  
 one of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way but hey they grow back 
 in addition to cutaways we also
  this is fourier 's law of heat conduction it 's a partial differential equation  
 we have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it 
 but to make them palatable we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this 
 we 've got lots of little
 tidbits in the book
 everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage right  
 but you probably don 't know that much about james watt  but now you will we put a biography of james watt in
  paragraphs
 to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt and where he got his inspiration it turned out he was hired by a scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey  
 we also did a lot of calculation i personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook here 's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue or other radiant heat
  source  goes as you move away from it so as you move vertically away from this surface the heat falls off as you move side to side it moves off that
 horn shaped region is what we call the sweet spot that 's the place where the heat is even to within ten percent so that 's the place where you really want to cook 
 and it 's got this funny horn shaped thing which
 as far as i know again the first cookbook to ever do this now it may also be the last
  cookbook that ever does it you know there 's two ways you can make a product you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want 
 or you can just kind of go for it
 and make the book you want and hope other people like it 
 here 's a step by step that shows grinding hamburger if you really want great hamburger it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain
  it 's really simple as you can see here as it comes out of the grinder you just have a little tray and you just
 take it off in little passes  build it up slice it vertically here 's the final hamburger 
 this is the 30 hour hamburger we make every aspect of this burger the lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it 
 we also have things about how to make the bun  there 's a mushroom ketchup it goes on and on 
 now watch closely this is popcorn
  here the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics isn
 't that beautiful we have a very  high speed camera  which we had lots of fun with on the book  
 the key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of one thousand six hundred that 's what 's happening to the water inside that popcorn so it 's a
  to close with a video that is kind of unusual we have a chapter on gels  
 and because people watch mythbusters and csi i thought well  let 's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin 
 well  
 if you have a high speed camera  and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around 
 pretty soon somebody does this 
 now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh
  when you get shot that 's why you shouldn 't get shot the other amazing thing is when this ballistics gelatin comes down it falls back down as a nice block anyway here 's the book
  friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen so there 's a sixth volume that has washable waterproof paper
