  shots might start to look familiar 
 this is central park
  one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in america 
 but to anyone who hasn 't visited these images can 't really fully convey 
 to really understand central park you have to physically be there
  well the same is true of the music 
 which my brother and i composed and mapped specifically for central park
 i 'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing
 that 's us there that 's both of us actually specifically about a concept that we 've been developing over the last few years this idea of
  and music producers we 've been working together since well since we were kids really  
 but recently we 've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect 
 from creating sight specific audio and video installation
 to engineering interactive concerts  but today i want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space
  but before i go too much further into that let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea  
 my brother and i were living in new york city when the artists christo and jeanne claude did their temporary installation the gates in central park  
 hundreds of these  brightly colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks 
 and unlike work that 's exhibited in a more neutral space like on the walls of a gallery or a
  museum this was work that was really in dialogue with this place and in a lot of ways the gates
 was really a celebration of frederick olmsted 's incredible design 
 this was an experience that stayed with us for a long time and years later  my brother and i moved back to washington d c and we started to ask the question
  would it be possible in the same way that the gates responded to the physical layout of the park 
 to compose music for a landscape  
 which brought us to this 
 on memorial day  we released the national mall 
  album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device 's
  gps functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of washington 
 hundreds of musical segments are geo tagged throughout the entire park
 so that as a listener traverses the landscape a musical score is actually unfolding around them so this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended
  for the park 
 but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener 's chosen trajectory  
 so think of this as a
  of an album  
 let 's take a closer look let 's look at one example here so using the app as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the washington monument
  you hear the sounds of instruments warming up
 which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody 
 this is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins
 fireworks
 and all sorts of musical craziness 
 as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park 
 but were you to walk in the opposite direction this entire sequence happens in reverse and
  and were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park the music would fade to silence and the play button would disappear  
 we 're sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can 't travel to the united states but would like to hear this record  
 well  unlike a normal album we haven 't been able to accommodate this request when they ask for a c d or an mp3 version 
 we just can 't make that happen 
 and the reason is
 is because this isn 't a promotional app
 or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record 
 in this case the app is the work itself 
 and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience 
 six months later we did a location aware album for central park 
 a park that is over two times the size of the national mall with music spanning from the sheep 's
  meadow to the ramble to the reservoir  
 currently my brother and i are working on projects all over the country  
 but last spring we started a project here actually at stanford 's experimental media art department 
 where we 're creating our largest  location aware album to date one that will span the entirety of highway one here on the
  but what we 're doing  integrating gps with music is really just one idea  
 but it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that 's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age 
 that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model  
 but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with
 and experience music  thank you
