  also one of the co founders of the plastic pollution coalition  
 i 've been working with plastic bags which i cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last twenty years  i turn them into two and three dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations
 upon working with the plastic after about the first eight years some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic 
 and i thought great it 's ephemeral just like us 
 upon educating myself a little further about plastics i actually realized this was a
  's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits because it 's always still plastic 
 and what we 're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment i then in the last few years learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre 
 and my initial reaction and i think this is a lot of people 's first reaction to learning about it is 
 oh my god we 've got to go out there and clean this thing up 
 so i actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two
  decommissioned fishing trawlers a crane 
 a chipping machine and a cold molding machine 
 and my intention was to go out to the gyre raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic  chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in
  i began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment
 and upon doing so
 i realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world  
 and that actually i needed to back up and look at the bigger picture and the bigger picture is we need to find a way
 to turn off the faucet we need to
 cut the spigot of single use and disposable plastics  which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale 
 so in looking at that i also realized that i was really angry  i wasn 't just concerned about plastic that you 're trying to imagine out in the middle of the pacific ocean of which i have learned there are now eleven gyres potentially of
 plastic in five major oceans in the world it
 's not just that gyre of plastic that i 'm concerned about it 's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket 
 i 'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic all of my beverages are packaged in plastic even at the health food market 
 i 'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator  and i 'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies  
 so i came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue and we created the
  pollution coalition 
 we have many initiatives that we 're working on  but some of them are very basic 
 one is 
 if eighty to ninety percent of what we 're finding in the ocean of the marine debris that we 're finding in the ocean is plastic then why don 't we call it what it is it 's plastic pollution 
 recycling
 everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling you put
  in a bin and you don 't have to think about it again 
 what is the reality of that in the united states  less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled and if you really look into it particularly when it comes to plastic bottles  
 most of it is only down cycled or incinerated or shipped to china it is down cycled and turned into lesser things  
 while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or
 can be used again a plastic bottle can never
  be a plastic bottle again 
 so this is a big issue for us  
 another thing that we 're looking at and asking people to think about is we 've added a fourth r onto the front of the reduce reuse recycle three r 's  
  and that is refuse  whenever possible  refuse single use and disposable plastics alternatives exist some of them are very  old school i myself am now collecting these
  cool pyrex containers and using those instead of
 glad and tupperware containers to store food in and i know that i am doing a service to myself and my family it
 's very easy to pick up a stainless steel bottle or a glass bottle if you 're traveling and you 've forgotten to bring your  stainless steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water  versus purchasing
 plastic bottled water  
 i guess what i want to say to everybody here and i know that you guys know a lot about this issue is that this is a huge problem in the oceans  but this is a problem that we 've created as consumers and we can solve 
 we can solve this by raising awareness of the issue
 and teaching people to choose alternatives so whenever possible to choose alternatives to single use plastics we can cut the stem tide the stem of this into our oceans
 and in doing so save our oceans  save our planet save ourselves
