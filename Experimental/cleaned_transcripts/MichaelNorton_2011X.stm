  so i want to talk today about money and happiness which are two things a lot of us spend a lot of our time
 thinking about either trying to earn them or trying to increase them and a lot of us resonate with this phrase we see it in religions and self help books 
 money can 't buy happiness and i want to suggest today
  fact that 's wrong 
 i 'm at a business school so that 's what we do so that that 's wrong  and in fact  if you think that you 're just not spending it right  so instead of spending it the way you usually spend it maybe if you spent it differently that might work a little bit
 better before i tell you the ways you can spend it that will make you happier 
  let 's think about the ways we usually spend it that don 't in fact make us happier  we had a little natural experiment so cnn a little while ago wrote this
 interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery  it turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives will be amazing this article 's about how their lives get ruined
 what happens when people win the lottery is one they spend all the money and go into debt and two all of their friends and everyone they 've ever met
 find them and bug them for money it ruins their social relationships in fact so they have more debt
  and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery what was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article readers of the thing 
 and instead of talking about how it it made them realize that money doesn 't lead to happiness  everyone started saying you know what i 'd do if i won the lottery 
 and fantasizing about what they 'd do here 's just two of the ones we saw that are interesting to think
  when i win i 'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top 
 and another person wrote i would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne 
 this is even worse then i 'd have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture
 and nothing else 
 and so many of the comments were exactly of this type where people got money
  and in fact it made them antisocial  so i told you it ruins people 's lives and their friends bug them also money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves 
 we thought maybe the reason money doesn 't make us happy is that we 're spending it on the wrong things in particular we 're always spending it on ourselves  and we wondered what would happen if we made people spend more of their money
 on others so instead of being antisocial with your money  what if you
 it we thought let 's make people do it and see what happens let 's have some people do what they usually do spend money on themselves and let 's make some people give money away and measure their happiness and see if in fact they get happier 
 the first way we did this was one vancouver morning we went out on the campus
 at university of british columbia approached people and said do you want to be in an experiment they said
  we asked them how happy they were  and then gave them an envelope one of the envelopes had things in it that said by 5pm today spend this money on
 yourself we gave some examples of what you could spend it on other people got a slip of paper that said by 5pm today spend this money on somebody else 
 also inside the envelope was money and we manipulated how much money we gave them some people got this slip of paper and five dollars 
 some got this slip of paper and twenty dollars  
 we let them go about their day
  whatever they wanted we found out they did spend it in the way we asked them to we called them up and asked them what did you spend it on how happy do you feel now 
 what did they spend it on these are college undergrads a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup one woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece 
 people gave money to homeless people huge effect here of
  if you give undergraduates five dollars it looks like coffee to them and they run over to starbucks and spend it as fast as they can
 some people bought coffee for themselves the way they usually would but  others bought coffee for somebody else so the very same purchase just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward
  somebody else  what did we find when we called at the end of the day people who spent money on others got happier people who spent
  didn 't make them less happy it just didn 't do much for them the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn 't matter much people thought twenty dollars would be way better than five in fact  
  it doesn 't matter how much money you spent what really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself we see this again and again when we give people money
  we wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries so we went to uganda
 and ran a very similar experiment imagine instead of just people in canada we say name the last time you spent money on yourself or others describe it how happy did it make you or in uganda name the last time you spent money on yourself or others
 and describe that then we asked them how happy they
  and what we see is sort of amazing because there 's human universals on what you do with your money and real cultural differences on what you do as well so for example  one guy from uganda says this 
 i called a girl i wished to love they basically went out on a date and he says at the end that he didn 't achieve her up till now 
  we went to a movie we left early  and then went back to her room for cake just cake 
 human universal you spend money on others you 're being nice  maybe you have something in mind maybe not but then we see extraordinary differences so look at these two this is a woman from canada  we say 
 name a time you spent money on somebody else she says 
 i bought a present for my mom i drove to the mall bought a present gave it to my mom perfectly nice thing to do it 's good to get gifts for people you know compare that to this woman from
  uganda i was walking and met a longtime friend whose whose son was sick with malaria they had no money they went to a clinic
 and i gave her this money this isn 't $ ten thousand it 's the local currency  so it 's a very small amount of money in fact but
 enormously different motivations here this is a real medical need literally a lifesaving donation  above it 's just kind of i bought a gift for my mother 
 what we see again though is that the specific way you spend on other people
 isn 't nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy which is really quite important so you don 't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy 
 you can do small trivial things and still get the benefits from doing this these are only two countries we wanted to look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between
  we got data from the gallup organization which you know from all the political polls happening lately they asked people did you donate money to charity recently and how happy are you with life in general 
 we can see what the relationship is between those two things are they positively correlated giving money makes you happy or are they negatively correlated on this map green will mean they 're positively correlated red means 
 they 're negatively correlated and you can see the world is crazily green so in almost every country in the world where we have this data people who give
  money to charity are happier people than people who don 't give money to charity i know you 're looking at the red country in the middle 
 i would be a jerk and not tell you what it is but  it 's central african republic you can make up stories maybe it 's different there for some reason just below that to the right is rwanda though which is amazingly green 
 so almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier
  than keeping it
 for yourself  
 what about work which is where we spend the rest of our time when we 're not with the people we know  we decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing these are sales teams
 in belgium they work in teams go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs we can look and see how well they sell things
 as a function of being a member of a team
 we give people on some teams some money spend it however you want on yourself just like we did with the undergrads in canada  to other teams we say here 's fifteen euro
 spend it on one of your teammates buy them something as a gift and give it to them then we can see we 've got teams that spend on themselves and these pro social teams who we give money to 
 make the team better the reason i have a ridiculous pinata there is one team pooled their money and bought a pinata  they smashed the pinata the candy fell out and things like that a silly trivial thing to do but think of the difference on a team that didn 't do that at all that got fifteen euro
  it in their pocket maybe bought themselves a coffee or teams that had this pro social experience where they bonded together to buy something and do a group activity what we see is that the teams that are pro social sell 
  more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves one way to think of it is for every fifteen euro you give people for themselves  they put it in their pocket and don 't do anything different than before you don 't get money from that you lose money since it doesn 't motivate them to perform
  when you give them fifteen euro to spend on their teammates they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money
 you 're probably thinking to yourselves this is all fine but there 's a context that 's incredibly important for public policy 
 and i can 't imagine it would work there and if he doesn 't show me that it works here i don 't believe anything he said
  got that if you can 't show it with dodgeball teams this is all stupid so we we went and
 found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them and did the exact same thing as before so we give people on some teams money to spend on themselves other teams we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates  
 the teams that spend money on themselves have the same winning percentages as before the teams we give the money to spend on each other become different teams
  league by the time they 're done  across all of these different contexts your personal life you work life even things like intramural sports we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending
 on yourself
  if you think money can 't buy happiness you 're not spending it right the implication isn 't you should buy this product instead of that product and
  that 's the way to make yourself happier it 's that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself 
 and try giving some of it to other people instead and we luckily have an opportunity for you
 donorschoose org is a nonprofit for mainly public school teachers in low income schools they post projects like i want to teach huckleberry finn and we don 't have the books 
 or i want a microscope to teach my students science and we don 't have a microscope you and i can go on and buy it for them 
 pictures of them using the microscope  it 's an extraordinary thing go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking less about 
 how can i spend money on myself and more about if i 've got five dollars or fifteen dollars what can i do to benefit other people ultimately when you do that you 'll find you benefit yourself much more thank you
