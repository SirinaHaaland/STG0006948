  i was born with
 with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia which is total color blindness  
 so i 've never seen color and i don 't know what color looks like 
 because i come from a grayscale world to me the sky is always gray
  flowers are always gray and television is still in black and white  but since the age of 
 instead of seeing color i can hear color 
 in two thousand and three i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon  and
 the result with further collaborations with
  from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona is this
 electronic eye  it 's a color sensor that detects
 the color frequency in front of me 
 and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head  and i hear the color in front of me through the bone through bone conduction
  i 've been hearing color all the time for eight
  since two thousand and four  so i find it completely normal now to hear color all the time
  at the start though i had to memorize the the names you give for each color so i had to memorize the notes  but after some time all this information became a perception 
 i didn 't have to think about the notes  and after some time this perception became a feeling i started to have favorite colors and i started to dream in colors so
  when i started to dream in color is when i felt that the software and my brain had united because in my dreams  it was my brain creating electronic sounds it wasn 't the software so
 that 's when i started to feel like a cyborg it 's when i started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device it had become a part of my body  an extension of my
  and after some time  it even became a part of my official image
  this is my passport from two thousand and four you 're not allowed to appear on u k passports with electronic equipment  but i insisted to the passport office that 
 what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body  an extension of my brain and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport
  life has changed dramatically since i hear color  because
 color is almost everywhere so the biggest change for example is
 going to an art gallery  i can listen
 to a picasso for example so it 's like i 'm
 going to a concert hall because i can listen to the paintings and supermarkets i find this is very shocking it 's very very attractive to walk along a supermarket it 's like going to a nightclub it 's full of different
 melodies
  especially the aisle with cleaning products it 's just fabulous 
 laughter also the way i dress has changed before i used to dress in a way that it looked good now i dress in a way that it sounds good 
 so today i 'm dressed in c major  so it 's quite a happy chord
 if i had to go to a funeral though i would dress in b minor which would be
 turquoise  purple and orange 
 laughter also food 
 the way i look at food has changed  because now i can display the food on a plate  so i can eat my favorite song so depending on how i
  display it i can hear and i can compose music with food so imagine a restaurant where we can have like  lady gaga salads as starters i mean 
 this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables probably  
 and also some rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes  and some bjork or madonna desserts that would be a very exciting
 restaurant where you can actually eat songs
  also the way i perceive beauty has changed because
 when i look at someone i hear their face so
 someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible and it might happen the opposite  
 the other way around so i really enjoy creating like sound portraits of people instead of drawing someone 's
 face like drawing the shape i point at them with the eye
  and i write down the different notes i hear and then i create sound portraits here 's some faces
  never relate but they sound similar  prince charles has some similarities with nicole kidman they have similar sound of eyes so you relate people that you wouldn 't relate  
 and you can actually also create
 concerts
 by looking at the audience faces so i connect the eye and then i play the audience 's faces the good thing about this is if the concert doesn 't sound good  it 's their fault  it 's not my fault
 so another
 thing that happens is that i started having this secondary effect
 that normal sounds started to become color  i heard a
 telephone tone  and it it felt green because it sounded just like the color green the bbc beeps 
 they sound turquoise  and listening to mozart became a yellow experience  so i started to
  paint music and paint people 's voices because people 's voices have frequencies that i relate to color  and here 's some
 music translated into into color for example  mozart queen
 of the night looks like this very yellow and very colorful because there 's many different frequencies
  very pink and very yellow so also voices i can transform
 speeches into into color  for example  these are two very
  one of them is martin luther king 's i have a dream and the other one is hitler and i like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels 
  and then i ask people which one do you prefer and most people change their preference when i tell them that the one on the left is hitler
  vision i was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel but then i just
 thought that this human vision wasn wasn 't good enough there 's many many more colors around us that we cannot perceive  but that electronic eyes can perceive so 
 i decided to continue extending my color senses  and i added
 hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive for example perceiving infrared is good because you can actually
 detect if there 's movement detectors in a room i can hear if someone points at me with a remote control  and
 the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it 's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe  because ultraviolet is a dangerous color
  color that can actually kill us so i think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we we cannot perceive that 's why two years ago  i created the cyborg foundation which is a foundation that
 tries to help people become a cyborg  tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body  we should all think that knowledge comes from
 our senses so if we extend our senses
 we will consequently extend our knowledge 
 i think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body i think this will 
  be a big big change that we will see during this century  so i do encourage you all to think about
  senses you 'd like to extend  i would encourage you to become a cyborg you won 't be alone thank
