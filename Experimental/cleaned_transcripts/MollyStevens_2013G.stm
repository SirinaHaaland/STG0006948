  as humans it 's in our nature to want to improve our health and minimize our suffering  
 whatever life throws at us whether it 's cancer diabetes heart disease or even broken bones we want to try and get better 
 now i 'm head of a biomaterials lab and i 'm really fascinated by the way that
  humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body
 over time  take for example  this beautiful blue nacre shell this was actually used by the mayans as an artificial
 tooth replacement 
 we 're not quite sure why they did it it 's hard it 's durable  but it also had other very nice properties 
 in fact when they put it into the jawbone
  could integrate into the jaw  
 and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way has a beautiful chemistry has a beautiful architecture  
 and i think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology
 but
 if we if we move on and think throughout history how people have
 used different materials in the body  very often it 's been physicians that have been quite creative they 've taken things off the shelf  one of my favorite examples
 is that of
 sir harold ridley who was a famous
  at least became a famous ophthalmologist 
 and during world war ii what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye  
 but the very interesting thing about it was that material actually wasn 't causing any inflammatory response  
 so he looked into this and he figured out that actually that material was little shards of plastic that were coming from the canopy of the spitfires  
 and this led him to propose that material
 as a new material for intraocular lenses it 's called pmma and it 's now used in millions of people every year and helps in preventing cataracts  
 and that example i think is a really nice one because it helps remind us that in the early days people often chose materials because they were  bioinert their very purpose 
  was to perform a mechanical function you 'd put them in the body and you wouldn 't get an adverse response
 and what i want to show you is that in regenerative medicine we 've really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material we 're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive 
 that will interact with the body and that furthermore we can put in the body they 'll have their function  and then they 'll dissolve away over time
  if we look at this schematic this is showing you what we think of as the typical tissue engineering approach  we have cells there  typically from the patient we can put those onto a material 
 and we can make that material very complex if we want to and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient  and this is an approach that 's used all over the world  including in our lab  
  cells can be many different things and they want to be many different things and so we want to make sure that the environment we put them into has enough information so that they can become the right sort of specialist tissue  
 and if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world in all the different labs in the world there 's pretty much every tissue you can think of 
 and actually the structure of those tissues is quite different
 and it 's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease other conditions 
 in terms of how you 're going to regenerate your tissue and you 're going to need to think about the materials you 're going to use really carefully  their biochemistry their mechanics and many other properties as well 
 our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate and here we see poor prometheus  who made a rather
  tricky career choice
 and was punished by the greek gods 
 he was tied to a rock  and an eagle would come every day to eat his liver but of course his liver would regenerate every day  and so day after day he was punished
 for eternity by by the gods  and
 liver will regenerate in this very nice way but actually if we think of other tissues like cartilage
  example even the simplest nick and you 're going to find it really difficult to regenerate your cartilage  so it 's going to be very different from tissue to tissue 
 now bone is somewhere in in between and this is one of the tissues that we work on a lot in our lab  and bone is actually quite good at repairing it has to be we 've probably all had fractures at some point or other 
 and one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here
  called an  iliac crest harvest  and what the surgeon might do is is take some bone from
 your iliac crest which is just here  
 and then transplant that somewhere else in the body and it actually works really well because it 's your own bone and it 's well vascularized which means it 's got a really good blood supply  
 but the problem is there 's only so much you can take
  and also
 when you do that operation your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two years after the operation  
 so what we were thinking is there 's a tremendous need
 for bone repair of course but this
  really has a lot of limitations to it and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these
 very very painful
  aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest  
 and so this is what we did  and the way we did it was by coming back to this typical tissue engineering approach but actually thinking about it rather differently  
 and we simplified it a lot so we got rid of a lot of these steps we got rid of the need to harvest cells from the patient  we got rid of the need to put in really fancy chemistries  and we got rid of the need to culture these
  scaffolds in the lab  
 and what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple
 but because we used it in a really clever way we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone using this approach  so we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone
  and it 's an approach that we call the in vivo bioreactor and we were able to make enormous amounts of bone using this approach  and i 'll talk you through this so what we do
 is in humans we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones that layer is called the periosteum and that layer is actually normally
 very very tightly bound to the underlying bone  and it 's got stem cells in it those stem cells are really important in the embryo when it develops  and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you
  repairing the bone  
 so we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then within thirty seconds would turn into quite a rigid gel 
 and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone  so it creates in essence an artificial cavity
  cells  and we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in 
 and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells and they can form lots of new tissue 
 and then over time you can harvest that tissue and use it elsewhere in the body  
 essentially what we see is is very large amounts of bone so in this picture you can see the middle of the leg so the bone marrow then you can see the original bone and you can see where that original bone finishes 
 and just to the left of that is the new bone that 's grown within that bioreactor cavity and you can actually make it even larger  
 and that demarcation that you can see between the original bone and the new bone acts
  as a very slight point of weakness  so actually now the surgeon can come along can harvest away that new bone and the periosteum can grow back  so you 're left with the leg
 in the same sort of state as if you hadn 't operated on it in the first place so it 's very very low in terms of
 compared to an iliac crest harvest
  and you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there so it really is an on demand sort of procedure 
 now at the time that we did this this received a lot of
 attention in the press because it was a really nice way of generating new bone and we got many many contacts
 from different people that were interested in using this and i 'm just going to tell you sometimes
  most interesting let me put it that way contact that i had was actually from a team of american footballers that all wanted to have double thickness skulls made
 on on their
 head  and so you you do get these kinds of contacts and of course being british and also growing up in france i tend to be very
 blunt  and so
  i had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case there probably wasn 't that much in there to protect in the first place 
 applause so this was our approach and it was simple materials but we thought about it carefully  and actually we know that those cells in the in the body in the embryo as they develop
  can form
 a different kind of tissue cartilage  
 and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry put it in there  and we were able to get one hundred percent cartilage instead  
 and this approach works really well i think for pre planned procedures
  but it 's something you do have to pre plan so for other kinds of operations 
 there 's definitely a need for other scaffold based approaches 
 and when you think about designing those other scaffolds
  actually you need a really  multi disciplinary team  and so our team has chemists it has cell biologists surgeons 
 physicists even and those people all come together and we think really hard about designing the materials but we want to make them
 have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want but not be so complex as to make it difficult to
  and so one of the things we think about a lot is is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body  and so if we think of bone  obviously
 my own favorite tissue 
 we zoom in we can see even if you don 't know anything about bone structure it 's beautifully organized really beautifully organized we 've lots of blood vessels in there  and if we zoom in again we see that the cells are actually surrounded by a 3d
  and they give a lot of information to the cells 
 and if we zoom in again actually in the case of bone the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale and it 's a hybrid material that 's part organic part inorganic  
 and that 's led to a whole field really that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid
 kind of structure  and so i 'm showing here just two examples where we 've made some materials that have that sort of structure
  and you can really tailor it you can see here a very squishy one
 and now a material that 's also this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness and it 's no longer brittle  and an inorganic material would normally be really brittle 
  and you wouldn 't be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it one other thing i want to quickly mention is that many of the scaffolds we make are porous and they have to be because you want blood vessels to grow in there  
  are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells and so even though it 's 3d the cell might see it more as a slightly curved surface and that 's a little bit unnatural  
 and so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in 3d and give them a little bit more information and there 's a lot of work going on in both of these areas 
 now finally i just want
  to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease because this is a really big clinical problem and
 one of the things that we know is that unfortunately if you have a heart attack then that tissue can start
 to die  and your outcome may not be very good
  and it would be really great actually if we could stop that dead tissue either from dying or help it to regenerate  
 and there 's lots and lots of stem cell trials going on worldwide and they use many different types of cells but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually very often those cells will die once you 've implanted them 
 and you can either put them into the heart or into the
 blood system but either way we don 't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to
  the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of
 beautiful cell regeneration that we would like
 to have to get good good clinical outcomes  and so some of the things that we 're thinking of and many other people
 in the field are thinking of are actually developing materials for that but there 's a difference here we still need chemistry we still need mechanics we still need
  really interesting topography and we still need really interesting ways to surround the cells 
 but now the cells also would probably quite like a material that 's going to be able to be conductive  because
 the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals between themselves you can see them now
  on these materials and that 's a very very exciting
 development that 's going on so just to wrap up i 'd like to actually say that
 being able to work in this this sort of field all of us that work in this field that 's
 not only super exciting science but also has the potential
 to impact on patients however big or small they are is really a great privilege and so for that i 'd like to thank all
