  like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before
 what is possible with the human
  the human voice but
  it was coming straight for me i had to it was yeah as you can probably
 well imagine i was a strange child laughter
 because the thing is i was i was constantly trying to
 extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be i was
 constantly experimenting with these noises and i 'm still on that mission i 'm still trying to find every noise that i can possibly make
 and the thing is i 'm a bit older and wiser now and i know that there 's some noises i 'll never be able to make because i 'm hemmed in by
 my physical body and there 's things it can 't do and there 's things that no one 's voice can do for example no one can do two notes at the same time you can do two tone
  's cheating
 and it hurts your throat so there 's things you can 't do and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me
  beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world but they 're sketches at best which is which is what 's annoyed me if only if only there was a way for these ideas to come out
 unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it
 so i 've been working with these guys and we 've made a machine we 've made a system which is basically a live
  production machine a real time music production machine and it enables me to using nothing but my voice
 create music in real time as i hear it in my head
 unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me and
 i 'm going to show you what it can do and before i start making
  noises with it
 and using it to manipulate my voice i want to reiterate that everything that you 're about to hear is being made by
 my voice this
 this system has thank you beautiful assistant
 this this system has no sounds in it itself until i start putting sounds in it so there 's no prerecorded samples of any
  kind
 so once this thing really gets going and it really starts to mangle the audio i 'm putting into it it becomes
 not obvious that it is the human voice but it is so i 'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple
 so the polyphony problem i 've only got one voice how do i get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time the simplest way to do it is something like this
 by dancing it
  's probably the easiest way but if you want to do something a little bit more immediate something
  you can 't achieve with live looping there 's other ways to layer your voice up there 's things like pitch shifting
 which are awesome and i 'm going to show you now what that sounds like so i 'm going to start another beat for you like this beatboxing
 there 's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start because it 's just fun so you can clap along if you
  's fine check it out i 'm going to lay down a bass sound now music
  which is nice but what if i want to make say a applause thanks what if i want to make say a rock organ is that possible yes
 it is by recording myself like this organ sound and now i have that
 i have that recorded
 assign it to a keyboard music
 so that 's cool applause but
 what if i wanted to sound like the whole of pink floyd impossible you say no
 it is possible
  and you can do it very simply using this machine it 's really fantastic check it out
  every noise you can hear there is my voice i didn 't just trigger something which
 sounds like that there 's no samples there 's no synthesizers that is literally all my
  voice being manipulated and when you get to that point you have to ask don 't you
 what 's the point why
 why do this laughter because it 's cheaper than hiring the whole of pink floyd i suppose is the easy answer but
 in actual fact i haven 't made this machine so that i can emulate things that already exist
 i 've made this so that i can make any noise that i can imagine so with your permission i 'm going to do
 things that are in my mind and i hope you enjoy them
 because they 're rather unusual
 especially when you 're doing things which are as unusual as this it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice you see
  loosely defined that is what 's possible with the human voice
  much ladies
 and
