  when i was a young officer they told me to follow my instincts to go with my gut and what i 've learned
 is that often our instincts are wrong 
 in the summer of two thousand and ten there was a massive
  leak of classified documents that came out of the pentagon  
 it shocked the world  it shook up the american government and it made people ask a lot of questions because
 the sheer amount of information that was let out and the potential impacts were significant
 and one of the first questions we asked ourselves was why would a young
  soldier have access to that much information why would we let sensitive things
 be with a relatively young person 
 in the summer of two thousand and three i was assigned to command a special operations task force  
 and that task force was spread across the mideast to fight al qaeda our main effort was inside iraq  
 and our specified mission
 was to defeat al qaeda in iraq for almost five years i stayed there  and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional
 and it was difficult and it was bloody
 and it often claimed its highest price
 among innocent people we did everything we could to stop al qaeda
 and the
  foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers and as
 accelerants to the violence 
 we honed our combat skills  we developed new equipment  
 we parachuted we helicoptered  we took small boats we drove and we walked to objectives night after night to to stop the killing that this network was putting forward
  we bled  we died  and we killed to stop that organization
 from the violence that they were putting largely against the iraqi people 
 now we did what we knew  
 how we had grown up and one of the things that we knew that was in our dna was secrecy it was security
  it was protecting information it was the idea that information was the lifeblood and it was what would protect and keep people safe  
 and we had a sense that 
 as we operated within our organizations it was important to keep information in the silos within the organizations particularly
 only give information to people had a demonstrated need to know but the question often came
 who needed to know 
 who needed 
 who had to have the information so that they could do the important parts of the job that you needed and in a tightly coupled world 
 that 's very hard to predict 
 it 's very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn 't i used to deal with intelligence
  if i knew that we wouldn 't have a problem 
 but what we found is we had to change we had to change our culture about information we had to knock down walls we had to share  we had to change from who needs to know
 to the fact that who doesn 't know and we need to tell and tell them as quickly as we can it was a significant culture shift for an organization
  that had secrecy in its dna  
 we started by doing things by building not working in offices  knocking down walls working in things we called situation awareness rooms  
 and in the summer of two thousand and seven something happened which demonstrated this we captured the personnel records
 for the people who were bringing foreign fighters into iraq  and when we got the
  personnel records typically we would have hidden these shared them with a few intelligence agencies and then try to operate with them  but as i was talking to my intelligence officer i said what do we do
  but as we passed that information around suddenly you find that information is only of value if you give it to people who have the ability to do something with it 
 the fact that i know something has zero value if i 'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it so as a consequence what we did was we changed the idea
 of information instead of knowledge is power to one where sharing is power  it was the
  fundamental shift not new tactics not new weapons not new anything else it was the idea that we were now part of a team in which information became the essential link between us not a block between us  
 and i want everybody to take a deep breath and let it out  because in your
  there 's going to be information that leaks out you 're not going to like  somebody 's going to get my college grades out a that 's going to be a disaster 
 but it 's going to be okay  and i will tell you that
 i am more scared
 of the bureaucrat that holds information in a desk drawer or in a safe than i am of someone who leaks because ultimately we 'll be better off if we share  thank
  i don 't know if you were here this morning if you were able to catch rick ledgett the deputy director of the nsa who was responding to edward snowden 's
 talk earlier this week i just wonder do you think the american government should give edward snowden amnesty
