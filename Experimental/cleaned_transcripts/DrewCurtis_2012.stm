  by a company called gooseberry natural resources
  owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email 
 now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented but it does happen all the time  take something already being done
 and patent it for an emerging technology like phone calls on the internet
 or video listings for tv shows or radio but for cellphones  and so on the
  problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional  and as a result most of these lawsuits end in settlements 
 and because these settlements are under a non disclosure agreement no one knows what the terms were  and as a result the patent troll can claim that they won the case 
 in the case of gooseberry natural
  this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself  
 and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release  and it turns out that is press release as in p r 
 now my company fark  deals with news ostensibly  
 and as a result we were not in violation of this patent so case closed right
  one of the major problems with patent law is that in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant  
 which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they 're suing you on and this can take quite a while 
 you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes eighteen months when you win 
 that is your best case
  outcome when you get sued by a patent troll  
 now i had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit but one by one they settled out of the case  
 even though and this is important none of these companies infringed on this patent not a one of them 
 and they started settling out 
 the reason they settled out is because it 's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit clearly two million
  dollars cheaper in some cases and much worse if you actually lose  it would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company especially a small eight man shop like my company  
 six months into the lawsuit we finally reached the discovery phase  and in discovery phase we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring  
 now perhaps it 's because no
  such screenshots actually existed  but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle their attorney 
 ah yes  my company 's having a reorganization on our end never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l a with no employees 
 and we 'd like to go ahead and close this out so would you mind
  we didn 't have high hopes for that outcome 
 but they settled no counter offer  
 now as mentioned before one of the reasons i can talk to you about this is because there 's no non disclosure agreement on this case now how did that happen 
 well during the settlement process when we received our copy
  i struck it my attorney said nah no chance of that working it came back signed  
 now why you can call them they 're not under nda either 
 now what did i learn from this case  well three things  
 first of all if you can don 't fight the patent fight the infringement 
 patents are very difficult to overturn infringement is a lot easier to disprove
  make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money  
 now the reason this works
 is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they 're able to recover in settlements 
 if it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money they become less interested in pursuing the case  
 finally make sure that you can tell them
  that you will make this process as annoying and as painful and as difficult as possible for them  
 now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way it turns out because they 're paid on contingency it works really really well in reverse don 't forget that 
 so what does all this mean well to sum up it boils down to one thing  don 't negotiate with terrorists
 patent trolls have done more damage to the united states economy than any domestic 
 or foreign terrorist organization in history every year  
 plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits  now this is the point in the talk where i 'm supposed to
 come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system and the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have
 different outcomes in mind for the patent system  
 the health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors the hi tech industry would like stronger protections for producers  
 and these goals aren 't necessarily diametrically opposed but they are at odds  and as a result patent trolls can kind of
  live in the space in between so unfortunately i 'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem however i did have this idea  
 and it was kind of good  and i thought i should patent this 
 behold patent infringement via mobile device defined as a computer which is not stationary
  my solution award me this patent and i will troll them out of existence  thank you
