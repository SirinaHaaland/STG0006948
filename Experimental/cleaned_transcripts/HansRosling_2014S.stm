  going to ask you three multiple choice questions use this device 
 use this device to answer the first question is how did the number of deaths per year from natural
  how did that change during the last century did it more than double  did it remain about the same in the world as a whole or did it decrease to less than half   please 
  answer a b or  c i see lots of answers this is much faster than i do it at universities they are so slow  they keep thinking thinking thinking  oh very very good and we go to the next question  
  or three years a b or c  please answer 
 and we go to the next question 
 in the last twenty years how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change extreme poverty not having enough food for the day  did it almost double  did it remain more or less the same or did it halve
  a b or c  
 now answers
  you see deaths from natural disasters in the world you can see it from this graph here from one thousand nine hundred to two thousand 
 in one thousand nine hundred there was about half a million people who died every year from natural
  gapminder asked the public in sweden  this is how they answered
  the swedish public answered like this  fifty percent thought it had doubled thirty eight percent said it 's more or less the same twelve said it had halved this is the best data from the disaster researchers
  and
 it goes up and down  and it goes to to the second world war
  that it starts to fall and it keeps falling and it 's down to much less than half the world has been much much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this you know 
 so only twelve percent of the swedes know this  so i went to the zoo and i asked the chimps
  the chimps don 't watch the evening news  so the chimps 
 they choose by random so the swedes answer worse than random now how did you do  that 's you 
 you were beaten
  better than the swedes  but that 's not enough you shouldn 't compare yourself to swedes you must have
 higher ambitions in the world  
 let 's look at the next answer here women in school
  here you can see men went eight years how long did women go to school well we asked the swedes like this  
 and that gives you a hint
  right answer is probably the one the fewest swedes picked
  i think it 's like this  that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties they are stopped when they go to school
  and it 's disgusting  but in the majority of the
  where most people in the world live most countries girls today go to school as long as boys more or less
  that doesn 't mean that gender equity is achieved not at all 
 they still
 still are confined to terrible terrible limitations  but schooling is there in the world today now 
 we miss the majority when you answer you answer according to the
  and there you are right but you miss the majority  what about poverty well it 's very clear that poverty here was almost halved  
 and in u s when we asked the public only five percent got it right  
 and you ah
 you almost made it to the chimps
  and many in the rich countries  they think that oh  we can never end extreme poverty  of course they think so because they don 't even know what has happened 
 the first thing to think about the future is to know about the present these questions were
  a few of the first ones in the pilot phase of the ignorance project in gapminder foundation that we run  and
 it was started this project last year by my boss  and also my son  ola rosling he
 's cofounder and director and he wanted ola told me we have to be more systematic when we fight devastating ignorance so already the pilots reveal this
  that so many in the public score worse than random  so we have to think about preconceived ideas  and one of the main preconceived ideas is about world income distribution look here  this is how it was in one thousand nine 
 it 's the number of people on each income from one dollar a day see 
 there was one hump here around one dollar a day  and then there was one hump here somewhere between ten and one hundred dollars the world was two
  groups it was a camel world like a camel with two humps 
 the poor ones and the rich ones and there were fewer in between but look how this has changed as i go forward what has changed the world population has grown  and the humps start to merge  
 the lower humps merged with the upper hump  and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world
 with one hump only
  in poverty has decreased still it 's appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty  we still have this group almost a billion over there  but that can be ended now 
 the challenge we have now  is to get away from that understand where the majority is and that is very clearly shown
  we asked what is the percentage of the world 's one year old children who have got those basic vaccines against measles and other things that we have had for many years 
 twenty fifty or eighty percent now  this is what the u s public and the swedish answered 
 look at the swedish result you know what the right answer is 
 who the heck is a professor of global health in that country
  to really measure what we know made headlines and cnn published these results on their web and they had the questions there millions answered  and i think there were about two 
  thousand comments  and this was one of the comments i bet no member of the media passed the test
  so ola told me take these devices you are invited to media conferences  give it to them and measure what the media know and ladies and gentlemen 
 for the first time  the informal results from a conference with u s media  
 and then lately from the european union media you see
 the problem is not that people don 't read and
  to the media  the problem is that the media doesn 't know themselves what shall we do about
  chimps  
 fortunately i will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault actually then
 i will equip you with some tricks for beating the chimps in the future  
 that 's basically what i will do  but first let 's look at why are we so ignorant and it all starts in this place 
  it 's a city in northern sweden  it 's a neighborhood
 where i grew up 
 and it 's a a neighborhood with a large problem  actually it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods
 where you grew up as well  
 it was not representative  okay  it gave me a very biased view of how life is on this planet so this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle we have a personal bias  we have all different
  experiences from communities and people we meet 
 and on top of this we start school and we add the next problem  well i like schools but teachers tend to
 teach outdated worldviews  because they learned something when they went to school and now they describe this world to the students without any bad
  and those books of course that are printed are outdated in a world that changes  and there is really no practice to keep the
 teaching material up to date so that 's what we are focusing on so we have these outdated facts added on top of our personal bias what happens next is news okay
 an excellent journalist knows how to pick the story that will make headlines and people will read it because it 's sensational 
 unusual events are more interesting
 no and they are exaggerated and especially things we 're afraid of a
 shark attack on a swedish person will get headlines for weeks in sweden
   so these three skewed sources of information were really hard to get away from
 they kind of bombard us and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas
  and on top of it we put the very thing that makes us humans 
 our human intuition  it was good in evolution it helped us generalize and jump to conclusions very very
 fast it
 helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of and we seek causality where there
  we then get an illusion
 of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers  above the average everybody answered that question yeah i drive cars better 
 okay  this was good evolutionarily but now when it comes to the worldview it is the exact reason why it 's upside down the trends that are increasing are instead falling and the other way around and in this
  the chimps use our intuition against us and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength it was supposed to be our strength  wasn 't it 
 so how do we solve such problems first  we need to measure it  and then we need to cure it  so by measuring it we can understand
 what is the pattern of ignorance we started the pilot last year and now we 're pretty sure that we will encounter a lot of ignorance across the whole world 
 and
 the idea is really to
 scale it up to all domains or dimensions of global
 development such as climate endangered species human rights gender equality  energy  finance all different sectors have facts 
  and there are organizations trying to spread awareness about these facts  so i
 i 've started actually contacting some of them like wwf and amnesty international and unicef  and asking them what are your favorite facts which you think the public doesn
  't know okay i gather those facts imagine a long list with say two hundred and fifty facts  
 we turn it into a knowledge certificate a global knowledge certificate  
 which you can use if you 're a large organization a school a university or maybe a news agency 
 to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable
  basically meaning we don 't hire people who score like
  maybe ten years from now if this project succeeds  you will be sitting in an interview having to fill out this crazy
 global knowledge  so
 now we come to the practical tricks how are you going to succeed   there is of course 
 one way which is to sit down late nights and learn all the facts by heart
 by reading all these reports that will never
  happen actually not even hans thinks that 's going to happen people don 't have that time people like shortcuts and here are the shortcuts  
 we need to turn our intuition into strength again we need to be able to generalize  so now i 'm going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around
 into rules of thumb  let 's start with the first misconception this is very widespread everything is
  getting worse  
 you heard it you thought it yourself  the other way to think is most things improve   so you 're sitting with a question in front of you and you 're unsure  you should guess improve okay  don 't go for the worse 
 that will help you score better on our tests
  poor and the gap is increasing  it 's a terrible inequality yeah it 's an unequal world but when you look at the data  it 's one hump  okay  if you feel unsure go 
  for the most people are in the middle  that 's going to help you get the answer right  now the next preconceived idea is
  school and be ready for natural disasters no no no that 's wrong look that huge hump in the middle already have girls in school  so if you are unsure 
 go for the the majority already have this like electricity and girls in school these kinds of things  they 're only rules of thumb so of course they don 't apply to everything but
  but they are not so important in the global statistics that is what i 'm saying  i actually  i 'm very afraid of sharks so as soon as i see a question about things i 'm afraid of which might be 
 earthquakes other religions maybe i 'm afraid of terrorists or sharks anything that makes me feel
  going to exaggerate the problem  that 's a rule of thumb  of course there are dangerous things that are also great 
 sharks kill very very few  that 's how you should think with these four
 rules of thumb  you could probably answer better than the chimps because the chimps cannot do this  they cannot generalize these kinds of
  we can turn your world around and we 're going to beat the chimps  okay 
 that 's a systematic approach now the question is this important 
 yeah it
 's important to understand poverty  extreme poverty
  and how to to fight
 it and how to bring girls in school when we realize that actually it 's succeeding we can understand it but is it important for everyone else who cares about the rich end of this scale  i would say yes  extremely important for the same reason  
 if you have a fact based worldview of today  you might have a chance to understand what 's coming next in the future we 're going back to these two humps in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five that 's when i was born 
 and i
 selected the west
  that 's the current eu countries and north america  
 let 's now see how the rest and the west compares in terms of how rich you are these are the people who can afford to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation 
 in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five only thirty percent of them lived outside eu and north
  but this has changed okay  so first let 's look at the change up till today two thousand and fourteen 
 today it 's fifty fifty  the western domination is over as of today  
 that 's nice so what 's going to happen next do you see the big hump did you see how it moved  
 i did a little experiment i went to the imf  international monetary fund website  they have a forecast for the next five years of gdp per capita  
 so i can use that
  to go five years into the future  assuming the income inequality of each country is the same  i did that but i went even further i used those five years for the next twenty 
  years with the same speed just as an experiment what might actually happen  
  in the rich consumer market these are just projections of gdp per capita into the future seventy three percent of the rich consumers are going to live outside north 
  america and europe so yes i think it 's a good idea for a company to use this certificate to make sure to make fact based decisions in
  the future  thank you very much
