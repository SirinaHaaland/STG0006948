  i 'm a filmmaker for the last eight years i have dedicated my life
 to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful
  when i travel with my work across europe and the united states one question always comes up 
 where is the palestinian gandhi  why aren 't palestinians using nonviolent resistance 
 the challenge i face when i hear this question
 is that often i have just returned from the middle east where i spent my time filming dozens of palestinians who are using nonviolence
  to defend their lands and water resources from israeli soldiers and settlers these leaders are trying to forge
 a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region 
 yet most of you have probably never heard about them 
 this divide between what 's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad
 is one of the key reasons why we don 't have yet a palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful  
 so i 'm here today to talk about the power of attention the power of your attention 
 and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank  gaza and elsewhere but today
  case study is going to be palestine 
 i believe that what 's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence 
 but for us to start paying attention
 to those who already are allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called budrus
 about seven years ago  they faced extinction  because israel announced it would build a separation barrier and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village 
 they would lose forty percent of their land and be surrounded  so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank  
 through inspired local
  they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening 
 let me show you some brief clips so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground
  created a solution to terror
  when i first heard about the story of budrus 
 i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened
 seven years ago in two thousand and three what was even more surprising was the fact that budrus was successful
 the residents
  months of peaceful resistance convinced the israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line  which is the internationally 
  recognized boundary between israel and the palestinian territories  
  yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories 
 this silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow or even survive in palestine 
 violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common
 they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause 
 if violent actors are the only ones constantly getting 
 and attracting international attention to the palestinian issue it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option
 in addressing their plight  
 the power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room  
 the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums
 is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit  
 the tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior
  since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it 
 parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children  
 but that 's true for adults too 
 in fact the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced depending on where the international
  community chooses
 to focus its attention i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace
 is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today 
 in the course of taking my film
 to villages in the west bank in gaza and in east jerusalem  i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation 
 in a village called wallajeh  which sits very close to jerusalem  the community was facing a
  very similar plight to budrus they were going to be surrounded lose a lot of their lands
 and not have freedom of access  either to the west bank or jerusalem  
 they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention 
 so we organized a screening a week later
  the organizers say that the villagers upon seeing the story of budrus documented in a film felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing 
 that people cared  
 so they kept on going 
 on the israeli side there is a new peace movement called solidariot  which means solidarity in hebrew  
 the leaders of this movement have been using budrus
 as one of their primary recruiting tools  
 they report that israelis who had never been active before  upon seeing the film understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities  
 the examples of wallajeh  and the solidariot movement show that even a
  independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior  
 now imagine the power that big media players could have
 if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like bil 'in ni 'lin wallajeh  
 in jerusalem neighborhoods like sheikh jarrah and silwan
 the nonviolent leaders
 would become more visible  valued and effective in their work i believe that
 the most important thing is is to understand that if we don 't pay attention
 to these efforts  they are invisible and it 's as if they never happened but i have seen first hand that
 if we do they will multiply
  multiply  if they multiply their influence will grow in the overall 
  conflict and theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation 
 these leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like budrus  let 's give them attention
 so they can prove it works everywhere
