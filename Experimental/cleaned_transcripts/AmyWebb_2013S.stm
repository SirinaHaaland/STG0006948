  name is amy webb and a few years ago i found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion  
 and i
  what 's wrong with me i don 't understand why this keeps happening  so i asked everybody in my life what they thought
 i turned to my grandmother who always had
 plenty of advice and she said stop being so picky you 've got to date around  and most importantly true love will find you
 when you least expect it now as it turns out  i 'm somebody who thinks a lot about
  i am constantly swimming in numbers formulas and charts
  i also have a very tight knit family and i 'm very very close with my sister and as a result i wanted to have the same type of family when i grew up  so i 'm at the end of this bad breakup i 'm thirty years old 
 i figure
 i 'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months
 before i 'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of
  have to do that for a while before we can get engaged  
 and if i want to start having children by the time i 'm thirty five that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago  
 so that wasn 't going to work if my strategy was to least expect my way into true love then the variable that i had to deal with was serendipity
  in short i was trying to figure out what 's the probability of my finding mr right well 
  the time i was living in the city of philadelphia and it 's a big city  and i figured
 in this entire place there are lots of possibilities  so again i started doing some math 
 population of philadelphia it
 has one point five million people i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to seven hundred and fifty thousand i 'm
 looking for a guy between the ages of thirty and thirty six which
 was only four percent of the population so now i 'm dealing with the possibility of thirty thousand men i was looking for somebody who was jewish because
  and that was important to me that 's only two point three percent of the population
 i figure i 'm attracted to maybe one out of ten of those men and there was no way i was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer
  so that basically meant there were thirty five men for me that i could
 possibly date
 in the entire city of
  in the meantime my very large jewish family
 was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children and i felt like i was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already 
 so i have two possible strategies at this point i 'm sort of figuring out one i can take my grandmother 's advice and sort of
  my way into maybe bumping into the one
  city of philadelphia or
 i could try online dating 
 now i like the idea of online dating because it 's predicated on an algorithm  and that 's really just a simple way of saying i 've got a problem i 'm going to use some data run it through a system and get to a solution 
 so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other
  but as it turns out algorithms have been around for thousands of years
 in almost every culture  in fact in judaism there were matchmakers a long time ago and though they didn 't have an explicit algorithm per se they definitely were running through formulas in their heads like 
 is the girl going to like the boy are the families going to get along what 's the rabbi going to say are they going to start having children right away
 the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this put two people together and that would be the end of it  so in my case i thought
  well  will data
 and an algorithm lead me to my prince charming  
 so i decided to sign on now there was one small catch as i 'm signing on to the various dating websites 
 as it happens i was really really busy but that actually that actually wasn 't the biggest problem  
 the biggest problem is that i hate filling out questionnaires of any kind
 and i certainly don 't like questionnaires that are like cosmo quizzes  so i just copied
  and pasted from my rsum 
 so in the descriptive part up top  i said that i was an award winning journalist 
 and a future thinker when i was asked about fun activities and my ideal date i said monetization
  obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward  
 but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates what turned out to be truly
 awful dates there was this guy
  the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data
 and ' 80s music and so i agreed to go out with him  
 so steve the i t guy invited me out to one of philadelphia 's white table cloth extremely expensive restaurants 
 and we went in and right off the bat our conversation really wasn 't taking flight
 but he was ordering a lot of food in fact he didn 't even bother looking at the menu he was ordering multiple appetizers multiple
  me as well  and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table also lots and lots of bottles of wine
  so we 're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner and i 've decided steve the i t guy and i are really just not meant for each other but we 'll part ways as friends 
 when he gets up to go to the bathroom 
 and in the meantime  the bill comes to
  i 'm a modern woman i am totally down with with splitting the bill but then steve the i t guy didn 't come back and
 that was my entire month 's rent audience
 gasps so needless to say  i was not having a good night  
 so i run home  i call my mother  i call my sister and as i do at the end of each one of these terrible
  you 're just being too picky 
 so i said fine from here on out i 'm only going on dates where i know there 's wi fi and i 'm bringing my laptop i 'm
 going to shove it into my bag  i 'm going to have this email template  and i 'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible
  started tracking things like
 really stupid awkward sexual remarks bad vocabulary 
 the number of times a man forced me to high five him 
 so i started to crunch some numbers  and that allowed me to make some correlations  so as it turns out
  some reason men who drink scotch reference kinky sex immediately well 
 it turns out that these probably weren 't bad guys there were just bad for me  and as it happens the algorithms that were setting us up 
 they weren 't bad either these algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do  which was to take our
 see the real problem here is that while the algorithms work just fine you and i don 't when confronted with blank windows where we 're supposed to input our information online 
 very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves  
 the other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like are you a dog person or a cat person
  do you like horror films or romance films  i 'm not looking for a pen pal i 'm looking for a husband right 
 so there 's a certain amount of superficiality in that data  so i said fine  i 've got a new plan i 'm going to keep using these online dating sites but i 'm going to treat them as databases 
 and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up i think i 'm going to try 
  this entire system  so knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people
  decided instead to ask my own questions what was every single possible thing that i could think of that i was looking for in a mate  so i started writing
 and writing
 and writing 
 and at the end i had amassed seventy two different data points  i wanted somebody was jew ish so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and
 thoughts on our culture but wasn 't going to force me to go to shul every
  friday and saturday  
 i wanted somebody who worked hard 
 because work for me is extremely important but not too hard for me  the hobbies that i have are really just new work projects that i 've launched
  i also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that i do  so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three
  maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it 
 so things like that but i also wanted somebody who would go to far flung exotic places like petra jordan  
 i also wanted somebody who would weigh twenty pounds more than me at all times regardless of what i weighed 
 so i now have these seventy two different data points  which to be
  so what i did was i went through and i prioritized that list i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points
  and i ranked everything starting at one hundred
 and going all the way down to ninety one 
 and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart who would challenge and stimulate me  and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points
  these things were also important to me but not
  had all this done i then built a scoring system  because
 what i wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not i thought the guy that i found online would be a match with me 
 i figured there would be a minimum of seven hundred points before i would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message 
 for nine hundred points i 'd agree to go out on a date  and i wouldn 't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the one thousand five hundred point threshold
 well as it turns out  this worked pretty well  so i go back online now i found
 who 's incredibly good looking incredibly well spoken he had hiked mt fuji  he had walked along the great wall he likes to travel as long as it doesn 't involve a cruise ship and i thought  
 done it i 've cracked the code i have just found the jewish prince charming
 of my family 's dreams there was only one problem  
 he didn 't like me back  
 and i guess the one variable that i haven 't considered is the competition who are all of the other women on these dating sites  
  as teacher she said she is silly nice and friendly she likes to make people laugh alot 
 at this moment i knew  clicking profile after profile after profile that looked like this that i needed to do some market research  so
 i created ten fake male profiles now before i lose all of you 
  that i did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system  i didn 't carry on crazy catfish style relationships with anybody  
 i really was just scraping their data  but i didn 't want everybody 's data  i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that i really really wanted to marry
 when i released these men into the wild i did follow some rules  so i didn 't reach out to any woman first
  just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract 
 and mainly what i was looking at was two different data sets so i was looking at qualitative data  so what was the humor the tone  the voice the communication style that these women shared in common 
 and also quantitative data  so what was the average length of their profile how much time was spent between messages  
  i wanted to figure out how to maximize my own
 profile online well one month later  i had
 a lot of data and i was able to do another analysis  and as it turns out  content matters a lot so smart people tend to write a lot three thousand four thousand five thousand words about
  which may all be very very interesting the challenge here though is that the popular men and women are sticking to ninety seven words on average
 that are written very very well  even though it may not seem like it all the time
  the other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they 're using non specific language  so in my case the english patient is my most favorite movie ever
  but
 it doesn 't work
  to use that in a profile because that 's a superficial data point and somebody may disagree and decide they don 't want to go out because they didn 't like sitting through the three hour movie 
 also optimistic language matters a lot so this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women words like fun and girl and love 
 and what i realized was not that i had to dumb down my own profile remember i 'm somebody who said that i speak fluent
  and i know javascript and i was okay with that the difference is that it 's about being more approachable
 and and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you 
 and as it turns out timing is also really really important just because you have access to somebody 's mobile phone number or their instant message account
 and it 's two o 'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake doesn 't mean that that 's a good time to to communicate with those people the popular women on on these online sites
 spend an average of twenty three hours in between each communication
 and that 's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship  and finally
 there were the photos all of the women who were popular showed some skin
 they all looked really great  which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had uploaded 
  as it turns out
  telling them about this fabulous news and they say this is wonderful how soon are you going out 
 i said actually i 'm not going to go out with anybody because remember in my scoring system they have to reach a minimum threshold of seven hundred points and none of them have done that they said 
 what you 're still being too damn picky well not too long after that i found this guy 
  and he said that he was culturally jewish  he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter  which i thought was very clever
 he talked
 in detail about travel he made a lot of really interesting cultural references he looked and talked exactly like what i wanted 
 and immediately he scored eight hundred and fifty points it was enough for a date 
 three weeks later we met up in person for
  that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant and when he dropped me back off at my house that night i re scored him [ one thousand and fifty points ]
 thought you know what this entire time i haven 't been picky enough well a year and a half after that we were non cruise ship traveling
 through petra jordan  when he got down on his knee and
  year after that we were married and about a year and a half after that our daughter petra was born audience oh [ what it means
 obviously i 'm having a fabulous life so 
 the question is what does all of this mean for you well  as it turns out  there is an algorithm for love it 's just not the ones that we 're being presented with online  in fact
 it 's something that you write yourself so whether you 're looking for a husband or a wife or you 're trying to find your passion or you 're trying to start a business 
 all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules and feel free to be as picky as you want 
 well on my wedding day i had a conversation again with my grandmother and she said 
 all right maybe i was wrong it looks like you did come up with a really really great system
  now your matzah balls  they should be fluffy not hard and i 'll take her advice on
