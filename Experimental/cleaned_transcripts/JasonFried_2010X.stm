  why people can 't seem to get work done at work  which is a problem we all kind of have but let 's sort of start at the beginning so we have companies and
  and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort  and they expect these people
 who work for them to do great work
 i would hope at least at least good work hopefully at least it 's good work
 hopefully great work  and so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work  
 so a company or a charity or an organization of any kind unless you 're working in africa
  lucky to do that most people have to go to an office every day  
 and so these companies they build offices they go out and they buy a building  or they rent a building  or they lease some space
 and they fill this space with stuff they fill it with tables or desks chairs computer
  maybe a fridge  maybe a few other things 
 and they expect their employees or their volunteers to come to that location every day to do great work  
 it seems like it 's perfectly reasonable to to ask that however if you actually talk to people
 and even question yourself and you ask yourself 
 where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done  you 'll find out that people don 't say what businesses think they would say  if you ask people the question where do you
  need to go when you need to get something done
 typically you get three different kinds of answers 
 one is kind of a place or a location or a room another one is a moving object  and a third is a time  so here are some examples
 i 've been asking people this question for about ten years where do you go when you really need to get something done i 'll hear things like the
  'll hear things like an extra room in the house  the basement  the coffee shop the library  
 and then you 'll hear things like the train 
 a plane a car so the commute  
 and then you 'll hear people say well  it doesn 't really matter where i am as long as it 's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends 
 you almost never hear
  but businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office and they 're making people go to it all the time yet people don 't do work in the office  what is that about 
 why is that why is that happening  and what you find out is if you dig a little bit deeper you find out that people
 this is what happens people go to work  and they 're basically trading in their work day for a series of work moments that 's what happens at the office
  you don 't have a work day anymore you have work moments it 's like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart  
 and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits because you have fifteen minutes here thirty minutes there and something else happens you 're pulled off your work then you have twenty minutes then it 's lunch  then you have something else to do  
 then you 've got fifteen minutes and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question
  and you look back on the day  and you realize that you didn 't get anything done
  we 've all been through this we probably went through it yesterday or the day before or the day before that you look back on your day and you 're like i got nothing done today  
 i was at work i sat at my desk i used my expensive computer  
 i used the software they told me to use i went to these meetings i was asked to go to
 i did these conference calls i did all this stuff  but i didn 't actually
 do anything i just did tasks i didn 't actually get meaningful work done 
 and what you what you find is that especially with creative people designers  programmers  writers  engineers  thinkers
 that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done  
 you cannot ask somebody to be creative in fifteen minutes and really think about a problem you might have a quick
  idea but to be
 in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully you need long stretches of uninterrupted time 
 and even though the work day is typically eight hours  
 how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office how about seven hours  six five four when 's the last time you had three hours to yourself
  very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office and this is why people choose to do work
 at home  or they might go to the office but they might go to the office really early in the day 
 or late at night when no one 's around or they stick around after everyone 's left or go in on the weekends  or they get work done on the plane 
 in the car or in the train because there are no distractions  now there are different kinds of distractions but not the really bad
  about in a minute  
 and this whole phenomenon of having
 short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn 't work when you 're interrupted and that is sleep  
 i think that sleep and work are very closely related not because you can work while you 're sleeping and sleep while you 're working that 's not really what i mean
  is about sleep phases  or stages some people call them different things there are five of them  
 and in order to get to the really deep ones the meaningful ones you have to go through the early ones  if you 're interrupted while you 're going through the early ones if someone bumps you in bed or there 's a sound or whatever happens you don 't just pick up where you left off
  if you 're interrupted and woken up you have to start again  
 so you have to go back a few phases and start again  and what ends up happening you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning or whenever you get up and you 're like 
 i didn 't sleep very well  i did the sleep thing i went to bed i laid down  but i didn 't really 
  don 't go to sleep you go towards sleep it takes a while you 've got to go through phases and stuff  and if you 're interrupted you don 't sleep well  so does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they 're interrupted all night  i don 't think anyone would say yes 
 why do we expect people to work well if they 're being interrupted all day at the office  
 how can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted that doesn 't really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me 
 so what are the interruptions that
  happen at the office but not at other places  because in other places you can have interruptions like the tv  
 or you could go for a walk or there 's a fridge downstairs or you 've got your own couch or whatever you want to do 
 if you talk to certain managers they 'll tell you that
 they don 't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions
  but that 's one of the excuses that managers give and i 'm one of these managers i understand i know how this goes we all have to improve on this sort of thing
  but oftentimes they 'll cite distractions i can 't let someone work at home they 'll watch tv or do this other thing 
 it turns out those aren 't the things that are distracting  because those are voluntary
  you decide when you want to be distracted by the tv when you want to turn something on or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk 
 at the office  most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary  
 so let 's go through a couple of those 
 now managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work
 are things like facebook and twitter
  and youtube
 and other websites  and in fact they 'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work some of you may work at places where you can 't get to certain sites i
 mean is this china what the hell is going on here 
 you can 't go to a website at work and that 's the problem that 's why people aren 't getting work done because they 're on facebook and twitter that 's kind of ridiculous it 's a total
 decoy 
 today 's facebook and twitter and youtube these things are just modern day smoke breaks no one cared about letting
  people take a smoke break for fifteen minutes ten years ago so why does anyone care if someone goes to facebook or twitter or youtube here and there those aren 't the real problems in the office  
 the real problems
 are what i like to call the m & ms the managers and the meetings those are the real problems in the modern office today  
 and this is why things don 't get done at work  it 's because of the m
  what 's interesting is  if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work like at home in the car on a plane  late at night or early in the morning  you don 't find managers and meetings 
  you find a lot of other distractions but not managers and meetings so these are the things that you don 't find elsewhere but you do find at the office 
  interrupting people they don 't really do the work so they make sure everyone else is doing work which is an interruption
 we have lots of managers in the world now and a lot of people in the world and a lot of interruptions by these managers they have to check in hey how 's it going show me what 's up this sort of thing
 they keep interrupting you at the wrong time while you 're actually trying to do something they 're paying you to do  
  but what 's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all which is call meetings and meetings are just toxic  terrible 
 poisonous things
 during the day at work 
 we all know this to be true  and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees it doesn 't work that way the manager calls the meeting
 so the employees can all come together and it 's an incredibly disruptive thing to do
  to people to say hey look we 're going to bring ten people together right now and have a meeting  
 i don 't care what you 're doing you 've got to stop doing it so you can have this meeting i mean what are the chances that all ten people are ready to stop 
 what if they 're thinking about something important or doing important work  all of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else 
 so they go into a meeting room they get together and
  talk about stuff that doesn 't really matter usually because meetings aren 't work meetings are places to go to talk about things you 're supposed to be doing later  
 but meetings also procreate  
 so one meeting tends to lead to another meeting which leads to another meeting  there 's often too many people in the meetings and they 're very very expensive to the organization 
 companies often think of a one hour meeting as a one hour meeting but that 's not true unless there 's only one person
 it 's a 10 hour meeting not a one hour meeting 
 it 's ten hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one hour meeting  which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes  
 but instead there 's a long scheduled meeting  because meetings are scheduled the way software works which is in increments of fifteen minutes or thirty minutes or an hour  
 you don 't schedule an eight hour meeting with outlook  you can 't
  minutes or thirty minutes or forty five minutes or an hour  and so we tend to fill these times up when things should go really quickly  
 so meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today especially at offices these things don 't exist outside of the office
  so i have some suggestions to
 remedy the situation  what can managers do enlightened managers hopefully
 what can they do to make the
  office a better place for people to work so it 's not the last resort  but it 's the first resort  so that people start to say when i really want to get stuff done i go to the office 
 because the offices are well equipped everything is there for them to do the work but they don 't want to go there right now so how do we change that 
 i have three suggestions to share with you i have about three minutes so that 'll fit perfectly
  one thursday once a month  and cut it in half just the afternoon i 'll make it easy for you so just the afternoon one thursday first thursday of the month just the afternoon  nobody in the office can talk to each other 
 just silence  that 's it  
 and what you 'll find
 is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other this is when people
  actually get stuff done  is when no one 's bothering them or interrupting them 
 giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work  
 it 's better than a computer better than than a new monitor better than new software or whatever people typically use 
 giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable
 if you try
  hopefully you can do it more often so maybe it 's every other week  or every week once a week  afternoons no one can talk to each other  that 's something that you 'll find will really really work
 another thing you can try is switching from active communication and collaboration which is like face to face stuff tapping people on the shoulder saying hi to them  having meetings and replace that with more passive models of communication 
 using things like email and instant messaging or collaboration
  products things like that 
 now some people might say email is really distracting i m is really distracting  and these other things are really distracting  but they 're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing 
 you can quit the email app  you can 't quit your boss  
 you can quit i m you can 't hide your manager
  you can put these things away and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule at your own time when you 're available when you 're ready to go
  again because work like sleep happens in phases  so you 'll be going up doing some work and then you 'll come down from that work and then maybe it 's time to check that email 
  very very few things that are that urgent that need to happen that need to be answered right this second  
 so if you 're a manager start encouraging people to use more things like i m and email and other things that someone
  can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule and the last suggestion i have
 is that if you do have a meeting coming up if you have the power just cancel it just cancel that next meeting laughter
 today 's friday  usually people have meetings on monday just don 't have it
 i don 't mean move it  i mean just erase it from memory it 's gone  and you 'll find out that everything will be just
  all these discussions and
 decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at nine a m on monday  just forget about them and things will be fine people will have a more open morning  they can actually think you 'll find out  all these things you thought you had to do you don 't actually have to do  
 so those are just three quick suggestions i wanted to give you guys to think about i hope that some of these ideas were at least
 provocative enough for for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people more time to get work done
 i think it 'll all pay off in the end so thanks for listening
