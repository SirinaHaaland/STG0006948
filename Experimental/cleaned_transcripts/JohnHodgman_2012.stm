  to unpack for you three examples of iconic
 design and it makes perfect sense that i should be the one to do it because i have a bachelor 's degree in literature 
 but i 'm also a famous minor television personality
 and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs so
 i pretty much know everything there is now 
 i 'm sure you recognize this object many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at los angeles
 international airport over the past couple of days this is known as
  that is its name for reasons that are still very murky 
 and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient
 extraterrestrial architecture it was first excavated in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one as they were building
 lax although scientists believe that it dates back to the year two thousand
  when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port
 by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet
 and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology
 and the gift of revolving restaurants it is thought
 to have been a replacement for the older space ports located
  of course at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design 
 the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously the much better access to parking when it was uncovered  
 it ushered in a new era of streamlined  archaically futuristic design called googie  which came to be synonymous with the jet age a
  after all the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often preferring instead to travel
 by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls 
 ah yes a table we use these every day and on top of it the juicy
  this is a design by philippe starck who i believe is in the audience at this very moment and you can tell it is a starck design by its precision  its playfulness its
 innovation and its promise of imminent violence 
 it is a design that challenges your intuition it is not what you think it is when you first see it it is not a fork designed to grab three hors d 'oeuvres at a time  
 which would be useful out in the
  lobby i would say  and despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey ness and tripodism  
 it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts  
 it is in fact a citrus juicer and when i say that you never see it as anything else
  it is also not a monument to design it is a monument to design 's
 utility you can take it home with you unlike the theme building  which will stay where it is forever 
 this is affordable and can come home with you
 and as such it can sit on your kitchen counter
 it can 't go in your drawers trust me i found that out the hard way
 and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design one other
  thing about it if you do have one at home let me tell you one of the features you may not know when you fall asleep  it comes alive
 and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep
  i have no idea  i don 't know what that thing is it looks terrible is it a little hot plate  i don 't get it 
 does anyone know chi it 's an
  iphone iphone oh yes that 's right i remember those  i had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days no
 i have an iphone of course i do here is my
 on this little device i like to read books on it  more than that i like to buy books on it that i never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and i never look at them again and it 's perfect  
 i use it every day to measure the weight of an ox for example every now and then
  admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally
  and yet i forget about it all the time this is a design that once you saw it you forgot about it it is easy to forget
 the gasp inducement that occurred in two thousand and seven
 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how
 instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life
 unlike
 the theme building this is not alien technology or i should say  what it did was it took technology which unlike people in this room to many other people in the world still feels very alien 
 and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate  and unlike the juicy salif  
 it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain  
 rather it simply
  itself to your brain 
 and you didn 't even notice it happened  so there you go my name is john hodgman i just explained
 design  thank you very much
