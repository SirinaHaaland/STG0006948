  we invent my company invents
 all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas and we do that for a couple of reasons we invent for fun
 invention is a lot of fun to do and we also invent for profit
  related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn 't fun you wouldn 't have the time to do it  so
 we do this fun and profit oriented inventing for most of what we do but we also have a program where we invent for humanity
 where we take some of our best inventors  and we say are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems which is
  with dramatic crazy out of the box solutions 
 bill gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work so thank you 
 so i 'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have
 and a couple of problems where we 've got some solutions underway 
  vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health a fantastic thing
  but in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they 're administered 
 and that 's because they need to be kept cold  almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures they go bad very quickly if you don 't 
 and if you don 't have stable power grid this doesn 't happen  so kids die  
 it 's not just the loss of the vaccine
  it 's the fact that those kids don 't get vaccinated  this is one of the ways that
 vaccines are carried these are styrofoam chests these are being carried by people but they 're also put on the backs of pickup trucks  we 've got a different solution  
 now  one of these styrofoam chests
 will last for about four hours with ice in it and we thought well that 's not really good enough  so we made this thing  
 this lasts six months with no power
 absolutely zero power because it loses less than a half a watt  
 now  this is our second generations prototype  the third generation prototype is right now  in uganda being tested 
 now  the reason we were able to come up with this is is two key ideas one is that this is similar to a cryogenic dewar something you 'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in 
 they have incredible insulation
 let 's put some incredible insulation here  the other idea is kind of interesting 
 which is you can 't reach inside anymore 
 because if you open it up and reach inside you 'd let the heat in the game would be over so the inside of this thing actually looks like a coke machine 
 it vends out little individual vials  
 so a simple idea which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in africa and around the world
 'll move on to malaria malaria is one of the great public health problems
  esther duflo talked a little bit about this two hundred million people a year 
 every forty three seconds a child in africa dies
 twenty seven will die during my talk 
 and there 's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the
  involved
  another comment of esther 's was that we react when there 's a tragedy like haiti but that tragedy is ongoing  
 so what can we do about it well there are a
 lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria  you can spray the problem is there are environmental issues  
 you can try to treat people and create awareness  that 's great except the places that have malaria really bad they don 't have health
  care systems 
 a vaccine would be a terrific thing only they don 't work yet 
 people have tried for a long time there are a couple of interesting candidates it 's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for 
 you can distribute bed nets  and bed nets are very effective if you use them you don 't always use them for that people fish with them they don
  bed nets have an effect on the epidemic but you 're never going to make it extinct with bed nets 
 now  malaria is an incredibly complicated disease  
 we could spend hours going over this it 's got this sort of soap opera like lifestyle they have sex  they burrow into your liver they tunnel into your blood cells  
 it 's an incredibly complicated
  but that 's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria there 's a lot of potential ways in 
 one of those ways might be better diagnosis  
 so we hope this year to prototype each of these devices 
 one does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic 's
 glucose meter works  you take a drop of blood you put it in there and it automatically tells you today  you need to do a
  complicated laboratory procedure create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it the other thing
 is you know it would be even better if you didn 't have to draw the blood  
 and if you look through the eye  or you look at the the vessels on the white of the eye  
 in fact you may be able to do this directly without drawing any blood at all or through your nail beds because if you actually look through your fingernails
 you can see blood vessels and once you see blood vessels we think we can see the malaria 
 we can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin  it 's produced by the malaria parasite
 and it 's a very interesting crystalline substance interesting anyway if you 're a solid state physicist there 's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it  
 this is our femtosecond laser lab
  this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond that 's really really really short  
 this is a pulse of light that 's only about one wavelength of light long so it 's a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously  
 it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things in particular it lets you find hemozoin so here 's an image of red blood cells  and now we can actually
  map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells  
 and using both this technique and other optical techniques we think we can make those diagnostics 
 we also have another 
 therapy for malaria a way in acute cases to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system sort of like doing dialysis but for relieving the parasite
 this is our thousand core supercomputer  we 're kind of software guys  
 and so nearly any problem that you pose we like to try to solve with some software 
 one of the problems that you have if you 're trying to eradicate malaria or  or reduce it is you don 't know what 's the most effective thing to do
  we heard about bed nets earlier you spend a certain amount per bed net 
 or you could spray  you can give drug administration there 's all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness 
 how can you tell so we 've created  
 using our our supercomputer the world 's best computer model of malaria  which we 'll show you now 
 we picked madagascar  we have every
  square inch of madagascar  we have all of the precipitation data
 and the temperature data that 's very important because the humidity and precipitation
 tell you whether you 've got
 standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed 
 so that sets the stage on which you do this you then have to introduce the mosquitoes and you have to model that
 and how they come and go  ultimately it gives you this
  this is malaria spreading across madagascar  
 and this is this latter part of the rainy season we 're going to the dry season now  it nearly goes away in the dry season because there 's no place for the
 mosquitoes to breed  and then of course the next year it comes roaring back 
 by doing these kinds of
  we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times
 in software before we actually have to do it in real life to be able to simulate both the the economic trade offs how many bed nets versus how much spraying
  or the social trade offs what happens if unrest breaks out 
 we also try to study our foe  this is a high speed camera view of a
  in a moment  
 we 're going to see a view of the airflow here we 're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we 're illuminating with a laser  
 by understanding how mosquitoes fly we hope to understand how to make them not fly  
 now  one of the ways you can make them not fly is with ddt  this is a real ad
  make up once upon a time this was the primary technique and in fact many countries got rid of malaria through ddt the united states did 
  there were one hundred and fifty thousand cases a year of malaria in the united states but ddt and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it  
 so we
 we 've done all these things that are focused on the plasmodium the parasite involved what can we do to the mosquito
 well let 's try to kill it with consumer electronics 
 now  that sounds silly but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use your blu ray player has a very cheap blue laser 
 your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that 's used to steer a laser beam very accurately that 's what makes those little dots on the
  signal processing and digital cameras  so what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers
  disbelief for a moment  and let 's think of what could happen if we could do that 
 well we could protect very high value targets like clinics clinics are full of people that have malaria they 're sick and so they 're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes you really want 
  to protect them of course if you do that you could also protect your backyard  
 our photons are one hundred percent organic they 're completely natural 
 now  it actually gets better than this  
 you could if you 're really smart you could shine a a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it 
 and you could listen to the wing beat frequency
 and you could measure the size 
  and then you could decide is this an insect i want to kill or an insect i don 't want to kill 
 moore 's law made computing cheap so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect
 and decide thumbs up
 or thumbs down now
 it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes they 're the only ones that are are dangerous mosquitoes only
  comes from nectar from flowers in fact  in the lab we feed ours raisins
 but the female needs the blood meal  so this sounds really crazy right would you like to see it
  after thinking about this a little bit we thought you know it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser so eric johanson who built the device actually with parts from ebay  
 and pablos holman over here he 's got mosquitoes in the tank 
 we have the device over here  and we 're going to show you
  instead of the kill laser which will be a very brief  instantaneous pulse  we 're going to have a green laser pointer that 's going to stay on the mosquito for actually quite a long period of time otherwise you can 't see it very well  
 take it away eric eric johanson 
 what we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage  and we have 
 this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around and pablos if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit
 we can see them flying
  that 's a fairly straightforward image processing routine  and let me show you how it works here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they 're flying around  which is
 kind of fun 
 next we can actually light them up with a laser 
 laughter now  this is a low powered laser  and we can actually pick up a wing beat frequency so you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around nm that 's a mosquito wing beat you 're hearing 
  let 's see what this looks like 
 there you can see mosquitoes as they fly around being lit up this is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what 's happening here we have it running at high speed mode so this system that was built for ted is here to illustrate
 that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this and we 're looking very hard at
 how to make it highly  cost effective to use in places like africa and
  it wouldn 't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit
  here 's another one bang an interesting thing is we kill them all the time  we 've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair the wing motor is
  here we 're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down so that 's what i have thanks very much
