  i am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves but first i want to tell you why i 'm here i 'm here for two reasons these two guys are my two sons ford
 and wren when ford was about three years old we shared a very small room together in a very small space
 my office was on one half of the bedroom and his bedroom was on the other half and you can imagine  if you 're a writer that
 things would get really crowded around deadlines so when wren was on the way i realized i needed to find a space of my own there was no more space in the house so i went out to the backyard  and without 
  any previous building experience and about three thousand dollars and some recycled materials i built this space 
  was enough space  and i had control which was very important  as i was building this space i thought to myself surely i 'm not the only guy to have to
 have carved out a space for his own so i did some research  and i found that there was an historic precedence hemingway had his writing space  
 elvis had two or three manspaces which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in graceland in the popular culture  superman had the
  of solitude and there was of course the batcave  so i realized then that
 i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now here is one of the first spaces i found it is in austin texas 
 which is where i 'm from on the outside it looks like a very typical garage a nice garage but on the inside it 's anything but 
  and this to me is a pretty classic manspace it has neon concert posters a bar and of course  the leg lamp which is very
 i soon realized that manspaces didn 't have to be only inside this guy built a bowling alley in his backyard 
 out of landscaping timbers  astroturf and he found the scoreboard in the trash  here 's another outdoor space a little bit more sophisticated this a one thousand nine hundred
  wooden tugboat made completely out of douglas fir the guy did it all himself and there is about one thousand square feet of hanging out space inside  
 so 
 pretty early on in my investigations i realized what i was finding was not what i expected to find which was quite frankly a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat screen
  tvs  there were definitely hang out spots but some were for working some were for playing
  some were for guys to collect their things most of all i was just surprised with what i was finding  
 take this place for example 
 on the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage this is in long island new york the only thing that might tip you off is the round window 
 on the inside it 's a recreation of a 
  16th century japanese tea house the man imported all the materials from japan  and he hired a japanese carpenter
 to build it in the traditional style  it has no nails or screws all the joints are
 hand carved and hand scribed here is another pretty typical scene this is a suburban las vegas neighborhood but you open one of the garage doors
 and there is a professional size boxing ring inside and so there is a good reason for this it was built by this man
 who is wayne mccullough he won the silver medal for ireland in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety two olympics
  and he trains in this space he trains other people and right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments which is another sort of important part about a manspace  
 so  while this space represents someone 's profession this one certainly represents a passion  
 it 's made to look like the inside of an english sailing ship it 's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s museum quality  
 so as i came to the end of my journey i found over fifty spaces and they were unexpected and they were
  surprising but they were also i was really impressed by how personalized they were and how much work went into them 
 and i realized that 's because the guys that i met were all very passionate about what they did and they really loved their professions and they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies  and so they created these spaces
 to reflect what they love to do and who they were
