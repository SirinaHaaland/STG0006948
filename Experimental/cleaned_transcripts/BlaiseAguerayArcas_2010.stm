  about a year and a half ago  stephen lawler  who also gave a talk here at ted in two thousand and seven on virtual earth brought me over
 to become the architect of bing maps which is microsoft 's
  in the past two and a half we 've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online  
 and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that that one is used to 
 so the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning which if you 're familiar at all with seadragon that 's where it comes from 
 mapping is of course  not just about
  it 's also about imagery so as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city like
 virtual view at forty five degrees this can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3d structure of the city all the facades 
 now  we see this space this three dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts
  are really just one of them if you click on
 on this you 'll see some of the ones that we 've put out just in the past couple of months since we 've launched so for example a couple of days after the disaster in haiti we had
 an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky  this wonderful one which i don 't have time to show you is taking
  blogs in real time and mapping those stories those entries
 to the places that are referred to on the blogs it 's wonderful  but i 'm  i 'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff so
 we see the imagery of course not stopping at the sky  these little green bubbles
 represent photosynths that users have made  i 'm not going to dive into them
  but photosynths are integrated into the map everything that 's cased in blue is an area where we 've taken imagery on the ground as well 
 and so when you fly down thank you when
 you fly down to the ground  and you see this this kind of panoramic imagery the first thing that you might notice is that it 's not just a picture  there 's
  just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of of the three dimensional city from above so if i click on
  something to get a closer view of it  
 then the fact that that transition looks as it does is a function of all of that geometry all of that 3d understanding behind this model 
 now i 'll
 show you a a fun app
 that we 've we 've been working on a collaboration
 friends at flickr this takes flickr  georegistered imagery
 and uses photosynth like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery so
 i 'm not sure if that 's the one i actually meant to pull up but 
 but notice this is of course a popular tourist site and there are lots of photos around here  and these photos are all taken at different
  taken around five  so that 's the flickr photo that 's our imagery
  so you really see how how this kind of crowd sourced imagery is integrating in a very deep way  into the map itself
 there are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them of course is time travel and i 'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery
  there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well  but what 's what 's cool about this is that not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with
 things that are coming in from users but it also is the is the foundation for augmented reality  and that 's something that i 'll be showing you more of in just a moment 
 now i just made a transition indoors that 's also interesting ok notice there 's now a roof above us we 're inside
 the pike place market  and this is something that we 're able to do with a backpack camera so we 're now
  not only not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars  but we 're also imaging
 inside and from here we 're able to do the same sorts of registration  not only of
 of still images but also of video so this is something that we 're now going to try
  all right i 'm hitting it i 'm punching play  i 'm live  all right there we go so these are our friends in pike place market
  you pan back over to the corner market  because i want to show points of interest 
 no no the other way yeah yeah back to the corner back to the corner i don 't want to see you
  back to the corner  back to the corner  back to the corner  ok never mind  
 what i wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way  if you 're actually on the spot
 you can think about this this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality
  let me just take a moment and thank the team they 've done a fantastic job of
  'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside  and while i while i walk outside i 'll just mention that
 here we 're using this for telepresence but you can equally well use this
 on the spot for augmented reality when you use it on the spot it means that you 're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you so here we 're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it that was being broadcast by the way on a
  all right and now there 's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years
  and that 's curtis wong worldwide telescope 
 so we 're going to head over to the dumpsters where it 's traditional after a long day at the market to go out for a break but also stare up at the sky 
 this is the integration of worldwide telescope
 into
 our maps
  current
 thank you this is the current time  if we scrub the time then we can see how
 the sky will look at different times and we can get all of this very detailed information about
 different different times different dates  let 's move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe change the
 change the date i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon
  so this is an astronomically complete representation of the of the sky integrated right into
 right into the earth all right now i 've overrun my time so i 've got to stop thank you all very much
