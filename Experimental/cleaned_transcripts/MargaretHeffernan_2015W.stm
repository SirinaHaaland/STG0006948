  evolutionary biologist at purdue university named william muir
 studied chickens he was interested in productivity i think it 's something that concerns all of us
 but it 's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs he wanted to know what could make
  his chickens more productive so he devised a beautiful experiment 
 chickens live in groups so first of all he selected just an average flock and he let it alone for six generations  
 but then he created a second group of the individually most productive chickens you could call them 
 and he put them together in a superflock and each generation he selected only the most productive
 for breeding after six generations had passed what did he find 
 well the first group  the average group was doing just fine they were all plump and fully feathered and egg production had increased dramatically 
 what about the second group  
 well all but three were dead
  the individually productive chickens had only achieved their success
 by suppressing
 the productivity of the rest 
 now as i 've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story in all sorts of organizations and companies people have seen the relevance almost instantly and they come up
  that 's my life 
 all my life i 've been told that the way we have to get ahead is to compete get into the right school get into the right job get to the top  
 and i 've really never found it very inspiring i 've started and run businesses because invention is a joy
  alongside brilliant creative people is its own reward  and i 've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by 
 or by superstars  but for the past fifty years we 've run most organizations and some societies
 along
  we 've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars  the brightest men or occasionally women in the room  
 and giving them all the resources and all the power  
 and the result has been just the same as in william muir 's experiment  aggression  dysfunction
 and waste if the only way the most productive can be successful is by suppressing the productivity of the rest
  we badly need to find a better way to work and a richer way to live so
 what is it that makes some groups
 obviously more successful and more productive than others  well that 's the question a team
  at mit took to research they brought in hundreds of volunteers they put them into groups and they gave them very hard problems to solve 
 and what happened was exactly what you 'd expect that some groups were very much more successful than others  
 but what was really interesting was that the high achieving groups were not those where they had one or two people with spectacularly high i q 
 nor were the most successful groups
  they had three characteristics  the really successful teams 
 first of all they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other  
 this is measured by something called the reading the mind in the eyes test it 's broadly considered a test for empathy  and the groups that scored highly on this
 did better 
  the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other  so that no one voice dominated  but neither were there any passengers  
 and thirdly  the more successful groups
 had more women in them 
 now  
 was this because women typically score more highly on the reading the mind in the eyes test so you 're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient 
 or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective we
  don 't really know but the striking thing about this experiment
 is that it showed what we know which is some groups do better than others  but what 's key to that
 is their social connectedness to each other  so how does this play out in the real world well it means that what happens
  because in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other  ideas can flow and grow people don 't get stuck  they don 't waste energy down dead ends an example
 arup is one of the world 's most successful engineering firms  
 and it was commissioned to build the equestrian center for the beijing olympics  now this building had to receive two and a half thousand
 really highly strung
  thoroughbred horses that were coming off long haul flights highly jet lagged not feeling their finest  and the problem the engineer confronted was 
 what quantity of waste to cater for 
 now you don 't get taught this in engineering school 
 and it 's not really the kind of thing you want to get wrong  so he could have spent months talking to vets
  doing the research tweaking the spreadsheet  instead he asked for help
 and he found someone who had designed the jockey club in new york the problem was solved in less than a day
 arup believes that the culture of helpfulness is central to their success  
  helpfulness sounds really anemic  
 but it 's absolutely core to successful teams  and it routinely outperforms
 individual intelligence helpfulness means i don 't have to know everything 
 i just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help at sap they reckon that you can
  answer any question in seventeen minutes  but there isn 't a single high tech company i 've worked with that imagines for a moment
 that this is a technology
 issue  because what drives helpfulness
 is people getting to know each other  now that sounds so obvious  and we think
 it 'll just happen normally  but it doesn 't when i was
  my first software company 
 i realized that we were getting stuck there was a lot of friction 
 but not much else  and i gradually realized the brilliant creative people that i 'd hired
 didn 't know each other  they were so focused on their own individual work they didn 't even know who they were sitting next to 
 and it was only when i insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other
 that we achieved
  momentum 
 now that was twenty years ago and now i visit companies that have banned coffee cups at desks because they want people to hang out around the coffee machines
 and talk to each other  the swedes even have a special term for this they call it fika which means more than a coffee break it means
 collective restoration at idexx a company up in maine
 they 've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business
 can work together and get to know the whole business that way  have they all gone mad  
 quite the opposite they 've figured out that when the going gets tough and it always will get tough if you 're doing breakthrough work
  what people need is social support and they need to know who to ask for help 
 companies don 't have ideas only people do  
 and what motivates people are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other  
 what matters is the mortar not just the bricks
  when you put all of this together what you get is something called social capital 
 social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust the term comes from sociologists who were studying communities
 that proved particularly resilient
 in times of stress social capital
 is what gives companies momentum and social capital is what makes companies robust
 what does this mean in practical terms it means that time
 is everything  because social capital compounds with time 
 so teams that work together longer get better because it takes time to develop the trust you need
 for real candor
 and openness
  is what builds value 
 when alex pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have time to talk to each other  
 profits went up fifteen million dollars  and employee satisfaction went up
 ten percent not a bad return on social capital which compounds
 even as you spend it
 now this isn 't about chumminess  and it 's no charter for slackers  because people who work this way tend to be kind of scratchy  impatient 
 absolutely determined to think for themselves because that 's what their contribution is 
 conflict is frequent
 because candor is safe
  and that 's how good ideas
 turn into great ideas  
 because no idea is born fully formed it emerges a little bit as a child is born kind of messy and confused  but full of possibilities  
 and it 's only through the generous contribution  faith and challenge
 that they achieve their potential
 and that 's what social capital
 supports 
 now we aren 't really used to talking about this about talent about creativity in this way we 're used to talking
 about stars  so i started to wonder  well if we start working
  this way does that mean no more stars  so i went and i sat in on the auditions at the royal academy of dramatic art in london
  and what i saw there really surprised me  
 because the teachers weren 't looking for individual pyrotechnics  they were looking for what happened
 between the students  because that 's where the
  and when i talked to producers of hit albums they said oh sure we have lots of superstars in music it 's just  they don 't last very long 
 it 's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best
 in themselves and when i went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity i couldn 't even see any superstars
  there
 really mattered  
 and when i reflected on my own career  
 and the extraordinary people i 've had the privilege to work with i realized how much more
 we could give each other
 if we just stopped trying to be
  once you appreciate
 truly how social work is 
 a lot of things have to change  
 management by talent contest has routinely pitted employees against each other  
 now rivalry has to be replaced
 by social capital for decades we 've tried to
  motivate people with money even though we 've got a vast amount of research that shows that money erodes social connectedness 
 now we need to let people
 motivate
 each other  and for years we 've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected all by themselves
  to solve complex problems now we need to redefine leadership
 as an activity in which conditions are created in which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together we know
 that this works 
 when the montreal protocol called for the phasing out of cfcs the chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer 
 the risks were
  immense  cfcs were everywhere and nobody knew if a substitute could be found  
 but one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles  
 the first was the head of engineering frank maslen said there will be no stars in this team 
 we need everybody everybody has a valid perspective
  second we work to one standard only the best
 imaginable and third he told his boss geoff tudhope that he had to butt out because he knew how disruptive
 power can be now  this didn 't mean  tudhope did nothing he gave the team air cover  and he listened to ensure that they honored their principles
  and it worked 
 ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem this group cracked it first 
 and to date the montreal protocol is the most successful international environmental
 agreement ever implemented there was a lot at stake then and there 's a lot at
  stake now and we won 't solve our problems
 if we expect it to be solved by a few supermen or superwomen now we need
 everybody  because it is only when we accept that everybody has value
 that we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need
 to create the best beyond measure
