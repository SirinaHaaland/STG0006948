  the vietnam vet marine who volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one in one thousand 
 nine hundred and seventy one he was medically retired because he had so much shrapnel in his body that he was setting off metal detectors for the next
  from nightmares  extreme anxiety in public  isolation depression 
 he self medicated with alcohol he was married and divorced three times carlos had post traumatic stress disorder  
 now i became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering 
 and for the past ten years my target has been the suffering caused by ptsd as experienced by veterans like carlos
  until recently the science of ptsd just wasn 't there  
 and so we didn 't know what to do 
 we put some veterans on heavy drugs  others we hospitalized and gave generic group therapy  and others still we simply said to them just go home and try to forget about your experiences 
 more recently we 've tried therapy dogs wilderness retreats many things which may
  temporarily relieve stress but which don 't actually eliminate ptsd symptoms over the long term  
 but things have changed  
 and i am here to tell you that we can now eliminate ptsd 
 not just manage the symptoms and in huge numbers of veterans because new scientific research has been able to show  
  which treatments actually get rid of symptoms and which do not 
 now as it turns out  the best treatments for ptsd use many of the very same training principles that the military uses in preparing its trainees for war  
 now making war
 this is something that we are good at we humans have been making war since before we were even fully human and since then we have gone from using
  stone and sinew to developing the most sophisticated and devastating weapon systems imaginable 
 and to enable our warriors to use these weapons  we employ the most cutting edge training methods we are good at making war 
 and we are good at training our warriors to fight 
 yet when we consider the experience of the modern day combat veteran we begin to see that we have not been as good
 at preparing them to come home
 why is that well our ancestors lived
 immersed in conflict  and they fought right where they lived 
 so until only very recently in our evolutionary history there was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war because we never really did 
 but thankfully today most of humanity lives in far more peaceful societies  and when there is conflict
  in the united states now have the technology to put our warriors through advanced training drop them in to fight anywhere on the globe
 and when they 're done  jet them back to peacetime suburbia  but just imagine for a moment
 what this must feel like i 've spoken with veterans who 've told me that one day they 're in a brutal firefight in afghanistan
 where they saw carnage
 and death
 and just three days later they found themselves toting an ice chest to their kid 's soccer game 
 is the most common term it 's
 the most common term i 've heard to describe that experience  and that 's exactly what that is because while our warriors spend countless hours training for war 
  we 've only recently come to understand that many require training
 on how to return to civilian life 
 now like any training the best ptsd treatments require repetition in the military  we don 't simply hand trainees 
  mark 19 automatic grenade launchers and say here 's the trigger here 's some ammo and good luck 
 no we train them 
 on the range and in specific contexts over and over and over until lifting their weapon and engaging their target is so engrained into muscle memory that it can be
  performed without even thinking even under the most stressful conditions you can imagine 
 now the same holds for training based treatments 
 the first of these treatments is cognitive therapy  and this is a kind of mental recalibration 
 when veterans come home from war their way of mentally framing the world is calibrated to an immensely more dangerous environment 
 so when you try to overlay
  overlay that mind frame onto a peacetime environment  you get problems  you begin
 drowning in worries about about dangers that aren 't present you begin not trusting family or friends 
 which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life there are it
 's just that the probability of encountering them compared to combat is astronomically lower
  so we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are 
 if you find yourself in a bad neighborhood  you turn it up 
 out to dinner with family  you turn it way down  
 we train veterans to be fiercely rational to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability of encountering
  say an ied here in peacetime america with enough practice  those  recalibrations stick 
 the next of these treatments is exposure therapy and this is a kind of field training and the fastest of the proven effective treatments out there  
 you remember carlos this was the treatment that he chose  and so we started off by giving him exercises for him
  challenging ones going to a grocery store  going to a shopping mall  going to a restaurant  sitting with his back to the door and critically
 staying in these environments 
 now at first he was very anxious he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands
  on a makeshift weapon and he wanted to leave but he didn 't 
 he remembered his training in the marine corps  and he pushed through his discomfort  
 and every time he did this his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit and then a little bit more and then a little bit more 
 until in the end  he had effectively relearned how to sit in a public space
 and just enjoy himself  he also listened to recordings of his combat experiences
  over and over and over he listened until those memories no longer generated any anxiety 
 he processed his memories so much that his brain no longer needed to return to those experiences in his sleep  
 and when i spoke with him
 a year after treatment had finished  he told me doc  this is the first time in
 that i haven 't had nightmares now this is different
 than erasing a memory 
 veterans will always remember their traumatic experiences but with enough practice those memories are no longer as raw or as painful as they once were 
 they don 't feel emotionally
  like they just happened yesterday  and that is an immensely better place to be 
 but it 's often difficult and like any training it may not work for everybody  
 and there are trust issues  sometimes i 'm asked if you haven 't been there doc how can you help me which is understandable  
 but
 at the point of returning to civilian life you do not require somebody who 's been there
  don 't require training for operations on the battlefield  you require training on how to come home
 for the past ten years of my work 
 i have been exposed to detailed accounts of the worst experiences that you can imagine daily  
 and it hasn 't always been easy there have been times where i have just felt my heart break
 or that i 've absorbed too much  but
 these training based treatments work so well that whatever this work takes out of me it puts back even more because i see people get better 
 i see people 's lives transform 
 carlos can now enjoy outings with his grandchildren which is something he couldn 't even do with his own children and what 's
  amazing to me is that after forty three years of suffering it only took him ten weeks of intense training to get his life back
 and when i spoke with him he told me  i know that i can 't get those years back  
 but at least now whatever days that i have left on this earth i can live them in peace 
 he also said
  that these younger veterans don 't wait to get the help they need and that 's my hope too because 
 this life is short and if you are fortunate enough
 to have survived war or any kind of traumatic experience you owe it to yourself to live your life well  
 and you shouldn 't wait to get the training you need to make that happen
  now the best way of ending human suffering caused by war
 is to never go to war  
 but we are just not there yet as a species until we are  the mental suffering that we create
 in our sons and in our daughters when we send them off to fight
  but we must ensure that the science the energy level the value that we place on sending them off to war
 is at the very least mirrored in how well we prepare them to come back home to us this much we owe them
