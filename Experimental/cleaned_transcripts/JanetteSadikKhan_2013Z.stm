  the work of a transportation commissioner isn 't just about stop signs and traffic signals  it involves the design of cities and the design of city streets 
 streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has and yet it 's an asset that 's largely
 hidden in plain sight  
 and the lesson from new york over the past six years is that you can update this asset you can remake your streets quickly inexpensively  it can provide immediate benefits  and it can be quite popular  
 you just need to look at them a little differently  
 this is important because we live in an urban age for the first time in
 most people live in cities and the u n estimates that over the next forty years the population is going to double on the planet  so the design of cities is a key issue for our future  
 mayor bloomberg recognized this when he launched planyc in two thousand and seven  
 the plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace  and that if we 're going to
  continue to grow and thrive
 and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure 
 for many cities our streets have been in a kind of suspended animation for generations  this is a picture of times square in the
  of the technological innovation cultural changes political changes  
 this is times square in two thousand and eight not much has changed in those fifty years 
 so we worked hard to refocus our agenda to maximize efficient mobility providing more room for buses more room for bikes
  more room for people to enjoy the city and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them 
 we set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks  having goals is important because if you 
 want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction  you need to know where you 're going and why 
  expected on it in this case  it 's expected that you shelter in place 
 the design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible from point a to point b  and it misses all the other ways that a street is used 
 when we started out we did some early surveys about how our streets were used  and we found that new york city was largely
 a city without seats
  pictures like this people perched on a fire hydrant not the mark of a world class city 
 it 's not great for parents with kids  it 's not great for seniors it 's not great for retailers  it 's probably not good for the fire hydrants  
 certainly not good for the police department  
 so we worked hard to change that
  balance  and probably the best example of our new approach is in times square 
 three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through times square  
 and people had tried for years to to make changes they changed signals they changed lanes  everything they could do to make times square work better  it was dangerous
  hard to cross the street
  it was chaotic  
 and so none of those approaches worked so we took a different approach a bigger approach  looked at our street differently  and so we did a six month pilot  we closed broadway from 42nd street to 47th street
 and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space  and the temporary
  important part of the program because we were able to show
 how it worked  and i work for a data driven mayor as you probably know  so it was all about the data  so if it worked better for traffic if it was better for mobility if it was safer better for business  we would keep it 
 and if it didn 't work no harm no foul we could put it back the way that it was because these were temporary materials and that was a very big part of the
  much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back  
 but the results were overwhelming 
 traffic moved better it was much safer  five new flagship stores opened  
 it 's been a total home run times square is now one of the top ten retail locations on the planet
  and this is an important lesson because it doesn 't need to be a zero sum game between moving traffic and creating public space
  every project has its surprises and one of the big surprises with times square was how quickly people flocked to the space
 we put out the orange barrels and people just materialized immediately into the street it was like a star trek episode you know they weren 't there before and then zzzzzt 
 all the people arrived  where
  i don 't know  but they were there  and this actually posed an immediate challenge for us because the street furniture had not yet arrived  
 so we went to a hardware store and bought hundreds of lawn chairs  
 and we put those lawn chairs out on the street and the lawn chairs became the talk of the town 
 it wasn 't about that we 'd closed broadway to cars  it was about those lawn
  what did you think about the lawn chairs do you like the color of the lawn chairs so if you 've got a big controversial project think about lawn chairs 
 this is the final design for times square  and it will create a level surface sidewalk to sidewalk  beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards creating a great new energy on the
  and we think it 's going to really create a great place a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name and we will be cutting the ribbon on this the first phase this december 
 with all of our projects our public space projects we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who
 maintain the spaces move the furniture take care of the plants
  this is in front of macy 's  and they were a big supporter of this new approach because they understood
 that more people
 on foot is better for business  
 and we 've done these projects all across the city in all kinds of neighborhoods this is in bed stuy brooklyn  and you can see the short leg that was there used for cars that 's not really needed
 so what we did is we painted over the street put down epoxy gravel and connected the triangle to the storefronts on grand avenue created a great new public space
  and it 's been great for businesses
 along grand avenue 
 we did the same thing in dumbo in brooklyn  and this is one of our first projects that we did and we took an underutilized  
 pretty dingy looking parking lot
 and
 used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend
  in the three years since we 've implemented the project  retail sales have increased one hundred and seventy two percent  
 and that 's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood  
 we 've moved very very quickly
 with paint and temporary materials instead of waiting through years of planning studies
 and computer models to get something done  we 've done it with paint and temporary materials  and the proof is not in a computer model it is in the
 real world performance of the street  you can have fun with paint 
 all told we 've created over fifty pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city  we 've repurposed
 twenty six acres of active car lanes
  and turned them into new pedestrian space
  i think one of the successes is in its emulation you 're seeing this kind of approach since we 've painted times square you 've seen this approach in boston in chicago in san francisco in mexico city buenos aires you name it this is actually
 in los angeles and they actually copied even the green dots
 that we had on the streets but i can 't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move
 over traditional construction methods
 we also brought this quick acting approach to our cycling program  and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in new york i think it 's 
  fair to say it used to be a
 fairly scary place to ride a bike
  and now new york has become one of the cycling capitals
 in the united states  
 and we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes  you can see the map in two thousand and seven this is how it looked in 
  two thousand and thirteen after we built out three hundred and fifty miles of on street bike lanes  i love this because it looks so easy you just click it 
  we also brought new designs to the street we created the first 
 bike lane in the united states we
 protected bikers by floating parking lanes  and it 's been great bike volumes have spiked injuries to all users pedestrians cyclists drivers are all down fifty percent and we 've built thirty miles of these
  protected bike lanes and now you 're seeing them pop up all over the country 
 and you can see here that this strategy has worked the blue line is the number of cyclists  soaring the
 green line is the number of bike lanes and the yellow line is the number of injuries which has remained essentially flat
  after this big expansion  you 've seen no net increase in injuries  and so there is something to that
 axiom that there is safety in numbers not everybody liked the new bike
 and there was a lawsuit and and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago one brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on prospect park west 
  the most contested piece of land outside of the gaza strip 
 and this is what we had done 
  see that the people were far ahead of the press far ahead of the
 politicians in fact i think most politicians would be happy to have those kind of poll numbers
 sixty four percent of new yorkers support these bike lanes  
 this summer  we launched citi bike the largest bike share program in the united states with six thousand bikes and three hundred and thirty stations located next to one another  
 since we 've launched the program three
  million trips have been taken people have ridden seven million miles that 's two hundred and eighty times around the globe  
 and so with this little blue key you can unlock the keys to the city
  and this brand new transportation option and daily usage just continues to soar what has happened is the average daily ridership on the streets of new
  thousand people the high that we 've had so far is forty four thousand in august  yesterday forty thousand people used citi bike in new york city  the bikes are being used six times a day 
 and i think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets in the past it looked like the guy on the left
  all getting on a bike  it 's an affordable safe convenient way to get around quite radical  
 we 've also brought this approach to our buses  and
 new york city has the largest bus fleet in north america  the slowest bus speeds  as everybody knows  you can walk across town faster than you can take the bus
  and so we focused on
 the most congested areas of new york city built out six bus rapid transit lines fifty seven miles of new speedy bus lanes  you pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus 
 we 've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane
 and it 's been a huge success i think one of my very favorite moments
 as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched citi bike  and i was riding
 citi bike up first avenue in my protected bike lane and i looked over and i saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands and the traffic was flowing 
 birds were singing 
 the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes
 it was just fantastic and this is how it looked six years ago  and so
  i think that the lesson that we have from new york is that it 's possible to change your streets quickly it 's not expensive it can provide immediate benefits  and it can be quite popular  
 you just need to reimagine your streets they 're hidden in plain sight
