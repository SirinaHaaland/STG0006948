  i 'm going to talk to you about power in this 21st century  and basically what i 'd like to tell you
 is that power is changing  and there are two types of changes i want to
  which is change of power amongst states and there the simple version of the message is it 's moving from west to east the other
 is power diffusion the way power is moving from all states west or east to non state actors  
 those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century  and i want to tell you about
  them each separately and then how they interact
 and why in the end there may be some good news 
 when we talk about power transition 
 we often talk about the rise of asia  it really should be called the recovery or return of asia if we
  you 'd find that more than half of the world 's people lived in asia
 and they made more than half the world 's product  now fast forward to one thousand nine hundred 
 half the world 's people more than half still live in asia  but they 're now making only a fifth of the world 's product  what happened  
 the industrial revolution 
 which meant
  all of a sudden europe and america became the dominant center of the world  what we 're going to see in the  21st century
 is asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world 's population and more than half of the world 's
 product that 's important and it 's an important shift but let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that i 'm
 i 'm talking about which is power diffusion to understand power diffusion
 put this in your mind  computing and communications costs have fallen
 a thousandfold between one thousand nine hundred and seventy and the beginning of this century  
 now that 's a big abstract number but to make it more real  if the price of an automobile
 had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power  you could buy a car today
  today for five dollars  now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically  
 the barriers to entry go down  anybody can play in the game  
 so in one thousand nine hundred and seventy  if you wanted to communicate from oxford to johannesburg to
 new delhi to brasilia and anywhere simultaneously
 you could do it the technology was there  but to be able to do it you had to be very rich
 a government a multinational corporation  maybe the catholic church
 but you had to be pretty wealthy  now anybody has that capacity which previously was restricted
 by price just to a few actors
  they have the price of entry into an internet cafe the last time i looked it was something like a pound an hour
 and if you have skype it 's free  so
 capabilities that were once restricted
 are now available to everyone and what that means is not that the age of the state is
  the state still matters  but the stage is crowded  
 the state 's not alone there are many many actors  some of that 's good  oxfam a great
  non governmental actor some of it 's bad al qaeda  another non governmental actor 
 but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts we think
  the government of japan attacked the united states at pearl harbor  it 's worth noticing that a 
  actor attacking the united states in two thousand and one
 killed more americans than the government of japan did in one thousand nine hundred and forty one you might think of that as the
  so we 're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power  
 now the problem is that we
 're not thinking about it in very innovative ways  so let me step back and ask what 's power 
 power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want and you can do it in three ways 
 you can do it with threats
 of coercion
 you can do it with payments carrots or you can do it by getting others to want what you want  
 and that ability to get others to want what you want to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment is what i call soft power  
 and that soft power has been much neglected
 and much misunderstood  and yet it 's tremendously
  important  indeed  if you can learn to use more soft power  you can save a lot on carrots and sticks  
 traditionally the way people thought about power
 was primarily in terms of military power  for example the great oxford historian who taught here
  defined a great power
 as a country able to prevail in war  
 but we need a new narrative if we 're to understand power in the 21st century it 's not just prevailing at war though war still persists  
 it 's not whose army wins  it 's also whose story wins  and we have to think much more in terms of narratives
 and whose narrative is going to be effective
  now let me go back to the question of power
 transition between states and what 's happening there the narratives that we use now
 tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers 
 and the current narrative is all about the rise of china and the decline of the united states
 indeed with the two thousand and eight financial
  crisis many people said this was the beginning of the end of american power the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting 
 and president medvedev of russia for example  pronounced in two thousand and eight this was the beginning of the end of united states power  
 but in fact this metaphor of decline
 is often very misleading if you look at history
 in recent history you 'll see the cycles of belief in american decline come and go every ten or fifteen years or so in 
  after the soviets put up sputnik  it was that 's the end of america in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window
  was the end of america in the 1980s as america went through a transition in the reagan period between
 the rust belt economy of the midwest to the silicon valley economy of california that was the end of america  
 but in fact what we 've seen
 is none of those were true  indeed people were
  policy adventures and now we 're back to decline again  
 the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology
 than they do about reality  if we try to focus on the reality  then what we need to focus on is what 's really happening
 in terms of china and the united states  goldman sachs
 has projected that china the chinese economy will surpass that of the u s by two
 so we 've got  what seventeen more years to go or so
 before china 's bigger now someday with a billion point three people getting richer they are going to be bigger than the united states  
 but be very careful about these projections
  such as the goldman sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture
 of power transition in this century  let me mention three reasons why it 's too simple first of all it 's a linear projection you
 know everything says  here 's the growth rate of china here 's the growth rate of the u s here it goes straight line history is
  there are often bumps along the road  accidents along the way the second thing is that
 the chinese economy passes the u s economy in let 's say two thousand and thirty  which it may
 it that will be a measure of total economic size but not of per capita income
 won 't tell you about the composition of the economy china still has large areas of underdevelopment
 and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy  and that the chinese
  won 't catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part  after two thousand and fifty of this century  the other point that 's worth noticing
 is how 
 this projection is you know 
 it looks at economic power measured by gdp  doesn 't tell you much about military power doesn 't tell you very much about soft power
  and also when we think about the rise of asia or return of asia as i
 called it a little bit earlier it 's
 worth remembering asia 's not one thing  
 if you 're sitting in japan or in new delhi or in hanoi 
 your view of the rise of china
  is a little different than if you 're sitting in beijing  indeed  one of the advantages that the americans will have in terms of power in asia
 is all those countries
 want an american insurance policy against the rise of china  it 's as though mexico
 and canada were hostile neighbors to the united states  which they 're not  so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type
 are not telling us what we need to know about power transition
  but you might ask well so what in any case why does it matter who cares is this just a game that diplomats and academics play  
 the answer is it matters quite a lot because if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this the facts not the myths  
 you may have policies which are very dangerous 
 let me give you an example from history 
  peloponnesian war was the great conflict in which the greek city state system tore itself apart
 two and a half millennia ago 
 what caused it
 thucydides the great historian of the the peloponnesian war said it was the rise in the power of athens and the fear it created in sparta  
 notice both halves of that explanation
 many people argue
 that the 21st century is going to repeat the 20th century  in which
 world war one  the great conflagration in which
 the european state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world that that was caused by the rise in the
 power of germany
 and the fear it created in britain 
 so there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today that what we 're going to see is the same thing now in this century  
 no i think that 's wrong it 's bad history for one thing germany had surpassed britain in industrial strength
 by one thousand nine hundred and as i said earlier china has not passed the united
  but also if you have this belief
 and it creates a sense of fear it leads to overreaction and the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition
 of the shift toward the east
 is fear to paraphrase franklin roosevelt from a different context the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself 
 we don 't have to fear the rise of china
 or the return of asia and if we have policies
 in which we take it in that larger historical perspective we 're going to be able to manage this process 
 let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion
 and then pull these two types together if you ask how is power distributed in the world
  top board 
 military power among states the united states is the only superpower 
 and it 's likely to remain that way for two or three decades china 's not going to replace the u s on this military board  
 middle board of this three dimensional chess game 
 economic power among
  can balance each other the bottom board of this 
 the board of transnational relations things that cross borders outside the control of governments  
 things like climate change  drug trade  financial flows  
  all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments  
 there nobody 's in charge it makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi polar power is chaotically distributed 
 and the only way you can solve these problems and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century is through cooperation 
 through working together 
 which means that soft power becomes more important that ability to organize networks to deal with
  these kinds of problems
 and to be able to get cooperation  
 another way of putting it is that as we think of power in the 21st century  we want to get away from the idea that power 's always zero sum
 my gain is your loss and vice versa power can also be positive sum where your gain can be my gain 
 if china develops greater energy security
 and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions 
 that 's good for us as well as good for china as well as good for everybody else  so empowering china to deal with its own
 problems of carbon is good for everybody and it 's not a zero sum i win
  's one in which we can all gain  
 so as we think about power in this century  
 we want to get away from this view that it 's all i win you lose  
 now i don 't mean to be pollyannaish about this  wars persist power persists military power is important  
 keeping balances is important all this still persists  hard power is there
  and it will remain 
 but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that i call smart power  you 're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we 're facing  
 so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this
 is how do we work together to produce global public goods  things from which all of us can benefit 
  how do we define our national interests so that it 's not just zero sum but positive sum 
 in that sense if we define our interests for example for the united states the way britain defined its interests in the  19th century  keeping an open trading system  
 keeping a monetary stability  keeping freedom of the seas those were good for britain they were good for others as well 
 and in the 21st century you have to do an analog to that how do we produce global public goods which are good for us
 but good for everyone at the same time and that 's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the 21st century  there are ways to define our interests
 in which while protecting ourselves with hard power we can organize with others in networks
 to produce not only public goods  but ways that will enhance our soft power
  so
 if one looks at the statements that have been made about this i am impressed that when hillary clinton described the foreign policy of the obama administration 
 she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power 
 as she put it using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box 
 and if we 're going to deal with these two
  great power shifts that i 've described 
 the power shift represented by transition among states the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states 
 we 're going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power  
 and that 's the good news i have we can do that thank you very much
