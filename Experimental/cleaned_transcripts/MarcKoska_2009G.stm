  years ago i read a newspaper article which said that
 one day
 syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of aids the transmission of aids i thought this was unacceptable so i decided to do something about it 
 sadly it 's come true  malaria as we all know
  kills approximately one million people a year the reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills
 one point three million people a year this young girl and her friend that i met in an orphanage in
 delhi were hiv positive from a syringe and what was so sad about this particular story was that
 that once their parents had found
  out and don 't forget their parents took them to the doctor
 the parents threw them out on the street  and hence they ended up in an orphanage and it comes from situations like this where
 you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners  blindly giving an injection to someone and the injection is so valuable that the people
 basically trust the doctor being second to god which i 've heard many times
  times to do the right thing but in fact they 're not  and you can understand obviously the transmission problem between
 people in  high virus areas 
 this video we took undercover  which shows you over a half an hour period a tray of medicines of forty two vials  
 which are being delivered with only two syringes in a public hospital in india 
 and over the course of half an hour not one syringe was
  filmed being unwrapped they started with two and they ended with two 
 and you 'll see just now a nurse coming back to the tray which is their sort of modular station and dropping
 the syringe she 's just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again so you can imagine the scale of this problem and in fact in india
  of all injections given are unsafe 
 these kids in pakistan don 't go to school they are lucky they already have a job and that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals wash them 
  and in the course of this obviously picking them up they injure themselves  and then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place which is quite bizarre 
  a syringe and pricked his finger i don 't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end
 and
 immediately whipped out a box of matches  lit one and burned the blood off the end of his finger giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of hiv 
 in china recycling is a major issue  and they are collected en mass you can see the scale of it here and sorted out by hand
  back into the right sizes  and then put back out on the street  
 so recycling and reuse are the major issues here but there was one interesting anecdote that i found in indonesia 
 in all schools in indonesia there is usually a toy seller in the playground the toy seller in this case had syringes which they usually
  next door to the diggers which is obviously what you would expect 
 and they use them in the breaks for water pistols they squirt them at each other which is lovely and innocent and they are having great fun but they also drink from them while they 're
 in their breaks because it 's hot  and they squirt the water into their mouths and these are used with traces of blood visible 
 so we need a better product and we need better information and i think if i can just borrow this camera 
 i was going to show you my invention
  invention which i came up with  so it 's a normal looking syringe you load it up in the normal way this is made on existing
 equipment in fourteen factories that we license 
 you give the injection and then put it down  if someone then tries to reuse it it locks and breaks afterwards it 's very very simple
  and that will stop reusing a syringe twenty or thirty times
