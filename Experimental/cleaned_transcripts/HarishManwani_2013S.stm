  model of capitalism
 and the economic model that you and i did business in and in fact continue to do business in was built around what probably milton friedman
  and adam smith of course the father of modern economics actually said
 many many years ago the invisible hand which is if you continue to operate in your own  self interest you will do the best good for society 
 now capitalism has done a lot of good things
 and i 've talked about a lot of good things that have happened  but equally it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we 've seen in society  
  that at least i was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in
 was one which talked about what i call the three g 's of growth 
 growth that is consistent  quarter on quarter growth that is competitive  better than the other person  and growth that is profitable so you continue to make more and more shareholder value  
 and i 'm afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this
 to a model of what i call
 the fourth g the g of growth that is responsible  and it is this
 that has to become a very important part of creating value of not just creating economic value
 but creating social
  and companies that will thrive
 are those that will actually embrace the fourth g and the model of 4g is quite simple 
 companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders
 in what 's happening around in society they have to begin to play their role
 in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them  and we have to move to a model of an and and model
 which is how do we make money
  do good 
 how do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us 
 and that model is all about doing well and doing good 
 but the question is easier said than done  but how do we actually get that done  and i do believe
 that the answer to that is going to be leadership it is going to be to redefine the new business models
 which understand
 that the only license to operate is to combine these things and for that you need businesses that can actually define their role
 in society
 in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell  
 and companies that actually define a true north things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good  bad  ugly doesn 't matter there are things
 that you stand for values and purpose are going to be the two
 drivers of software
 that are going to create the companies of tomorrow  and i 'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences 
 i joined unilever in one thousand nine hundred and 
  as a management trainee
 in india  and on my first day of work
 i walked in and my boss tells me do you know why you 're here i said i 'm here to sell a lot of soap 
 and he said no you 're here to change lives 
 you 're here to change lives  you know i thought it was rather facetious we are a company that sells soap and soup what are we doing about changing lives
  it 's then i realized
 that simple acts
 like selling a bar of soap
 can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies i don 't know how many of you know that five million children don 't reach the age of five
 because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap we run the largest
  we are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people it 's not about selling soap there is a larger purpose out there 
 and brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change and the reason for that is when two billion people use your brands
 that 's the amplifier small actions can make a big difference  take another example
  i was walking around in one of our villages in india  now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park  
 and
 we had this lady who was one of our small distributors
 beautiful  very very modest her home and she was out there  dressed nicely her husband in the back
  was changing because this lady is part of our project shakti
 that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene 
 we have sixty thousand such women now in india  it 's not about selling soap  
 it 's about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people 's lives
  small actions big difference  our r & d folks
 are not only working to give us some fantastic detergents  
 but they 're working to make sure we use less water 
 a product that we 've just launched recently one rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes  
 and if we can convert all our users to using this that 's five hundred billion liters of water by the
  that 's equivalent to one month of water for a for a whole huge
 continent  
 so just think about it there are small actions that can make a big difference  
 and i can go on and on our food chain our brilliant products and i 'm sorry i 'm giving you a word from the sponsors
 knorr  hellman 's and all those wonderful products we are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced
 from sustainable sources 100 percent sustainable sources  we were the first
 to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources  i don 't know how many of you know that
 palm oil  and not buying it from sustainable sources  can create deforestation that is responsible for twenty percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world  
 we were the first to embrace that 
 and it 's all because
 we market soap and soup  and the point i 'm making here
 is that companies like yours companies like mine
 have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate
