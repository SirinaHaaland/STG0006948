  the narrative of a rising africa is being challenged 
 about ten years ago i spoke about an africa 
 an africa of hope and opportunity an africa of entrepreneurs an africa very different from the africa that you normally hear about
  poverty and disease 
 and that what i spoke about became part of what is known now as the narrative of the rising africa i want to tell you two stories about this rising africa  
 the first has to do with rwanda a country that has gone through many trials and tribulations 
 and rwanda has decided to become the technology hub or a technology hub on the continent  it 's a country
  with mountainous and hilly terrain a little bit like here so it 's very difficult to deliver services to people so what has rwanda said in order to save lives it 's going to try 
  using drones to deliver lifesaving drugs vaccines and blood to people in hard to reach places in partnership with a company called zipline with
  and also with the gavi a global vaccine alliance 
 in doing this it will save lives this is part of the type of innovation we want to see in the rising africa  
 the second story has to do with something that i 'm sure most of you have seen or will remember very often countries in africa suffer drought and floods  and it 's getting more frequent because of climate change effects 
 when this happens they normally wait for international appeals to raise
  money you see pictures of children with flies on their faces  carcasses of dead animals and so on now these countries thirty two countries came together under the 
  auspices of the african union and decided to form an organization called the african risk capacity what does it do it 's a weather based insurance
  and what these countries do is to pay insurance each year about three million dollars a year of their own resources so that in the event they have
 a difficult drought situation or flood
 this money money will be paid out to them which they can then use to take care of their populations instead of waiting for aid to come 
 the african risk capacity last year paid twenty six million dollars
  take care of one point three million people affected by drought they were able to restore livelihoods  buy fodder for cattle  feed children in school and in short keep the populations
 home instead of migrating out of the area  so these are the kinds of stories of an africa ready to take responsibility for itself and to look for solutions for its own problems  
 but that narrative is being challenged
  now because the continent has not been doing well in the last two years it had been growing at five percent per annum for the last one and a half decades  but 
  this year 's forecast was three percent why in an uncertain global environment  commodity prices have fallen many of the economies are still commodity driven
  and therefore their performance has slipped  
 and now the issue of brexit doesn 't make it any easier 
 i never knew that the brexit
 could happen and that it could be one of the things that would cause global uncertainty such as we have  so now we 've got this situation  
 and i think it 's time to take stock and to say what were the things that the african countries
  what did they do wrong  how do we build on all of this and learn lessons so that we can keep africa rising 
 so let me talk about six things that i think we did right  the first is managing our economies better the 
  were the lost decades when africa was not doing well and some of you will remember
  learned that they needed to manage the macroeconomic environment better to ensure stability keep inflation low in single digits keep their fiscal deficits low below three percent of gdp  
 give investors  both domestic and foreign some stability so they 'll have confidence to invest in these economies so that was number one
  ratio of african countries was one hundred and thirty percent  
 and they didn 't have fiscal space they couldn 't use their resources to invest in their development because they were paying debt there may be some of you in this room who worked to support african countries to get debt relief  so
  and bilaterals came together and decided to do the highly indebted poor countries initiative and give debt relief  so this debt relief in two thousand and five
 made the debt to gdp ratio fall down to about thirty percent and there was enough resources to try and reinvest  the third thing was  loss making enterprises governments were involved in business which they had no business being
  and they were running businesses they were making losses so some of these enterprises were restructured  commercialized  privatized or closed and they became less of a burden on government 
 the fourth thing was a very interesting thing 
 the telecoms revolution came and african countries jumped on it in two thousand we had eleven million phone lines today  we have about
  million mobile lines on the continent  and this has enabled us to go  move forward with some mobile technology where africa is actually leading in 
  kenya  the development of mobile money m pesa which all of you have heard about it took some time for the world to notice that africa was ahead in this particular technology 
 and this mobile money is also providing a platform for access to alternative energy you know people who can now pay for
  solar the same way they pay for cards for their telephone  
 so this was a very good development something that went right  
 we also
 invested more in education and health not enough 
 but there were some improvements two hundred and fifty million children were immunized in the last one and a half decades  
 the other thing was that conflicts
  decreased there were many conflicts on the continent many of you are aware of that but they came down and our leaders even managed to dampen some coups
 new types of conflicts have emerged and i 'll refer to those later  
 so based on all this there 's also some differentiation on the continent that i want you to know about because even as the doom and gloom is here there are some countries cte d 'ivoire kenya
 tanzania and senegal are performing relatively well at the moment  
 but what did we do wrong  let me mention eight things you have to have more things wrong than right 
 so there are eight things we did wrong  the first was that even though we grew we didn 't create enough jobs we didn 't create jobs for our
  youth unemployment on the continent is about fifteen percent  and underemployment is a serious problem  the second thing that we did is that
 the quality of growth was not good enough even those jobs we created were
  jobs so we moved people from
  agriculture to 
 commerce and working in the informal sector in the urban
  we created more billionaires fifty billionaires worth ninety six billion dollars own more wealth
 than the bottom seventy five million people on the continent  
 poverty 
 the proportion of people in poverty that 's the fourth thing did decrease but the absolute numbers did not because of population growth and population
 growth is something that we don 't have enough of a dialogue about on the continent and i think we will need to get a handle on it particularly how we educate girls
  from the chinese that helped some countries but it 's not enough 
 the consumption of electricity in africa on the continent in sub saharan africa is equivalent to spain  
 the total consumption is equivalent to that of spain  so many people are living in the dark  and as the president of the african development bank said
  africa cannot develop in the dark  
 the other thing we have not done is that our economies retain the same structure that we 've had for decades  so even though we 've been growing the structure of the economies has not changed very much  
 we are still exporting commodities and exporting commodities is what it 's exporting jobs our manufacturing
  is only eleven percent we are not creating enough decent manufacturing jobs for our youth and trade among ourselves is low only about twelve percent of our trade is among ourselves  
 so that 's another serious problem  
 then governance 
 governance is a serious issue  
 we have weak institutions  and sometimes nonexistent institutions and i think this gives way for corruption corruption is an issue
  we have not yet gotten a good enough handle on and we have to fight tooth and nail that and increased transparency in the way we manage our economies and the way we manage 
 our finances  we also need to be wary of new
  we need to partner with international partners  developed countries to
 fight this together otherwise we create a new reality which is not the type we want for a rising africa and finally 
 the issue of education our education systems in many countries are broken  we are not creating the types of skills needed for the future  
 so we have to find a way to educate better
  so those are the things that we are not doing right now where do we go from there 
 i believe that the way forward is to learn to manage success 
 very often when people succeed or countries succeed they forget what made them succeed 
 learning what you 're successful at managing it and keeping it is vital for us so all those things i said we did right
  we have to learn to do it right again keep doing it right  managing the economy while creating stability is vital getting prices right  
 and policy consistency very often  we are not consistent one regime goes out another comes in and they throw away even the functioning policies that were there before what 
  does this do it creates uncertainty for people for households  uncertainties for business they don 't know
 whether and how to invest debt  we must manage the success we had in reducing our debt but now countries are back to borrowing again  and we see our 
 debt to gdp ratio beginning to creep up and in certain countries debt is becoming a problem so we have to avoid that so managing success  the next thing is focusing with a laser beam on those things we did not do well first and foremost is infrastructure yes
  countries now recognize they have to invest in this and they are trying to do the best they can to do that we must the most important thing is power you cannot develop in the 
  dark  and then governance and corruption  we have to fight we have to make our countries transparent  and above all we have to engage our young people
  we have genius in our young people i see it every day it 's what makes me wake up in the morning and feel ready to go  we have to unleash the genius of our young people get out of 
  their way support them to create and innovate and lead the way  and i know that they will lead us in the right direction  and our women  and our girls  we have to recognize that girls and women are a gift 
  unleash that strength so that they can contribute to the continent 
 i strongly believe that when we do all of these things we find that the rising africa narrative is not a fluke  
 it 's a trend  
 it 's a trend  
 and if we continue if we unleash our youth  if we unleash our women  we may step backwards sometimes  we may even step sideways  but the trend is
  will continue to rise and i tell you businesspeople in the audience investment in africa is not for today is not for tomorrow it 's not a short term thing it 's
  a longer term thing  but if you are not invested in africa then you will be missing one of the most important emerging opportunities in the world thank you
  you mentioned corruption in your talk and you 're known well known as a strong anticorruption fighter but that 's had consequences
  people have fought back and your mother was kidnapped how have you been handling this ngozi okonjo iweala 
 it 's been very difficult thank you for
 mentioning the issue of
  the kidnap of my mother it 's a very difficult
 subject  but what it means is that when you fight corruption 
 when you touch the pockets of people who are stealing money they don 't just keep quiet 
 they fight back and the issue for you is when they try to intimidate you do you give up 
 or do you fight on do you find a way to stay on and fight back  and the answer
  had with the teams i worked with
 is we have to fight on  we have to create those institutions we have to find ways to stop these people from taking away the heritage of the future  and so that 's what we did 
 and even out of government we continued to make that point 
 in our countries nobody  nobody is going to fight corruption for us but us and therefore
  that comes with consequences  and we just have to do the best we can but i thank you and thank ted for giving us a voice to say to those people you will not win  and we will not be intimidated
