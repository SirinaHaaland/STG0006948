  we made this kindergarten to be a circle  it 's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof
  if you are a parent  you know that kids
 love to keep making circles  this is how the rooftop looks and why did we design this the
 principal of this kindergarten said no i don 't want a handrail i said it 's impossible but
  how about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof  so that it can catch the children falling off 
 i said it 's impossible and of course the government official said of course you have to
 have a handrail but we could keep that idea around the trees there are three trees
  were allowed to call
 this rope
 as a handrail  but of course  rope has nothing to do with them they fall into the net  and you get more
  he loves the tree so he is eating the tree 
 and at the time of an event they sit on the edge 
 it looks so nice from underneath monkeys in the zoo
  we made the roof as low as possible  because we wanted to see children on top of the roof not only underneath the roof  
 and if the roof is too high  you see only the ceiling 
 and the leg washing place there are many kinds of water taps
  to spray water to your friends  
 and the shower  and the one in front is quite normal but if you look at this the boy is not washing his boots he 's putting water into his boots
  there is no boundary between inside and outside  so it means basically this architecture is a roof  and also there is no boundary
 between classrooms  so there is no acoustic barrier at all   when you put many children
 in a quiet
  there is no reason they get nervous because there is no boundary  and the principal says
 if the boy in the corner doesn 't want to stay in the room we let him go he will come back eventually because it 's a circle
  in that kind of occasion usually children try to hide somewhere  but here  just
 they leave and come back it 's a natural process  and
 secondly we consider noise very important  you know that
 children
  up in the jungle with noise  they need noise 
  and you know you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar 
 you are not supposed to be in silence  and you know  these days we are trying to
 make everything under control you know it 's
 completely open  and you should know that
 we can go skiing in minus twenty degrees in winter in summer
 you go
  swimming  the sand is fifty degrees 
 and also you should know that you are waterproof  you never melt
 in rain  so children are supposed to be outside  so that is how we should treat them 
 this is how they divide classrooms they are
  they talk to each other around the well  and there are always
  at least one skylight  and this is where santa claus comes down at the time of christmas
  the building
 is only five meters tall
 with seven floors  and of course the ceiling height is very low  so you have to consider safety  
 so we put our children
  he hit his head
 he 's okay his skull is quite strong he is resilient it 's my son 
 and he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off  and then we put other children
  traffic jam is awful in tokyo as you know the driver in front
 she needs to learn how to drive now
 these days  kids need a small dosage of danger  
 and in this kind of occasion
  to help each other this is society this is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days
  so it 's not exactly small at all  and this boy did six thousand meters in the morning  
 but the surprise is yet to come the
  don 't train them we leave them on top of the
  roof  just like sheep 
 they keep running 
 my
 point is don 't control them 
 don 't protect them too much  
 and they need to tumble sometimes  they need to get some injury 
 that makes them learn how to live in this world  
 i think
 architecture is capable of changing this world and people 's lives 
 and this is one of the attempts
 to change the lives  of children  thank you very much
