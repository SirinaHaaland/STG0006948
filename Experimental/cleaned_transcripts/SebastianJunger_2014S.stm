  of an uncomfortable question
  both civilians obviously and soldiers suffer in war i don 't think any civilian has ever missed the war that they were subjected to
  i 've been covering wars for almost twenty years and one of the remarkable things for me
 is how many soldiers find themselves missing it  how is it someone can
 go through the worst experience imaginable and come home back to their home and their family their country  and miss the war  how does that
  it mean 
 we have to answer that question  
 because if we don 't it 'll be impossible to bring soldiers back to a place in society where they belong  
 and i think it 'll also be impossible to stop war if we don 't understand how that mechanism works  the problem is
 that war does not have a simple neat
 truth one simple neat truth
  any sane person hates war hates the idea of war  wouldn 't want to have anything to do with it  
 doesn 't want to be near it doesn 't want to know about it 
 that 's a sane response to war  but if i asked all of you in this room who here has paid
 money
 to go to a cinema and be entertained by a hollywood war movie most of you would
  probably raise your hands that 's what 's so complicated about war  and trust me if a room full of peace loving people
 finds something compelling about war  so do 20 year old soldiers
 who have been trained in it i promise you that 's the thing that has to be understood  
 i 've covered war for about twenty years as i said but my most intense
  experiences in combat were with american soldiers
 in afghanistan  i 've been in africa the middle east afghanistan in the ' 90s
 but it was with american soldiers in two thousand and seven two thousand and eight that i was confronted with
 very intense combat i was in a small valley called the korengal valley in eastern afghanistan
  was six miles long there were one hundred and fifty men of battle company in that valley and for a while while i was there 
 almost twenty percent of all the combat in all of afghanistan was happening in those six miles a hundred and fifty men were absorbing
 almost a fifth of the combat for all of nato forces in the country for a couple months it was very intense  
 i spent most of my time at a small outpost called restrepo
  it was named after the platoon medic that had been killed about two months into the deployment  it was
 a few plywood b huts
 clinging to a side of a ridge and sandbags bunkers gun positions and
 there were twenty men up there
 of second platoon battle company  i spent most of my time up there there was no running water there was no way to bathe
  the guys were up there for a month at a time they never even got out of their clothes they fought the worked they slept
 in the same clothes they never took them off and at the end of the month they went back down to the company headquarters  and by then their clothes were unwearable they burned them and got a new set  
 there was no internet  there was no phone there was no communication with the outside world
 up there there was no cooked food
  there was nothing up there
 that young men typically like no cars no girls no television nothing
 except combat combat they did learn to like 
 i remember one day it was a very hot day in the spring  and we hadn 't
 been in a fight in a couple of weeks maybe  usually the outpost was attacked  and we hadn 't seen any combat in a couple of weeks and everyone was
 just stunned with boredom and heat  and i remember the
 the lieutenant walking past me sort of stripped to the waist it was incredibly hot stripped to the waist  walked past me muttering oh god please someone
  that 's how bored they were that 's war too is a lieutenant saying please make something happen
 because we 're going crazy to understand that you have to for a moment think about combat not morally
 that 's an important job to do but for a moment don 't think about it morally think about it
 neurologically let 's think about what happens in your brain when you 're in combat
  first of all the experience is
 very bizarre it 's a very bizarre one it 's not what i had expected 
 usually you 're not scared i 've been very scared in combat but most of the time when i was out there  
 i wasn 't scared i was very scared beforehand and incredibly scared afterwards
  and that fear that comes afterwards can last years  i haven 't been shot at in six years  and i was woken up very abruptly this morning
 by a nightmare that i was being strafed by aircraft six years later  i 've never even been strafed by aircraft  and i was having nightmares about it  
 time slows down you get this weird tunnel vision  
 you notice some details very very very accurately and other things drop out it 's almost a slightly altered state of mind
  in your brain is you you 're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline pumped through your system 
 young men will go to great lengths to have that experience  it 's wired into us it
 's hormonally supported  
 the mortality rate for young men in society is six times what it is for young women from violence and from accidents
  just the stupid stuff that young men do  jumping off of things they shouldn 't jump off of lighting things on fire they shouldn 't light on fire i mean you know what i 'm talking about 
 they die at six times the rate
 that young women do  statistically  you are safer as a teenage boy 
 you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most american cities
 than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for
  something to do  statistically  
 you can imagine how that plays out in combat at restrepo every guy up there was almost killed including me
 including my good friend tim hetherington who was later killed in libya 
 there were guys walking around walking around with bullet holes in their uniforms  rounds that had cut through the fabric
 and didn 't touch their bodies
 i was leaning against some sandbags one morning not much going on sort of spacing out 
 and some sand was kicked into the side of sort of hit the side of my face  something hit the side of my face and i didn 't know what it was  
 you have to understand about bullets that they go a lot faster than sound so if someone shoots at you from a few hundred meters  the bullet goes by you or hits you obviously
 half a second or so before the sound catches up to it so i had some sand sprayed in the side of my face 
 half a second later i heard dut dut dut dut duh it was machine gun fire it was the first round the first burst of an hour long firefight  
 what had happened was the bullet hit a bullet hit three or four inches from the side of my head  
 imagine just think about it because i certainly did
 think about the angle of deviation that saved my life at four hundred meters it missed me by three inches just think about the math on that 
 every guy
 up there had some experience like that at least once if not many times 
 the boys are up there for a year  they got back some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home
  some of them stayed in the army
 and were more or less okay  psychologically 
 i was particularly close to a guy named brendan o 'byrne i 'm still very good friends with him he came back to the states he got out of the army 
 i had a dinner party one night i invited him  
 and he started talking with a woman one
  she knew how bad it had been out there  and she said brendan is there anything at all that you miss about
 being out in afghanistan about the war and he thought about it
 quite a long time and finally he said ma 'am  i miss almost all of it 
 and he 's one of the most traumatized people i 've seen from that war ma 'am i miss almost all of it
  what is he talking about he 's not a psychopath 
 he doesn 't miss killing people he 's not crazy  he doesn 't miss getting shot at and seeing his friends get killed 
 what is it that he misses we have to answer that 
 if we 're going to stop war we have to answer that question  
 i think what he missed
  is brotherhood he missed in some ways the opposite of killing what he missed was connection
 to the other men he was with now brotherhood is different from friendship friendship happens in society obviously  
 the more you like someone the more you 'd be willing to do for them  brotherhood has nothing to do with how you feel about the other person
  it 's a mutual agreement
 in a group
 that you will put the welfare of the group you will put the safety of everyone in the group above your own in effect you 're saying 
 i love these other people more than i love myself 
 brendan was a team leader in command of three men and the worst day in
  afghanistan he was almost killed so many times it didn 't bother him the worst thing that happened to him in afghanistan was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet
 in the helmet knocked him over 
 they thought he was dead it was in the middle of a huge firefight no one could deal with it and a minute later  kyle steiner sat back up
 from the dead as it were  because he 'd come back to consciousness
  the bullet had just knocked him out it glanced off the helmet  he remembers people saying  as he was sort of half conscious he remembers 
  people saying steiner 's been hit in the head steiner 's dead and he was thinking i 'm not dead and he sat up 
 and brendan realized after that that he could not protect his men and that was the only time he cried in afghanistan was realizing that
  that 's
 brotherhood this wasn 't invented recently 
 many of you have probably read the iliad achilles surely would have risked his life or given his life to save his friend patroclus 
 in world war ii there were many stories of soldiers who were wounded 
 were brought to a rear base hospital who went awol  crawled out of windows slipped out
 doors went awol  wounded to make their way back to the front lines to rejoin their brothers out there 
 so you think about brendan  you think about all these soldiers
 having an experience like that a bond like that in a small group 
 where they loved twenty other people in some ways more than they loved themselves you think about how good
  that would feel imagine it  
 and they they are are blessed with that experience for a year  and then they come home  and they are
 just back in society
 like the rest of us are not knowing who they can count on not knowing
 who loves them who they can love not knowing exactly
  what anyone they know would do for them if it came down to it that is terrifying  
 compared to that
 war  psychologically in some ways is easy  compared to that kind of alienation that 's why they miss it  and that 's
 what we have to understand and in some ways fix in our society thank you very much
