  it was just an ordinary saturday  my dad was outside mowing the lawn  my mom was upstairs folding laundry my sister was in her room doing homework
 and i was in the basement playing video games
  and as i came upstairs to get something to drink i looked out the window and realized that there was something that i was supposed to be doing and this is what i saw
 no this wasn 't my family 's dinner on fire  this was my science project 
 flames were pouring out  smoke was in the air and it looked like our wooden deck was about to catch fire  
 i immediately started yelling my mom was freaking out my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my
  sister started recording a snapchat video 
 this was just the beginning of my team 's science project  
 my team is composed of me and three other students who are here in the audience today  
 we competed in first lego league which is an international lego robotics competition for kids  and in addition to a robotics
  we also worked on a separate science project  and this was the project that we were working on  
 so the idea for this project all started when a few months earlier a couple of my teammates took a trip to central america and saw beaches littered with styrofoam or expanded polystyrene foam 
 and when they came back and told us about it we really started thinking about the ways in which we see styrofoam every day 
 get a new  flat screen tv you end up with a block of styrofoam bigger than the tv itself
  drink a cup of coffee well those
  styrofoam coffee cups are sure going to add up  
 and where do all these items go after their one time use 
 since there aren 't any good existing solutions for used styrofoam almost all of them end up right in the landfill or the oceans and beaches  taking over five hundred years to degrade
  and in fact  every year the us alone produces over two billion pounds of styrofoam filling up a staggering
  we have these ghost accumulations of styrofoam waste why can 't we just recycle them like
 many plastics 
 well simply put recycled polystyrene is too expensive and potentially contaminated so there is very little market demand for styrofoam that has to be recycled 
 and as a result styrofoam is considered a nonrenewable material because it is neither feasible nor viable to recycle polystyrene  and in fact many cities
  across the us have even passed ordinances that simply ban the production of many products containing polystyrene which includes disposable utensils packing peanuts takeout containers 
 and even plastic beach toys all products that are very useful in today 's society  
  but what if we could keep using styrofoam
 and keep benefiting from its cheap  lightweight  insulating and excellent packing ability  while not having to suffer from the repercussions of having to dispose of it 
 what if we could turn it into something else that 's actually useful 
 what if we could make the impossible possible 
 my team hypothesized that we could use the carbon that 's already in styrofoam to create activated carbon which is used in almost every water filter today
  and activated carbon works by using very small micropores to filter out contaminants from water or even air  
 so we started out by doing a variety of heating tests 
 and unfortunately we had many failures  literally nothing worked  
 besides my dad 's grill catching on fire  most of our samples vaporized into nothing or exploded inside expensive furnaces
 a horribly sticky mess in fact  we were so saddened by our failures that we almost gave up  
 so why did we keep trying when all the adults said it was impossible well  maybe it 's because we 're kids we don 't know any better 
 but the truth is we kept trying because we thought it was still possible  we knew that if we were successful we would be helping the environment and making the world a better place 
 so we kept trying
  and failing and trying
 and failing we were so ready to give up  
 but then it happened 
 with the right temperatures times and chemicals  we finally got that successful test result showing us that we had created activated carbon from styrofoam waste  
 and at that moment the thing that had been impossible all of a sudden wasn 't 
 it showed us that although we had many failures at the beginning
 were able to persevere through them to get the test results that we wanted 
 and moreover not only were we able to create activated carbon for purifying water but we were also able to reduce styrofoam waste  solving two global problems with just one solution 
 so from then on we were inspired to take our project further  performing more tests to make it more effective and testing it
  sponsored by the us army as well as first global innovation awards sponsored by xprize 
 and we were also honored with the scientific american innovator award from google science fair
  and using these funds we plan to file a full patent on our process and to continue to work on our project  
  with catching my dad 's grill on fire and failing so many times that we almost quit it was well worth it when we look back at it now 
 we took a problem that many people said was impossible and we made it possible  and we persevered when it looked like nothing that we did would work 
 we learned that you can 't have success without a little 
 or a lot of failure  
 so in the future don 't be afraid if your grill goes up in flames because you never know when your idea might just catch fire
