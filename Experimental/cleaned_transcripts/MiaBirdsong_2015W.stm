  for the last fifty years a lot of smart well resourced people some of you no doubt
 have been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty in the united states
  people have created and invested millions of dollars into non profit organizations with the mission of helping people who are poor  
 they 've created think tanks that study issues like education job creation and 
 and then advocated for policies to support our most marginalized communities  
 they 've written books and columns and given passionate speeches decrying the wealth gap
  that is leaving more and more people entrenched at the bottom end of the income scale 
 and that effort has helped  
 but it 's not enough our poverty rates haven 't changed that much in the last fifty years  since the war on poverty was launched  
 i 'm here to tell you
 that we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource here it
 people who are poor up in the left hand corner
 is jobana sintia and bertha  they met when they all had small children through a parenting class at a family resource center in san francisco 
 as they grew together as parents and friends  they talked a lot about how hard it was to make money when your kids are little 
 child care is expensive more than they
 earn in a job their husbands worked but they wanted to contribute financially too so they hatched a plan  they started a cleaning business 
 they plastered neighborhoods with flyers and handed business cards out to their families and friends and soon they had clients calling two of them
 would clean the office or house and one
  they split the money three ways it was not a full time gig no one could watch the little ones all day  but it made a difference for their families
  extra money to pay for bills when a husband 's work hours were cut money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing 
 a little extra money in their pockets to make them feel some independence
  in the top right corner is theresa and her daughter brianna brianna is one of those kids with this sparkly  infectious  outgoing personality 
 for example when rosie a little girl who spoke only spanish moved in next door 
 brianna who spoke only english  borrowed her mother 's tablet and found a translation app so the two of them could communicate
  right  rosie 's family credits brianna with helping rosie to learn english a few years ago  
 brianna started to struggle academically she was
 growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn and acting out in class and her mother was heartbroken over what was
  then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade and brianna was devastated her mother felt hopeless and
 overwhelmed and alone
 because she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed and she did not know how to help her 
 one afternoon theresa was catching up with a group of friends and one of them said theresa how are you 
 and she burst into tears 
 after she shared her story one of her
  friends said 
 i went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago and in that moment theresa realized that so much of her struggle was not having anybody to talk with about it 
 so she created a support group for parents like her 
 the first meeting was her and two other people but word spread and soon twenty people thirty people were showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together
  she went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle and brianna is doing fantastic she 's doing great academically and socially 
 that in the middle
 is my man baakir standing in front of blackstar books and caffe which he runs out of part of his house as you walk in the door
  baakir greets you with a welcome black home 
 once inside you can order some algiers jerk chicken  perhaps a vegan walnut burger or jive turkey sammich 
 and that 's sammich not sandwich
  must finish your meal with a buttermilk drop  which is several steps above a donut hole and made from a very secret family recipe 
 for real it 's very secret he won 't tell you about it 
 but blackstar is much more than a caf 
 for the kids in the neighborhood it 's a place to go after school to get help with homework 
 for the grown ups it 's where they go to find out what 's going on in the neighborhood and catch up with friends  it 's a performance venue it 's a home for poets musicians and artists
 baakir and his partner nicole with their baby girl strapped to her back are there in the mix of it all serving up a cup of coffee  
 teaching a child how to play mancala  or painting a sign for an upcoming community event  
 i have worked with and learned from people just like them for more than twenty years  i have organized against the prison system  
 which impacts poor folks
 especially black indigenous and latino folks at an alarming rate  
 i have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise despite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools and police violence in their communities  
 i have learned from families who are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity
 to collectively create their own solutions and they 're not just focused on money
 they 're addressing education  housing  health community the things that we all care about  
 everywhere i go i see people who are broke but not broken 
 i see people who are struggling to realize their good ideas  so that they can create a better life for themselves their
  are the rule not the shiny exception  i am the exception  
 i was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in rochester new york 
 i was bussed to a school in the suburbs from a neighborhood that many of my classmates and their parents considered
  at eight i was a latchkey kid  i 'd get myself home after school every day and
 do homework and chores and wait for my mother to come home 
 after school i 'd go to the corner store and buy a can of chef boyardee ravioli  which i 'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack 
 if i had a little extra money i 'd buy a hostess fruit pie 
 laughter cherry not as good as a buttermilk drop
  we were poor when i was a kid  but now i own a home in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood in oakland california  
 i 've built a career my husband is a business owner  
 i have a retirement account  
 my daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove unless there 's a grown up at home and she doesn 't have to because she does not have to have the same kind of self reliance that i had to at her age my kids ' raviolis are organic and full of things
  like spinach and ricotta because i have the luxury of choice when it comes to what my children eat  i am the exception 
 not because i 'm more talented than  baakir or my mother worked any harder than jobana sintia or bertha  or cared any more than theresa 
 marginalized communities are full
  talented people hustling and working and innovating just like our most revered and most rewarded ceos  
 they are full of people tapping into their resilience to get up every day get the kids off to school and go to jobs that don 't pay enough  or get educations that are putting them in debt  
 they are full of people
 applying their savvy intelligence to stretch a minimum wage paycheck or balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet
  full of people doing for themselves and for others whether it 's
 picking up medication for an elderly neighbor  or letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill 
 or just watching out for the neighborhood kids from the front stoop  
 i am the exception because of luck and privilege not hard work and i 'm not being modest or
  people work hard 
 hard work is the is the common denominator in this equation and i 'm tired of the story we tell that hard work leads to success 
 because that allows thank you 
 because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it and by implication those who
  don 't make it don 't deserve it 
 we tell ourselves in the back of our minds and sometimes in the front of our mouths there must be something a little wrong with those poor people 
 we have a wide range of beliefs about what that something wrong is 
 some people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders who would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day 's work 
 others prefer the story that poor people are helpless and probably had neglectful
  parents that didn 't read to them enough and if they were just told what to do and shown the right path they could make it for every story
 i hear
 demonizing low income single mothers or absentee fathers which is how people might think of my parents i 've got fifty
 that tell a different story about the same people showing up every day and doing their best
 i 'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren 't true 
 but those stories allow us to not really see who people really are because they don 't paint a full picture 
 the quarter truths and limited plot lines have us convinced that poor people are a problem that needs fixing 
 what if we recognized that what 's working is
  the people and what 's broken is our approach what if we realized that the experts we are looking for the experts we need to follow are poor people themselves 
 what if instead of imposing solutions we just added
 fire to the already burning flame that they have not directing
 not even empowering but just fueling their
  initiative 
 just north of here we have an example of what this could look like silicon valley 
 a whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief that if people have good ideas
 and the desire to manifest them  we should give them lots and lots and
  but where is our strategy for theresa and baakir 
 there are no incubators for them no accelerators  no fellowships 
 how are jobana sintia and bertha really all that different from the mark zuckerbergs of the world
 baakir has experience and a track record i 'd put my money on him 
 so
  consider this an invitation
 to rethink a flawed strategy  let 's grasp this opportunity
 to let go of a tired faulty narrative
 and listen and look for true stories more beautifully complex stories about who marginalized people
 and families and communities are i 'm going
 to take a minute to speak to my people
 we cannot wait for somebody else to get it right  
 let us remember what we are capable of 
 all that we have built with blood sweat and dreams all the cogs that keep turning and the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work 
 let us remember that we are magic
 if you need some inspiration to jog your memory  
 read octavia butler 's parable of the sower 
 listen to reverend king 's letter from birmingham jail listen to suheir hammad recite first writing since or esperanza spalding perform black gold 
 set your gaze upon the art of kehinde
  at the hands of your grandmother
 or into the eyes of someone who loves you  
 we are magic  individually we don 't have a lot of wealth and power but
 collectively we are unstoppable and we spend a lot of our time and energy organizing
  our power to demand change from systems that were not made for us  
 instead of trying to alter the fabric of existing ways  let 's weave and cut some fierce new cloth  
 let 's use some of our substantial collective power
 toward inventing and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us desmond tutu
 talks about
  in the context of south africa 's truth and reconciliation process that they embarked on after apartheid  he says it means 
 my humanity is caught up is inextricably bound up in yours  we belong
 to a bundle of life 
 a bundle of life the truth and reconciliation process started by elevating the voices
  voices of the unheard  if this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all
 then we need to elevate the voices of our unheard of people like
  sintia and bertha  theresa and baakir we must leverage their solutions and their
  we must listen to their true stories their more beautifully complex stories  thank you
