  my subject today is learning and in that spirit i want to spring on you all a pop quiz  ready 
 when does learning begin  now as you ponder that question
  're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher 
 or maybe you 've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork  
 maybe you 've encountered the zero to three movement which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones  
 and so your answer to my question would be learning begins at birth  
 well today i want to
  present to you an idea that may be surprising
 and may even seem implausible  but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology  
 and that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we 're born  while we 're still in the womb  
 now i 'm a science reporter i write books and magazine articles and i 'm also a mother
 and those two roles came together for me in a book that i wrote called origins 
 origins is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins 
 fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago  
 and it 's based on the theory that our health and well being throughout our lives
  lives
 is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb  
 now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me i was myself pregnant while i was doing the research for the book 
 and one of the most fascinating insights i took from this work
 is that we 're all learning about the world even before we enter it when we hold our
  babies for the first time we might imagine that they 're clean slates  unmarked by life 
 when in fact they 've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in 
 today i want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they 're still in their mothers ' bellies 
 first of all
  learn the sound of their mothers ' voices 
 because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother 's abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus  
 the voices fetuses hear  starting around the fourth month of gestation are muted and muffled
  one researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of charlie brown 's teacher in the old peanuts cartoon  
 but the pregnant woman 's own voice reverberates through her body  reaching the fetus much more readily  
 and because the fetus is with her all the time  it hears her voice a lot 
 once the baby 's born it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else 's how
  we know this newborn babies can 't do much but one thing they 're really good at is sucking 
 researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples 
 so that if a baby sucks on one it hears a recording of its mother 's voice on a pair of headphones and if it sucks on the other
  it hears a recording of a female stranger 's voice 
 babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one  scientists also take advantage of the fact
 that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them
 and resume their fast sucking when they get bored
  this is how researchers discovered that after women repeatedly read aloud a section of
  hat while they were pregnant their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it it outside the womb  my favorite experiment of this kind
 is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy
 recognized the theme song of that of that show once they were
  learning about the particular language that 's spoken in the world that they 'll be born into a study published last year
 found that from birth from the moment of birth  babies cry in the accent of their mother 's native language 
 french babies cry on a rising note while
  german babies end on a falling note imitating the melodic contours of those languages  
 now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful 
 it may have evolved to aid the baby 's survival  
 from the moment of birth the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it its mother  
 it even makes its cries sound like the mother 's
  which may further endear the baby to the mother  and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language  
 but it 's not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero it 's also tastes and smells 
 by seven months of gestation the fetus ' taste buds are fully developed  and its olfactory
  which allow it to smell are functioning  
 the flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid  which is continuously swallowed by the fetus  
 babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they 're out in the world 
 in one experiment a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy while another group of pregnant women drank only water
 six months later the women 's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice  and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it 
 the offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot flavored cereal and from the looks of it they seemed to enjoy it more 
 a sort of french version of this experiment was carried out in dijon france
 where researchers
  found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with
 anise
 during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life  and again when they were tested later on their fourth day of life 
 babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy
 showed a reaction that translated roughly as
  what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat 
 fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they 'll be joining
 through one of culture 's most powerful expressions which is food 
 they 're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture 's cuisine even before birth
  turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons but before i get to that i want to address something that you may be wondering about 
 the notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus like playing mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly  
 but actually the 
 process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral
  and consequential than that much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life
 the air she breathes the food and drink she consumes 
 the chemicals she 's exposed to even the emotions she feels are shared in some fashion with her fetus 
 they make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself 
  fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body  makes them part of its flesh and blood 
 and often it does something more it treats these maternal contributions as information as what i like to call biological postcards from the world outside 
 so what a fetus is learning about in utero is not mozart 's magic flute but answers to questions much
 more critical to its survival  will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity 
 will it be safe and protected or will it face constant dangers and threats 
 will it live a long fruitful life or a short harried one  
 the pregnant woman 's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted
  to the wind  the resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus ' brain and other organs
 are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility our ability to thrive
 in a huge variety of environments from the country to the city from the tundra to the desert 
 to conclude i want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world
 even before they 're born 
 in the autumn of one thousand nine hundred and forty four the darkest days of world war ii 
 german troops blockaded western holland 
 turning away all shipments of food  
 the opening of the nazi 's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades so cold the water in the canals froze solid 
 soon food became
  scarce with many dutch surviving on just five hundred calories a day a quarter of what they consumed before the war 
 as weeks of deprivation stretched into months some resorted to eating tulip bulbs 
 by the beginning of may the nation 's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted the specter
  the siege came to a sudden end when holland
 was liberated by the allies 
 the hunger winter as it came to be known  killed some ten thousand people and weakened thousands more  
 but there was another population that was affected the forty thousand fetuses in utero during the siege
  the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths birth defects  low birth weights and infant mortality  
 but others wouldn 't be discovered for many years 
 decades after the hunger winter researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege
 have more obesity more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions
 these individuals ' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways 
 they have higher blood pressure  poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance a precursor of diabetes 
 why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later one explanation is that fetuses are making the best of
  a bad situation when food is scarce they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ the brain and away from other organs like the heart and liver 
 this keeps the fetus alive in the short term 
 but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs deprived early on become more susceptible to
  but that may not be all that 's going on it seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment
 and tailoring their physiology accordingly  they 're preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb  
 the fetus adjusts its metabolism
 and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it and the basis of the fetus ' prediction
 is what its mother eats
 the meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation 
 this story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems
 an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival  faced with severely limited resources
 a smaller sized child with reduced energy requirements will in fact have a better chance of living to adulthood  
 the real trouble comes when pregnant women are in a sense  unreliable narrators  when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty 
 this is what happened to the children of the dutch hunger winter and their higher rates of obesity
  diabetes and heart disease are the result 
 bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post war western diet 
 the world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born  
 here 's another story
  two thousand and one  there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the world trade center in new york
 commuters spilling off trains  waitresses setting tables for the morning rush  brokers already working the phones on wall street 
 one thousand seven hundred of these people were pregnant women 
 when the planes struck and the towers collapsed many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted
  on other survivors of the disaster
 the overwhelming chaos and confusion 
 the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris the heart pounding fear for their lives 
 about a year after nine eleven researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world trade center attack 
 in the babies of those women who developed
 or ptsd  following their ordeal  researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to ptsd an effect that was most pronounced
 in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester in other words  the mothers with post traumatic stress syndrome
 had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their
  while they were still in utero  
 now consider this post traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong  
 causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering  but there 's another way of thinking about ptsd 
 what looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances in a particularly
  environment the characteristic manifestations of ptsd a
 of one 's surroundings a quick trigger response to danger
 could save someone 's life the notion that the prenatal transmission of ptsd risk is adaptive
 is still speculative but i find it rather poignant  it would mean that even before birth
 are warning their children that it 's a wild world out there telling them be careful 
 let me be clear fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy it
 's about discovering how best to promote the health and well being of the next generation 
 that important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they
  in the womb learning is one of life 's most essential activities  and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined  thank you
