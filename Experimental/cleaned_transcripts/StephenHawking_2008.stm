  bigger or older than the universe  
 the questions i would like to talk about are 
  where did we come from how did the universe come into being 
 are we alone in the universe  is there alien life out there 
 what is the future of the human race  up until the 
 everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging
  it was discovered that the universe was expanding  distant galaxies were moving away from us 
 this meant they must have been closer together in the past  
 if we extrapolate back  we find we must have all been on top of each other about fifteen billion years ago  
 this was the big bang the beginning of the universe
 but was there anything before the big bang  
 if not  what created the universe  
 why did the universe emerge from the big bang the way it did 
 we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts 
 first there were the laws like maxwell 's equations and general relativity
 that determined the evolution of the universe  given its state over all of space at one time 
 and second there was no question of the initial state of the universe  
 we have made good progress on the first part and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions  but until recently
  recently  we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe  
 however  this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct  
 under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space
 this removes the distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state 
 the universe can spontaneously create itself out of
  we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states 
 these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the wmap satellite of the cosmic microwave background which is an imprint of the very early universe  
 we think we have solved the mystery of creation  
 maybe we
  should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence  
 i now turn to the second big question 
 are we alone or is there other life in the universe  
 we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life
  to appear on other suitable planets of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy  
 but we don 't know how life first appeared 
 we have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing 
 the first is that we have fossils of algae
  from three point five billion years ago 
 the earth was formed four point six billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years
 so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short
  compared to the 
  10 billion year lifetime of a planet of earth type  
 this suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high  
 if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available 
 on the other
  we don 't seem to have been visited by aliens 
 i am discounting the reports of ufos  
 why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos  
 if there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly
  despite an extensive search by the seti project  we haven 't heard any alien television quiz shows
  this probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years  
 issuing an insurance policy
  against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet  
 this brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race  
 if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy  we should make sure we survive and
  but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history 
 our population and our use of the finite resources of planet earth are growing exponentially  along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill
  our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past  
 it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years  let alone the next thousand or million 
 our only chance of
 long term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet earth  but to spread out into space 
 the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years  
 but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years  our future is in space
 that is why i am in favor of manned or should i say personned space flight 
 all of my life i have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions 
 i have been very lucky that my disability has not been a
  serious handicap  indeed  it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge 
 the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress
  if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are
 alone in the milky way  as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher
  this answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible
 act of generosity this whole talk was for ted
  think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years  
 otherwise we would have heard radio waves 
 the alternative is that civilizations
  professor hawking thank you for that answer  we will take it as a salutary warning i think for the rest of our conference this week  
 professor  we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today  thank you very much indeed
