  worst form of human rights violation
  like to tell you the story
 of these three children  pranitha  shaheen and anjali pranitha 's mother
 was a woman in prostitution  a prostituted person she got infected with hiv  and towards the end of her life 
  when she was in the final stages of aids she could not prostitute 
 so she sold four year old pranitha to a broker  
 by the time we got the information  we reached there pranitha was already raped by three men  
 shaheen 's background i don 't even know we found her in a railway track raped by
  many many men  i don 't know many  but the indications of that on her body was
 that her intestine was outside her body  
 and when we took her to the hospital she needed thirty two stitches to put back her intestine into her body  
 we still don 't know who her parents are 
 who she is all that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally
  anjali 's father a drunkard sold his child
 for pornography you 're seeing here images of three years
 and five year old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation 
  in this country  and across the globe hundreds and thousands of children as young as three as young as four 
 are sold into sexual slavery  
 but that 's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for  they are sold in the name of adoption  they are sold in the name of organ trade  they are sold in the name of forced labor  camel jockeying  anything everything
  i work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation and i tell you stories from there my own journey to work with these children
 started as a teenager  i was fifteen when i was gang raped by eight men  
 i don 't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part
  there were eight men who defiled me raped me  but that didn 't go into my consciousness i never felt like a victim then or now 
 but what lingered from then till now i am forty today
 is this huge outrageous anger two years  i was ostracized  i was stigmatized  i
  because i was a victim  
 and that 's what we do to all traffic survivors 
 we as a society  we have phds in victimizing a victim  
 right from the age of fifteen when i started looking around me  i started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children
 who are left in
  because we don 't allow them to come in where does their journey begin  
 most of them come from very optionless families not just poor you have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked  
 i had this i s officer 's daughter who is
  raped chatting with one individual  
 and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine  who was trafficked  i have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very
  into prostitution  some pay the price for it  they 're killed  we don 't even hear about them  
 they are voiceless 
 nameless people  
 but the rest who succumb into it  go through everyday torture  
 because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends
  or who want to have a family with you these are men who buy you for an hour for a day and use you throw you
 each of the girls that i have rescued i have rescued more than three thousand two hundred girls each of them tell me one story
  one man taking a cigarette and burning her one man whipping her we are living among those men they 're our brothers  fathers  uncles cousins all around us  and we are silent about them  
 we think it is easy money  we think it is shortcut  we think the person likes to do what she
  but the extra bonuses that she gets
 is various infections  sexually transmitted infections hiv aids syphilis gonorrhea you name it  substance abuse drugs  everything under the sun  
 and one day she gives up on you and me  because we have no options for her  
 and therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation  she believes yes this is it this is what my destiny is about 
 and this is normal to get raped by
  hundred men a day  and it 's abnormal to live in live in a shelter it 's abnormal
 to get rehabilitated it 's in that context that i work it 's in that context that i rescue children 
 i 've rescued children as young as three years  and i 've rescued women as old as forty years  
  when i rescued them one of the biggest challenges i had was where do i begin  because
 i had lots of them
 who were already hiv infected one third of the people i rescue are hiv positive  
 and therefore my challenge was to
 understand how can i get out the power from this pain
  and for me  i was my greatest experience
  my own self  understanding my own pain my own
 isolation was my greatest teacher  
 because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential 
 you see a girl here who is trained as a welder 
 she works
 for a very big company a workshop in hyderabad  making furnitures she earns around twelve thousand rupees 
 she is an illiterate girl 
 trained  skilled as a welder  why welding and why not
 computers  we felt  one of the things that these girls had
 is
 immense amount of courage they did not have any
 pardas inside their body  hijabs inside themselves they 've crossed the barrier of it  
 and therefore they could fight in a  male dominated world very easily  and not feel very shy about it  
 we have trained girls as carpenters as masons
  as security guards as cab drivers  and each one of them are excelling
 in their chosen field  
 gaining confidence  restoring dignity  and building hopes in their own lives these girls
 are also working in big construction companies
  what has been my challenge my challenge
 has not been the traffickers who beat me up i 've been beaten up more than fourteen times in my life
 i can 't hear from my right ear  
 i 've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue my biggest challenge
  is society  it 's you and me 
 my biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own 
 a very
 supportive friend of mine a well wisher of mine 
 used to give me every month two thousand rupees for vegetables when her mother fell sick
 she said
  so much of contacts can you get somebody in my house to work so that she can look after my mother 
 and there is a long pause  and then she says not one of our girls it
 's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking in this fantastic a c hall it 's very nice
  making films and everything  but it is not nice
 to bring them to our homes it 's not nice to give them employment
 in our factories our companies it 's not nice for our children to study with their children 
 there it ends that 's my biggest challenge if i 'm here today i 'm here not only as sunitha
  as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking  
 they need your compassion  
 they need your empathy  they need much more than anything else your acceptance 
 many times when i talk to people 
 i keep telling them one thing don 't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem 
 can you ply your mind for that one way
  that you can respond to the problem  
 and that 's what i 'm here for asking for your support  demanding for your support  requesting for your support  
 can you break your culture of silence can you speak to at least two persons about this story tell them this story  convince
  to tell the story to another two persons
