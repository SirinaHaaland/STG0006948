  his inaugural address barack obama appealed
 to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis  
 but what did he appeal to he did not happily  follow in the footsteps of
  his predecessor  and tell us to just go shopping  
 nor did he tell us trust us trust your country  invest  invest  invest 
 instead what he told us was to put aside childish things 
 and he appealed
  it seems a little out of place
 in a cutting edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean 
 let me begin with an example
 this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up
  all of the items on it are unremarkable they 're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them  empty the trash 
 restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it 's not surprising what they are 
 but the one thing i want you to notice about them is this 
 even though this is a very long list there isn 't a single thing on it that involves other human beings
  not one 
 the janitor 's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital  
 and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because
  jones was out of his bed
 getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall  
 and charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor 's admonition and didn 't vacuum the visitor 's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap 
 and then there was luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man 's room twice
 because the man 's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months didn 't see luke do it the first time and his father was angry  
 and behavior like this from janitors from technicians  from nurses and if we 're lucky now and then from doctors doesn 't just make people feel a little
  it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well  
 now not all janitors are like this 
 of course  but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the 
  job  and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings 
 will to do right by other people 
 and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom aristotle told us 
  is the combination of moral will and moral skill 
  as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as luke did when he re washed the floor
 real world problems are often ambiguous and  ill defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page  but dancing around
  them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand 
 a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people 
 and finally  perhaps most important a wise
 wise person is made not born 
 wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you 're serving 
 you need permission to be allowed to improvise try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures 
 and you need to be mentored by wise teachers  
 when you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones i described how hard it is to learn to do
  their job they tell you that it takes lots of experience  and they don 't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans 
 it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people 
 at ted  brilliance is rampant  it 's scary 
  you a little story it 's a story about lemonade 
 a dad and his seven year old son were watching a detroit tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it 
 all they had was mike 's hard lemonade which was five percent alcohol 
  being an academic had no idea that mike 's hard lemonade
 contained alcohol  so he brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance that rushed to the 
 ballpark  whisked the kid to the hospital the emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood 
  but not so fast the wayne county child
 welfare protection agency said no and the child was sent to a foster home for three days 
 at that point 
 can the child go home well a judge said yes  but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel  
 after two weeks i 'm happy to report the family was reunited
  but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure 
 how do things like this happen  
 scott simon who told this story on npr said rules and procedures may be dumb  but they spare you from thinking
 and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough 
 when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them 
 one tool we reach for is
  better ones more of them 
 the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else  after all is there 
 we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis  regulate regulate regulate  fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives  the truth 
  is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule
 that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic it 's preposterous on its face 
 and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run  but they create a downward
 downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run 
 moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations 
 and moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing 
  we are engaging in a war on wisdom let me just give you a few examples first of rules and the war on moral skill  the lemonade story is one 
 second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern american education scripted
 curricula here 's an example from chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with
  rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say
 items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book 
 all over chicago in every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day  
 we know why these scripts are there we don 't trust the judgment of
  teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster 
 and they prevent disaster  
 but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don 't
 get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need
  some notes most of them need some notes on the page  we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising 
  and as a result they lose their gifts  or worse they stop playing altogether  
  for doing the same thing  it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you 're more likely to do it right 
 well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting and they make people less likely to do it i 'll just give you one example because time is racing 
 in switzerland back
  years ago they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community 
 astonishingly fifty percent of the citizens said yes  
 they knew it was dangerous
  they thought it would reduce their property values but
 it had to go somewhere
 and they had responsibilities as citizens 
 the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks ' salary every year would you be willing to have 
  a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it 's my responsibility and i 'm getting paid 
 what happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking what is my responsibility all we ask is what serves my interests 
 when incentives don 't work  when ceos ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains that will lead to massive bonuses
  same get smarter incentives  
 the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will  
 we need incentives people have to make a living  but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity
 in two senses of that word 
 it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality  
 barack obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just ' is it profitable ' but ' is it right ' 
 and when professions are
 demoralized everyone in them
  becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine
  obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work  so what can we do a few sources of hope  we ought to try to 
 work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses 
  there is no better way to show people that you 're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course 
 what to do instead one  celebrate moral exemplars  
 acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about atticus
  goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions people are inspired by moral heroes  but we learn that with sophistication comes
 the understanding that you can 't acknowledge that you have moral heroes  well acknowledge them be proud that you have them  celebrate them and demand that the people who teach 
  you acknowledge them and celebrate them too that 's one thing we can do 
 i don 't know how many of
  you remember this another moral hero  fifteen years ago aaron feuerstein who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts they made polartec the factory burned down three thousand employees he kept every one of them on the payroll  
 why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them
  maybe on paper our company is worth less to wall street but i can tell you it 's worth more we 're doing fine just at this ted we heard
 talks from several moral heroes two were particularly inspiring to me one was ray anderson who turned
  it was the right thing to do  and a bonus he 's discovering is he 's actually going to make even more money 
 his employees are inspired by the effort  why  because there happy to be doing something that 's the right thing to do  yesterday we heard willie smits talk about
 it took the will to do the right thing god knows it took a huge amount of technical skill  
 i 'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order
  to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the
  are behind you this will fail and there isn 't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives 
 in different ways so there 's a lot here at ted  and at other places to celebrate and you don 't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes  ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too 
 ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture
 both moral skill and moral will 
 even the wisest and most well meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work  if you run an organization you should be sure that none
 of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work 
 and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom 
 and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes
  moral exemplars to the people we mentor  
 and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always 
 on bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the
  and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that kipp is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college 
 i want to focus on one particular thing kipp is doing that bill didn 't mention that is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character  
 they need to learn to respect themselves  they need to learn to respect their
  schoolmates  they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning 
 that 's the principle objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill and the teachers  the way you teach these things to the kids 
 is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day  obama appealed
  to virtue and i think he was right 
 and the virtue i think we need above all others is practical wisdom because it 's what allows other virtues honesty kindness  courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way 
 he also appealed to hope right
  i think there is reason for hope  i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous 
 in many ways  it 's what ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons 
 this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention 
 paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly
  to the structure of the organizations within which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than rather than having it suppressed  thank you very much
