  year here at ted i asked you to give me your data to put your data on the web on the basis that if people put data onto the web
 government data scientific data  community data  whatever it is it will be used by other people to do wonderful things in ways that they never
  imagined  so today i 'm back just to show you a few things to show you in fact there is an open data
 movement
 afoot now around the world the cry of raw data now which i made people make in the auditorium was heard around the world so let 's
 roll the
  classic story the first one which lots of people picked up was when in march on march 10th in fact soon after ted
 paul clarke in the u k government  blogged oh i 've just got some raw data here it is it 's about bicycle accidents 
 two days it took the times online to make a map a mashable map we call these things mash ups a  mashed up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work
 was affected here 's more data traffic survey
  data again put out by the u k government and because they put it up using the linked data standards then a user could just make a map just by clicking does
 this data affect things well let 's get back to two thousand and eight look at zanesville ohio here 's a map a lawyer made he put on it the water plant and which houses are there which houses 
 have been connected to the water  and he got from other data sources information to show which
 houses are occupied by white people 
 well  there was too much of a correlation he felt between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water and the judge was not impressed either the judge was not impressed to the tune of ten 
 point nine million dollars that 's the power of taking one piece of data  another piece of data putting it together  
  completely independent site where does my money go it allows anybody to go there and burrow down you can burrow down by a particular type of spending or you can go through all the different regions 
 and compare them  so that 's happening in the u k with u k government data  yes  certainly you can do it over here here 's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in
  take an arbitrary example long beach california you can go and have a look at what recovery money they 've been spending
 on different things such as energy in fact  this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data gov and 
  and i 'm delighted to see a great competition between the u k in blue and the u s in red how can you use this stuff  well for example if you have lots of data about places
  you can take from a postcode which is like a zip plus four for a specific group of houses you can make paper print off a paper which has got very very specific things about the bus stops the things specifically near you on a
 larger scale  this is a mash up of the data which was released about the afghan elections it allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at the red circles are polling stations
  selected by your criteria and then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors like the threat level  so  
 that was government data  i also talked about community generated data in fact i edited some this is the wiki map this is the open street map terrace theater i actually put on the map because it wasn 't on the map before ted last 
  year i was not the only person editing the open street map  each flash on this visualization put together by ito world shows an edit in two thousand and nine made to the open street map let 's now
  spin the world during the same year  every flash is an edit somebody somewhere looking at the open street map and realizing it could be better you can see europe is ablaze
 with updates some places perhaps not as much as they should be here focusing in on haiti the map of port au prince at the end of two thousand and nine was not all it could be 
 not as good as the map of california fortunately 
 just after the earthquake
 commercial company released satellite imagery with a license which allowed the open source community to use it 
 this is january in time lapse of people editing that 's the earthquake after the earthquake immediately people all over the world mappers who wanted to help and could 
 looked at that imagery  built the map quickly building it up we 're
  refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [ satellite images ] so now we have immediately a real time map showing where there are refugee camps rapidly became the best map to use if you 're doing relief work in port au prince witness the fact that it 's here on this garmin device being used by rescue team
 in haiti there 's the map showing on the left hand side that hospital actually that 's a hospital ship
  that shows blocked roads  damaged buildings refugee camps it shows things that are needed
