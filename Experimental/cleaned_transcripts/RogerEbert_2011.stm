  these are my words but this is not my voice  this is alex the best computer voice i 've been able to find which comes as standard equipment on every macintosh  
 for most of my life i never gave a second thought to my ability to speak  it was like breathing in those days
  i was living in a fool 's paradise  after surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak  eat or drink i was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me  
 for several days now we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at ted i used to be able to talk like that 
  maybe i wasn 't as smart  but i was at least as talkative  
 i want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself  and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one 's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away  
 however i 've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous  so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me i will start with my wife chaz
 it was chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak  
 going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in two thousand and six 
 i expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show ' ebert and roeper at the movies
 i had pre taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation  
 the doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw 
 my tongue  larynx and vocal cords were still
  i was optimistic and all was right with the world 
 the first surgery was a great success i saw myself in the mirror and i looked pretty good 
 two weeks later  i was ready to return home
  home  i was using my ipod to play the leonard cohen song ' i 'm your man ' for my doctors and nurses  
 suddenly i had an episode of catastrophic bleeding 
 my carotid artery had ruptured 
 thank god i was still in my hospital room and my
 doctors were right there 
 chaz told me that if that song hadn 't played for so long i might have already been in the car on the way home  and would have died right there and then 
 so thank you leonard cohen for saving my life 
 there was a second surgery which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart 
  then a third attempt  which also patched me back together pretty well  until it failed 
 a doctor from brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture  
 and before i left the hospital after a year of
  i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery 
 there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again  it just sort of became obvious 
 human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system
  we need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds 
 therefore  the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air  
 because i had lost my jaw  i could no longer form a seal  and therefore my tongue
 and all of my other vocal equipment
  i wrote messages in notebooks then i tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice  this was faster and nobody had to try to read my handwriting  
 i tried out various computer voices that were available online and for several months i had a british accent  which chaz called sir lawrence 
 it was the clearest i could find then apple released the alex voice which was the best i 'd heard
 it knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark when it saw a period it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air  
 there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices and i 've experimented with them for me they share a fundamental problem they 're too
  when i find myself in a conversational situation  i need to type fast and to jump right
 in people don 't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase  
 but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice  how does that affect who you are as a person 
 when people hear alex speaking my words do they experience a disconnect does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next  
 how did i feel not being able to speak
  i felt  and i still feel a lot of distance from the human mainstream 
 i 've become uncomfortable when i 'm separated from my laptop even then i 'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties 
 so chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my tv show voice from a period of thirty years
  at first i was against it i thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer
  there was something comforting about a voice that was not my own  
 but i decided then to just give it a try  so we contacted a company in scotland that created personalized computer voices they
 'd never made one from  previously recorded materials all of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth  but they were willing to give it a
  so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice  including several audio commentary tracks that i 'd made for movies on dvds  
 and it sounded like me it really did there was a reason for that it was me  
 but it wasn 't that simple  
 the tapes from my tv show weren 't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved movie soundtracks for example or gene siskel arguing with me 
 and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn 't fit into a sentence
  well enough i 'll let you hear a sample of that voice  these are a few of the comments i recorded for use when chaz and i appeared on the oprah winfrey program  
 and here 's the voice we call roger jr or roger two point zero roger two point zero 
 oprah  i can 't tell you how great it is to be back on your show 
 we have been talking for a long time and now here we are again this is the
  first version of my computer voice  it still needs improvement  but at least it sounds like me
 and not like hal nine thousand  when i heard it the first time it sent chills down my spine  
 when i type anything this voice will speak whatever i type when i read something 
 it will read in my voice i have typed these words in advance as
 i didn 't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing the voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc
  it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while i was commenting on casablanca 
 and citizen kane this is the first voice they 've created for an individual there are several very good voices available for
  computers  but they all sound like somebody else  
 while this voice sounds like me i plan to use it on television radio and the internet 
 people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built in speaking systems 
 many blind people use them to read pages on the web to themselves  
 but i 've got to say in first grade
  said i talked too much and now i still can roger ebert 
 as you can hear it sounds like me  but the words jump up and down the flow isn 't natural  the good people in scotland are still improving my voice  and i 'm optimistic about it 
 but so far  the apple alex voice is the best one i 've heard  i wrote a blog about it and actually got
  a comment from the actor who played alex 
 he said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice a very large sample is needed john hunter 
 all my life i was a motormouth
  now i have spoken my last words and i don 't even remember for sure what they were 
 i feel like the hero of that harlan ellison story titled i have no
  mouth and i must scream on wednesday  david christian explained to us what a tiny instant
 the human race represents in the time span of the universe for almost all of its millions and billions of years  there was no life on earth at all 
 for almost all the years of life on earth there was no intelligent life only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next
  did civilization become possible in cosmological terms that was about ten minutes ago  
 finally came mankind 's most advanced and mysterious tool the computer 
 that has mostly happened in my lifetime 
 some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of urbana  the birthplace of hal nine thousand
  i heard the amazing talk by salman khan on wednesday about the khan academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world  i had a flashback  
 it was about one thousand nine hundred and sixty 
 as a local newspaper reporter still in high school i was sent over to the computer lab of the university of illinois to interview the creators of something called plato 
 the initials stood for
  programmed logic for automated teaching operations this was a computer assisted instruction system  
 which in those days ran on a computer named illiac  
 the programmers said it could assist students in their learning  i doubt on that day fifty years ago  they even dreamed of what salman khan has
  but that 's not the point 
 the point is plato was only fifty years ago an instant in time 
 it continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers  until only five years ago  
 i have learned from wikipedia that starting with that humble beginning  plato established forums  message boards  online
  since the first web browser was also developed in urbana  
 it appears that my hometown in downstate illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual online universe we occupy today  
 but i 'm not here from the chamber of
  i 'm here as a man who wants to communicate all of this has happened in my lifetime  i started writing on a computer back in the 
 when one of the first atech systems was installed at the chicago 
 i was in line at radio shack to buy one of the first model one hundred 's and when i told the people in the press room at the academy awards
  they 'd better install some phone lines for internet connections  they didn 't know what i was talking about 
 when i bought my first desktop it was a dec rainbow  does anybody remember that 
 the sun times sent me to the cannes film festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase
 named the porteram telebubble  i joined compuserve when it had fewer numbers than i currently have followers on twitter
 has happened in the blink of an eye  it is unimaginable what will happen next  
 it makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history  
 indeed  i am lucky to live in history at all because without intelligence and memory there is no history
  for billions of years the universe evolved completely without notice 
 now we live in the age of the internet which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness 
 and because of it  i can communicate as well as i ever could 
 we are born into a box of time and space we use words and communication
  to break out of it and to reach out to others for me the internet began as a useful tool
 and now has become something i rely on for my actual daily existence  
 i cannot speak  i can only type so fast computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated
  but with my computer  i can communicate more widely than ever before 
 i feel as if my blog my email  twitter and facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation 
 they aren 't an improvement  but they 're the best i
  they give me a way to speak not everybody
 has the patience of my wife chaz
  but online everybody speaks at the same speed  
 this whole adventure has been a learning experience 
 every time there was a surgery that failed  i was left with a little less flesh and bone now i have no jaw left at all
  harvesting tissue from both my shoulders the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily  
 ironic that my legs are fine  and it 's my shoulders that slow up my walk 
 when you see me today  i look like the phantom of the opera  but no you don 't
  it is human nature to look at someone like me and assume i have lost some of my marbles people
  people talk loudly and slowly to me  sometimes they assume i am deaf  there are people who don 't want to make eye contact
  believe me he didn 't mean this as anyway let me just read it 
 you should never let your wife read something like this it
 is human nature to look
  don 't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality that 's why writing on the internet has become a lifesaver for me 
 my ability to think and write have not been affected  and on the web my real voice finds expression  
 i have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way 
 one of my twitter friends can type only with his toes one of the
  funniest blogs on the web is written by a friend of mine named smartass cripple 
 google him and he will make you laugh
  all of these people are saying in one way or another that what you see is not all you get 
 so i have not come here to complain  i have much to make me happy and relieved i seem  for the time being
 i am writing as well as ever i am productive 
 if i were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago  i would be as isolated as a hermit  
 i would be trapped inside my head 
 because of the rush of human knowledge because of
  i have a voice  and i do not need to scream re 
 wait  i have one more thing to add 
 a guy goes into a psychiatrist  the psychiatrist says you 're crazy the guy says i want a second opinion the psychiatrist says 
 all right you 're ugly 
 you all know the test for artificial
  intelligence
 the turing test  a human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer if the judge can 't tell the machine apart from the human the machine has passed the test  
 i now propose a test for computer voices the ebert test  if a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as
 well as henny youngman then that 's the voice i want
