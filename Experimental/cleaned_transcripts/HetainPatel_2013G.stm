  working with i have asked her to translate for me
  england but i 'm not going to say it in english to you
 because i 'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent
  mandarin is i can only speak this paragraph which i have learned by heart when i was visiting in china 
 so all i can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won 't notice
  needless to say  i would like to apologize to any mandarin speakers in the audience as
 a child i would hate being made to wear the indian kurta pajama  
 because i didn 't think it was very cool it felt a bit girly to me like a
 baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down 
 my dad never wore it so i didn 't see why i had to 
 also  it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable that people assume i represent something genuinely indian when i wear it 
 because that 's not how i feel
  the only way i feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like li mu bai from that film
  okay
  is about identity and language 
 challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we
  come from gender  race class  what makes us who we are anyway
  like water 
 now you put water into a cup  it becomes the cup 
 you put water into a bottle  it becomes the bottle put it in a teapot  it becomes the teapot  now water can
  the same age bruce lee was when he died  
 i have been wondering recently if he were alive today what advice he would give me about making this
 ted talk
  i still think that we learn who we are by copying others 
 who here hasn 't imitated their childhood hero in the playground or mum or father 
 i have hp 
 a few years ago in order to make this
  video for my artwork  i shaved off all my hair so that i could grow it back as my father had it
 when he first emigrated from india to the  u k in the 1960s he had a side parting and a neat mustache  
 at first it was going very well  i even started to get discounts in indian shops
 but then very quickly i started to underestimate my mustache growing ability and
 it got way too big  it didn 't look indian anymore  instead people from across the road they would shout things like
  even have an indian accent anymore he talks like this now
  so it 's not just my father that i 've imitated a few years ago i went to china for a few months  and
 i couldn 't speak chinese  and this this frustrated me  so i wrote about this and had it
  i learned this by heart like music i guess yr 
 this phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card  
 so i can pretend i speak chinese fluently when i
 had learned this phrase i had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded  i spoke the phrase and then he
  laughed and told me oh yeah  that 's great only it kind of sounds like a woman
  so this imitation business does come with risk it doesn 't always go as you plan it even with a talented
 translator but
  i am going to stick with it because
 contrary to what we might usually assume imitating somebody can reveal something unique  so
 every time i fail to become more like my father  i become more like myself 
 every time i fail to become bruce lee  i become more authentically me 
 this is my art i
 i strive for authenticity even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect 
 it 's only recently that i 've started to understand that
 i didn 't learn to sit like this through being indian i learned this
