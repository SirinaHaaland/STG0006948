  today 's top chef class is in how to rob a bank and it 's clear that the general public needs guidance 
 because the average bank robbery nets only seven thousand five hundred dollars rank amateurs who know nothing about how to cook the books
 the folks who know of course run our largest banks and in the last go around they cost us over eleven trillion 
 dollars that 's what eleven trillion looks like that 's how many zeros and cost us over ten million jobs as well  
  intensifying financial crises and how we can prevent them in the future 
 and the answer to that is that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud  
 control fraud is what happens when the people who control typically a ceo a seemingly legitimate entity use it as a weapon to defraud and these are the weapons of mass
  destruction in the financial world 
 they also follow in finance a particular strategy  because the weapon of choice in finance is accounting 
 and there is a recipe for accounting
 control fraud and how it occurs  and we discovered this recipe in quite an odd way that i 'll come back to in a moment first ingredient in the recipe
  grow like crazy  second 
 by making or buying really crappy loans  but loans that are made at a very high interest rate or yield 
 three while employing extreme leverage that just means a lot of debt compared to your equity and four  while providing only trivial loss reserves against the inevitable losses 
 if you follow those four
  simple steps and any bank can follow them then you are mathematically guaranteed to have three things occur 
 the first thing is you will report record bank profits
 not just high record 
 two the ceo will immediately be made incredibly wealthy by modern executive compensation and three
  farther down the road  the bank will suffer catastrophic losses and will fail unless it is bailed out and 
 that 's a hint as to how we discovered this recipe because we discovered it through an autopsy process  
 during the savings and loan debacle in
  and we looked for common characteristics  and we discovered this recipe was common to each of these frauds 
 in other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe that will destroy the banks as well as the economy  
 and it also turns out to be precisely what could have stopped this crisis  the one that cost
  us eleven trillion dollars just in the household sector that cost us ten million jobs was the easiest financial crisis by far to have avoided 
 completely if we had simply learned the lessons of epidemics of control fraud  particularly using this recipe  
  and the two huge epidemics of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis
 appraisal fraud and liar 's loans and what we 're going to see in looking at both of these is
 we got warnings that were incredibly early about these frauds  
 we got warnings that we could have taken advantage of easily  because back in the savings and loan debacle
  we had figured out how to respond and prevent these crises 
 and three the warnings were unambiguous  they were obvious that what was going on was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up 
 let 's take appraisal fraud first this is simply where you inflate the value of the home that is being pledged as security for the loan 
  the year two thousand that is over a year before enron fails by the way the honest appraisers got together a formal petition
 begging the federal government to act and the industry to act to stop
 this epidemic of appraisal fraud 
 and the appraisers explained how it was occurring  that banks were demanding that appraisers inflate the appraisal
  and that if the appraisers refused to do so they the banks would blacklist
 honest appraisers
 and refuse to use them  
 now  
 we 've seen this before in the savings and loan debacle and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders and that no honest lender would ever inflate the appraisal
  because it 's the great protection against loss so this was an incredibly early warning two thousand 
 it was something we 'd seen before and it was completely unambiguous this was an epidemic of accounting control fraud led by the banks what about liar 's loans  well that warning actually
  and in the midst of fighting that wave of accounting control fraud in one thousand 
 nine hundred and ninety we found that a second front of fraud was being started and like all good financial frauds in america  it began in orange county california
  and we happened to be the regional regulators for it and our examiners said  they are making loans without even checking what the borrower 's income
  is this is insane  it has to lead to massive losses and it only makes sense for entities engaged in these accounting control frauds  and we said yeah you 're absolutely right  and we drove
  but we could only deal with the industry we had jurisdiction over which was savings and loans and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds  long beach 
  savings voluntarily gave up its federal savings and loan charter gave up federal deposit insurance  converted to become a mortgage bank for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction and changed
  its name to ameriquest and became the most notorious of the liar 's loans frauds early on and to add to that they deliberately predated upon
 minorities  so we knew again about
 this crisis we 'd seen it before  we 'd stopped
  we had incredibly early warnings of it  and it was absolutely unambiguous that no honest lender would make loans in this fashion so let 's take a look 
 at the reaction of the industry and the regulators and the prosecutors to these clear early warnings that could have prevented the crisis  
  thousand and six by increasing liar 's loans by over five hundred percent 
 these were the loans that hyperinflated the bubble and produced the economic crisis 
 by two thousand and six half of all the loans called subprime were also liar 's loans they 're not mutually exclusive
 it 's just that together they 're the most toxic combination you can possibly imagine 
 by two thousand and six  forty percent of all the loans made that year all the home loans made that year were liar 's loans  
 forty percent  and this is despite a warning from the industry 's own antifraud experts
 that said that these loans were
  open invitation to fraudsters  and that they had a fraud incidence of ninety percent  nine zero 
 in response to that the industry first started calling these loans liar 's loans  
 which lacks a certain subtlety  
 and second massively increased them
  no government regulator ever required or encouraged
 any lender to make a liar 's loan or anyone to purchase a liar 's loan and that explicitly includes fannie and freddie 
 this came from the lenders because of the fraud recipe 
 what happened to appraisal fraud it expanded remarkably as well
  two thousand and seven when a survey of appraisers was done ninety percent of appraisers reported that they had been subject to coercion from the lenders 
 trying to get them to inflate an appraisal  in other words both forms of fraud became absolutely endemic and normal  and this is what drove the bubble what happened in the governmental sector 
  the government as i told you 
 when we were the savings and loan regulators we could only deal with our industry and if people gave up their federal deposit insurance we couldn 't do anything to them  
 congress it
 may strike you as impossible but actually did something intelligent in 
 and passed the home
  equity protection act that gave the fed  and only the federal reserve  the explicit statutory authority to ban liar 's loans by every 
 lender whether or not they had federal deposit insurance  so what did ben bernanke and alan greenspan as chairs of the fed do when they got these warnings that these were massively fraudulent loans
 once it starts out a fraudulent loan it can only be sold to the secondary market through more frauds
  lying about the reps and warrantees and then those people are going to produce mortgage backed securities and exotic derivatives which are also going to be
 supposedly backed by those fraudulent loans so the fraud is going to progress through the entire
  produce a disaster  and remember we had experience with this we had seen significant losses and we had experience
 of competent regulators in stopping it 
 greenspan and bernanke refused to use the authority under the statute to stop liar 's loans 
 and this was a matter first of dogma  they 're just
 horrifically opposed to anything regulatory but it is
  also the international competition in laxity  the race to the bottom between the united states and the united kingdom the city of london 
 in particular and the city of london won that race to the bottom but it meant that all regulation in the west was completely degraded in this stupid competition to be who could have the weakest regulation so that was the
  regulatory response what about the response of the prosecutors after the crisis  after eleven trillion dollars in losses  
 after ten million jobs lost a crisis in which the losses and the frauds were more than seventy times larger than the
 savings and loan debacle 
 well in the savings and loan debacle our agency that regulated savings and loans  ots made over thirty thousand criminal referrals  
 produced over one thousand felony convictions just in cases designated as major  and that understates the degree of prioritization because we worked with 
  the fbi to create the list of the top one hundred fraud schemes the absolute worst of the worst nationwide
  three hundred savings and loans involved  roughly six hundred senior officials
  virtually all of them were prosecuted  we had a ninety percent conviction rate it 's the greatest success against elite
 white collar criminals ever  and it was because of this understanding of control fraud and the accounting control
  flash forward to the current crisis  
 the same agency office of thrift supervision which was supposed to regulate many of the largest makers of liar 's loans in the country
 has made even today it
 no longer exists but
 as of a year ago  it had made zero criminal referrals  
 the office of the comptroller of the currency which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks has made zero criminal referrals
  the fed appears to have made zero criminal referrals  the federal deposit insurance corporation is smart enough to refuse to answer the question 
 without any guidance from the regulators
 there 's no expertise in the fbi to investigate complex
  it isn 't simply that they 've had to reinvent the wheel of how to do these prosecutions  they 've forgotten that the wheel exists  
 and therefore we have zero
 prosecutions  and of course zero convictions of any of the elite
 bank frauds the wall street types that drove this crisis  
 with no expertise coming from the regulators the fbi formed what it calls
  a partnership with the mortgage bankers association
 in two thousand and seven the mortgage bankers association is the trade association of the perps  
 and the mortgage bankers association set out it had the audacity
 and the success to con the fbi  it had created a supposed definition of mortgage fraud  in which guess what
  members are always the victim and never the perpetrators  
 and the fbi has bought this hook line sinker rod reel and the boat they rode out in and so the 
 under the leadership of an attorney general who is  african american and a president
  have adopted the tea party definition of the crisis in which it is the first virgin crisis in history conceived without sin in the executive ranks  
 and it 's those oh so clever hairdressers who were able to defraud the poor pitiful banks who lack any financial sophistication it is the silliest 
 story you can conceive of and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers 
 the banksters alone entirely and so  while lions are roaming the campsite the fbi is chasing mice 
 what do we need to do what can we do in all of this we need to change the perverse incentive structures that produce 
  these recurrent epidemics of accounting control fraud that are driving our crises  
 get rid of the systemically dangerous institutions these are the 
 institutions we need to shrink them to the point within the next five years that they no longer pose a systemic risk right now they are ticking time bombs
  that will cause a global crisis as soon as the next one fails not if when 
  completely reform modern executive and professional compensation 
 which is what they use to suborn the appraisers remember they were pressuring the appraisers through the compensation system trying to produce what we call a gresham 's dynamic 
  in which bad ethics drives good ethics out of the marketplace  and they largely
  which is how the fraud became endemic and the third thing that we need to do is deal with what we call the three d 's deregulation
 and the de facto decriminalization 
 because we can make all three of these changes  and if we do so we can dramatically reduce
 how often we have a crisis
 and how severe those crises are that
  is not simply critical to our economy you can see what these crises do to inequality and what they do to our democracy  
 they have produced crony capitalism american style in which the largest financial institutions are the leading financial donors of both parties  
  seventy times larger than the savings and loan crisis  we have no meaningful reforms in any of the three areas that i 've talked about 
 other than banning liar 's loans which is good  but that 's just one form of ammunition for this fraud weapon there are many forms of ammunition they can use 
 that 's why we need to learn what the
  bankers have learned 
 the recipe for the best way to rob a bank so that we can stop that recipe  because our legislators 
 who are dependent on political contributions will not do it on their own  thank you very much
