  and i don 't use botox as yet so i 'm clean but i do behave like you saw like
 i do that i sell dreams  and i peddle love to millions of people back home in india who assume that i 'm the best lover in the world 
 if you don 't tell anyone i 'm going to tell you i 'm not but i never let that assumption go away 
 i 've also been made to understand there are lots of you here who haven 't seen my work  and i feel really sad for you
 that doesn 't take away from the fact that i 'm completely  self obsessed as a movie star should be 
 that 's when my my friends  chris and juliet called me here to speak about the future you naturally it follows i 'm going to speak about the present me
  believe that humanity is a lot like me 
 it is it is it 's an aging movie star
  grappling with all the newness around itself  wondering whether it got it right in the first place and still trying to find a way
 to keep on shining regardless  i was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of
  my father was a freedom fighter my mother was well just a fighter like mothers are
  and much like the original homo sapiens we struggled to survive 
 when i was in my early 20s i lost both my parents 
 which i must admit seems a bit careless of me now but 
  i do remember the night my father died and i remember the the driver of a neighbor who was driving us
 to the hospital  he mumbled something about dead people don 't tip so well and walked away into the dark  
 and i was only fourteen then and i put my father 's dead body in the back seat of the car  and my mother besides me i started driving back from the hospital to the house  
  and in the middle of her quiet crying my mother looked at me and she said son when did you learn to drive 
 and i thought about it and realized  and i said to my mom just now  mom 
 so from that night onwards much akin to humanity in its adolescence 
 i learned the crude tools of survival 
 and the framework of life was very
  you just ate what you got and did whatever you were told to do i thought
 celiac was a vegetable  and
 vegan of course was mr spock 's lost comrade in star trek you married the first girl
 that you dated and you were a techie
 if you could fix the carburetor in your car  i really thought that gay was a sophisticated english word for happy  and lesbian of course was the
  capital of portugal as you all know where was i 
 we relied on systems
 created through the toil and sacrifice of generations before to protect us  and we felt
 that governments actually worked for our betterment science was simple and
  apple was still then just a fruit owned by eve first and then newton not by steve jobs until then 
  what you screamed when you wanted to
 run naked on the streets you went wherever life took you for work  and people were mostly welcoming of you  migration
 was a term then still reserved for siberian cranes not human beings  most importantly you were who you were and you said what you thought
  then in my late 20s i shifted to the sprawling metropolis of mumbai  
 and my framework like the newly industrialized aspirational humanity began to alter 
 in the urban rush for a new more embellished survival  things started to look a little different i met people who had descended from all over the world
  became more and more fluid work began to define you at that time
 in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me almost too thick
 to hold on
 to the diversity of mankind and the human need to progress and grow ideas were flowing with more freedom
 and speed  and i experienced
 the miracle of human innovation and cooperation  and my own creativity  when supported
 by the resourcefulness of this collective endeavor  catapulted me into superstardom  
 i started to feel that i had arrived  and generally by the time i was forty i was really really flying  i was all over the place you know i 'd done fifty films by then
 and two hundred songs and i 'd been knighted by the
  malaysians i had been given the highest civil honor
 by the french government  the title of which for the life of me i can 't pronounce even until now laughter
 i 'm sorry france and thank you france for doing that
 but much bigger than that i got to meet angelina jolie 
 for two and a half seconds and i 'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere
  and i sat next to hannah montana on a round dinner table with her back towards me most of the time like i said i was flying from miley to jolie 
 and humanity was soaring with me  we were both pretty much flying off the handle actually and then you all know what happened  the internet happened 
 i was in my late 40s and i started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage
 and assuming that you know people who peered into my world would admire it
 for the miracle i believed it to be  but something else awaited me and humanity you know we had expected an expansion of ideas
 and dreams
 with the enhanced connectivity of the world  we had not bargained for
 the
  thought of judgment of definition that flowed from the same place
 that freedom and revolution was taking place in everything i said took a new meaning everything i did good bad ugly
 was there for the world to comment upon and judge as a matter of fact everything i didn 't say or do also
 met with the same fate four years ago
 my lovely wife gauri and me decided to have a third child  it was claimed on the net
 that he was the love child
 of our first child who was fifteen years old  apparently he had sown his wild oats with a girl
 while driving her car in romania and yeah there was a fake video to go with it and we were so disturbed as a
  family my son who is nineteen now even now when you say hello to him he just turns around and says but bro i didn 't even have a european driving license 
 in this new world  slowly reality became virtual and virtual became real  and i started to feel
 that i could not be who i wanted to be or say what i actually thought  and humanity at this time
  completely identified with me  i think both of us were going through our midlife crisis  
 and humanity like me was becoming an overexposed prima donna  i started to sell everything from hair oil
 to diesel generators humanity was buying everything from crude oil to nuclear reactors  you know
  i even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit
 to reinvent myself  i must admit i failed miserably  and just an aside i want to say on behalf of all the 
 and supermen of the world  you have to commend commend them because it really hurts in the crotch that superhero suit 
 yeah i 'm being honest i need to tell you this here
  i happened to even invent a new dance form
 which i didn 't realize and it became a rage  so if it 's all right  and you 've seen a bit of me so i 'm quite shameless  i 'll show you it was called the lungi dance  
 so if it 's all right i 'll just show you i 'm talented otherwise so
 it went something like this lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance 
  like you notice nobody could make any sense of what was happening except me  and i didn 't give a damn really because the whole world  
 and whole humanity seemed as confused and lost as i was 
 i didn 't give up then  i even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media like everyone
  i thought if i put on philosophical tweets out there people will think i 'm with it but some of the responses i got from those tweets
 were extremely confusing acronyms which i didn 't understand 
 adidas somebody wrote back to one of my more  thought provoking tweets
 and i was wondering why would you name a sneaker i mean why would you write back the name of a sneaker to me  and i asked my 16 year old daughter and she enlightened me
  know if you know that so i wrote back wtf in bold to mr adidas  thanking
 secretly that some acronyms and things won 't change at all wtf  
 but here we are i am fifty one years old like i told you
  want to tell you if there has been a momentous time for humanity to exist it is now  because the present you is brave 
 the present you is hopeful  the present you
 is innovative and resourceful and of course the present you is annoyingly indefinable  and in this
 imperfect moment of existence  feeling a little brave just before i came here
 i decided to take a good hard look at my face  and i realized
 that i 'm beginning to look more and more like the wax statue of me at madame tussaud 's 
 yeah and in that moment of realization i asked the most central and pertinent question to humanity and me 
  i 'm an actor like i told you a modern expression
 of human creativity  the land i come from is the source of inexplicable
 but very simple spirituality in its immense generosity india decided
 somehow that i the muslim son of a broke freedom fighter who accidentally ventured into the
 business of selling dreams  should become
 its king of romance 
 the badhshah of bollywood the greatest lover the country has ever seen 
 with this face yeah 
 laughter which has alternately been described as ugly
  the people of this ancient land embraced me in their limitless love and i 've learned from these people
 that neither power nor poverty
 can make your life more magical or less tortuous  i 've learned from the people of my country
 that the dignity of a life a human being a culture a religion
 a country actually resides in its ability
 for grace and compassion i 've learned
 that whatever moves you  
 whatever urges you to create 
 to build whatever keeps you from failing whatever helps you survive is perhaps the oldest and the simplest emotion known
  and that is love a mystic poet from my land famously wrote
  actually saying that all the books of knowledge that you might read and then
 go ahead and impart your knowledge through innovation through creativity  through technology  
 but mankind will never be the wiser about its future unless
 it is coupled with a sense of love and compassion for their fellow beings the two and a half alphabets which form the word
  able to understand that and practice it that itself is enough to enlighten mankind  so i truly believe the future you 
 has to be a you that loves otherwise it will cease to flourish
  it will perish in its own self absorption 
  so you may use your power
 to build walls
 and keep people outside  or you may use it to break barriers and welcome them in you may use your faith
 to make people afraid
 and terrify them into submission  or you can use it to give courage to people
 so they rise to the greatest heights of enlightenment you can use your energy
 to build nuclear bombs and spread the darkness
  of destruction or you can use it to spread the joy of light
 to millions you may filthy up the oceans callously and cut down all the forests you can destroy the
 ecology or turn to them with love
 and regenerate life from the waters and trees you may land on mars and build armed
  or you may look for life forms and species to learn from and respect and you can use all the moneys we all have earned
 to wage futile wars
 and give guns in the hands of little children to kill each other with  or you can use it
 to make more food to fill their stomachs
  my country has taught me the capacity for a human being to love is akin to godliness 
 it shines forth
 in a world which civilization  i think already has tampered too much with 
 in the last few days the talks here the wonderful people coming and showing their talent  
 talking about individual achievements the innovation the technology the sciences the knowledge we are gaining
  being here in the presence of ted talks and all of you are reasons enough for us to celebrate the future us but within that celebration
 the quest to cultivate our capacity for love and compassion
 has to assert itself has to assert itself just as equally  so i believe
 the future you is an infinite you
  you it 's called a chakra in india like a circle  it ends where it begins from to complete itself 
 a you that perceives
 time and space differently understands both
 your your unimaginable
  in the larger context of the universe a you that returns back
 to the original innocence of humanity which loves from the purity of heart which sees from the eyes of
 like an aging movie star
 who has been made to believe that there is a possibility of a world which is completely  wholly
 in love with itself a world really  it has to be a you to create a world which is its
