  talk about a very fundamental change that is going on
 in the very fabric of the modern economy  and to talk about that i 'm going to go back to the beginning because in the beginning were commodities 
 commodities are things that you grow in the ground raise on the ground or pull out of the ground basically animal mineral
  and then you extract them out of the ground and sell them on the open marketplace commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia  
 but then along came the industrial revolution  
 and then goods became the predominant economic offering  where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods
  we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy well what then happened over the last fifty or sixty years is that goods have become commoditized commoditized 
 where they 're treated like a commodity where people don 't care who makes them 
 they just care about three things and three things only price  price and price  
 now there 's an antidote to commoditization  and that is customization  my first book was called
  came up a couple of times yesterday and how i discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good
 automatically turned it into a service  because it was done just for a particular person because it wasn 't inventoried it was delivered on demand to that individual person so we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy but
 over the past ten or twenty years what 's happened is that services are being commoditized as well
  restaurants with all their value pricing  and even the internet is commoditizing not just goods but services
 as well
 what that means is that it 's time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services 
 and use in that same heuristic what happens when you customize a service what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person that 's exactly what they need at this moment in time then you can 't help but make them go
  you can 't help but turn it into a memorable event you can 't help but turn it into an experience 
 so we 're shifting to an experience economy where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering  
 now most places that i talk to when i talk about experience i talk about disney
 the world 's premier experience stager i talk about theme restaurants and experiential retail and boutique hotels and las vegas the experience capital of the world
 but here when you think about experiences think about thomas dolby and his group playing music think about meaningful places 
 think about drinking wine 
 about a journey
 to the clock of the long now those are all experiences think about ted itself the experience capital in the world of
  of conferences 
 all of these are experiences  
 now over the last several years i spent a lot of time in europe and particularly in the netherlands and whenever i talk about the experience economy there i 'm always greeted at the end with one particular question 
 almost invariably  and the question isn 't really so much a question as an accusation  and the dutch when they usually put it
 it always starts with the same two words you know the words i mean
  they say you americans  you like your fantasy environments your fake your disneyland experiences they say we dutch  
 we like real natural authentic experiences 
 so much has that happened that i 've developed a fairly praticed response  which is  
 i point out that first of all you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience 
 why because the experience happens
  inside of us it 's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us so as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings then every experience we have is authentic now
 there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience but even that is a matter of degree not kind  
 and there 's no such thing as a one hundred percent
 natural experience even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods  there is a company that manufactured the car
  delivered you to the edge of the woods there 's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods  there 's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods 
 right all of those are 
 artificiality brought into the woods by you and by the very nature of being there  and then i always
  the thing that amazes me the most about this question particularly coming from the dutch  is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland 
 laughter and the dutch they always go 
 and they realize i 'm right  there isn 't a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn 't been reclaimed from the sea or otherwise moved modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there it
 's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up
 but nonetheless not just the dutch but everyone has this desire for the authentic and authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility
 the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who are they going to buy from and what they 're going to buy becoming the basis of
  you can look at how each of these economies developed that each one has their own business imperative  
 matched with a consumer sensibility we 're the agrarian economy and we 're supplying commodities  it 's about supply and availability  getting the commodities to market 
 with the industrial economy it is about controlling costs
 getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses with the service economy it
  that has the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past twenty or thirty years  and now  with the experience economy  it 's about rendering
 authenticity  rendering authenticity and the keyword is rendering right 
 rendering because you have to get your consumers as business people to percieve your offerings as authentic  because there is a basic
  no one can have an inauthentic experience  but no business can supply one 
 because all businesses are man made objects all business is involved with money all business is a matter of using machinery  
 and all those things make something
 so how do you render authenticity is the question are you rendering authenticity
  when you think about that let me go back to what lionel trilling in his seminal book on authenticity sincerity and authenticity came out in one thousand nine hundred and sixty points to as the seminal point
 at which authenticity entered the lexicon if you will and that is to no surprise in shakespeare 
 and in his play hamlet  and there is one part in this play hamlet where the most fake of all the characters in hamlet polonius says something profoundly real 
 at the end of a laundry list
  of advice he 's giving to his son laertes he says this 
 and this above all to thine own self be true  
 and it doth follow as night the day that thou canst not then be false to any man 
 and those three verses are the core of authenticity  there are two
  you think about that you do in fact get a two by two where on one dimension it 's a matter of being true to
  as businesses are the economic offerings you are providing are they true to themselves  and the other dimension dimension is are they what they say they are to others  
 if not 
 you have is not true to itself and is not what it says it is
 yielding a two by two matrix and of course if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are then you 're real real 
 the opposite of course is fake fake
 all right now there is value for fake there will always be companies around to supply the fake because there will always be desire for the fake  
 fact is there 's a general rule if you don 't like it it 's fake  
 if you do like it it 's faux 
 now the other two sides of the
  a real fake
 is what it says it is but is not true to itself or being a fake real  
 is true to itself but not what it says it is 
 you can think about those two you know both of these better than being fake fake not quite as good as being real real  you can contrast them by thinking about
 universal city walk versus disney world or disneyland universal city walk is a real fake in fact we got this very term from ada louise huxtable 's book
  america a wonderful book where she talks about universal city walk as you know she decries the fake but she says at least that 's a real fake right because you can see behind the facade
 right it is what it says it is it 's universal studio  it 's in the city of los angeles you 're going to walk a lot 
 right you don 't tend to walk a lot in los angeles well here 's a place where you are going to walk a lot outside in this city
  but
 is it really true to itself
  is it really in the city is it
 you can see behind all of it and see what is going on in the facades of it so she calls it a real fake  
 disney world on the other hand is a fake real or a fake reality 
 right it 's not what it says it is it 's not really the magic kingdom 
  but it is oh i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to we won 't talk about santa claus then 
 but disney world is wonderfully true to itself  right just wonderfully true to itself when you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment 
 so it 's a fake real  
 now the easiest way
  fall down in this and not be real real  right the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage  
 and thereby repudiate that heritage  
 right the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business knowing where your heritage is what you have done in the past and what you have done in the past limits what you can do what you can get away with essentially in the future so
 you have to understand that past 
 think about disney again disney
 ten or fifteen years ago right the disney the company that is probably best known for family values out there disney bought the abc network
 the abc network affectionately known in the trade as the t & a network right that 's not too much jargon is it right the t & a network then it bought miramax known for its
  families everywhere couldn 't really trust what they were getting from disney it was no longer true to its heritage no longer true to walt disney that 's one of the reasons why they 're having such trouble today  
 and why roy disney is out to get michael eisner  
 because it is no longer true to itself so
 understand what your past limits what you can do in the future  when it comes to being what you say you are the easiest mistake that companies make
 is that they advertise things that they
  are not that 's when you 're perceived as fake as a phony company advertizing things that you 're not think about any hotel any airline any
 hospital right if you could check into the ads  you 'd have a great experience 
 but unfortunately you have to experience the actual hotel airline and hospital and then you have that disconnect then you have that perception that you are phony 
 so the number one
  to do when it comes to being what you say you are  
 is to provide places for people to experience who you are  for people to experience who you are right it 's
 not advertising does it that 's why you have companies like starbucks 
 right that doesn 't advertise at all they said you want to know who we
  you have to come experience us  
 and think about the economic value they have provided by that experience  right coffee at its core is what
 right  it 's beans  right it 's coffee beans  you know how much coffee is worth when treated as a commodity as a bean two or three cents per cup
 that 's what coffee is worth  but grind it roast it package it put it on a grocery store shelf  and now it 'll
  fifteen cents when you treat it as a good  
 take that same good and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer in a corner diner in a bodega a kiosk somewhere you get fifty cents maybe a buck per cup of coffee  
 but surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a starbucks with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there  
 and now because of that authentic experience you can charge
  five dollars for a cup of coffee 
 so authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility
