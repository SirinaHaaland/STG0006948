  we are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly  
 and in many of the places where it counts the most women are in fact taking control of everything
  in my mother 's day  she didn 't go to college not a lot of women did  and now for every two men who get a college degree three women will do the same 
 women  for the first time this year became the majority of the american workforce  and they 're starting to dominate lots of professions doctors lawyers  bankers accountants
  over fifty percent of managers are women these days  and in the fifteen professions projected to grow the most in the next decade all but two of them are dominated by women  so the
  global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men believe it or not 
 and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture what our romantic comedies look like what our marriages look like what our dating lives look like and our new set of superheroes 
 for a long time this is the image of american manhood that dominated tough rugged in control of his own environment a few years ago
  man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen 
 who is a parody of american manhood  and that 's what we have in our commercials today  
 the phrase first born son is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me in american fertility clinics seventy five
 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys  and in places where you wouldn 't think such as south korea india and china the very strict patriarchal societies 
  are starting to break down a little and families are no longer strongly preferring first born sons 
  can see it in the icelandic elections which you 'll hear about later  and you can see it on south korean surveys on son preference that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women  
 certainly this is not the first time that we 've had great progress with women the ' 20s and the ' 60s also come to mind but the difference is that back then it was driven by a very passionate 
  feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires  whereas this time it 's not about
  passion and it 's not about any kind of movement this is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in 
 the 200 000 year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end believe it or not and that 's why i talk about the end of men 
 now all you men out there this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes because the point is that this is happening to all of us
  myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom i dearly love  and this is why i like to talk about this because if we don 't acknowledge it then the transition 
  will be pretty painful but if we do take account of it then i think it will go much more smoothly  
  the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women and i remembered back to about ten years ago when i read a book by susan faludi
 called stiffed the betrayal of the american man in which she described how hard the recession had hit men and i started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession
  i realized that two things were different this time around the first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men that this was reflecting a deeper 
 underlying shift in our global economy and second that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men  but it was also about what was happening to women 
  statistics women take up most managerial jobs this second set of headlines you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift and look at that last headline young women earning more than young men 
 that particular headline comes to me from a market research firm  they were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future
  and they expected that it would be young families or young men just like it had always been but in fact they found something very surprising  it was young single women who were the major purchasers of houses
 in the neighborhood  and so they decided because they were intrigued by this finding to do a nationwide survey  
  so here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them 
 now i 've just laid out the picture for you but i still haven 't explained to you why this is happening and in a moment i 'm going to show you a graph and what you 'll see on this graph it begins in 
 just before women start flooding the workforce and it brings us up to our current day
  and basically what you 'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy now what does that mean it means that the economy is dividing into 
  jobs and that the middle the middle skill jobs and the the middle earning jobs are starting to drop out of the economy this has been going on for forty years now but this process is affecting men very differently than it 's
  affecting women you 'll see the women in red and you 'll see the men in blue you 'll watch them both drop out of the middle class but see what happens to women and see what happens to men  
 there we go  
 so watch that you see them both drop out of the middle class  watch what happens to the women  watch what happens to the men the men sort of stagnate there while the women zoom up in those high skill jobs  so what 's that about 
 it looks like women got some
  power boost on a video game or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth control pills that lets them
 shoot up high 
 but of course it 's not about that what it 's about is that the economy has changed a lot we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products  and now we have a service economy and an information
  those two economies require very different skills and as it happens women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been 
 it used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn 't have a college degree  but you had a specific set of skills and with the help of a union you could make yourself a pretty good middle class life  
 but that really isn 't true anymore  this new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength which is what 's helped men along all these years 
  the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills you basically need intelligence you need an ability to sit still and focus to communicate openly to 
  be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be and those are things that women do extremely well as we 're seeing  
  right  you would be issuing orders from above you would be very hierarchical you would tell everyone below you what to do
 but that 's not what an ideal leader is like now if you read management books now a leader is somebody who can foster creativity who can get his get the employees see i still say his who can get the employees to talk to each other who can basically build teams and get them
  and those are all things that women do very well  
 and then on top of that that 's created a kind of cascading effect women enter the workplace at the top  and then at the working class all the new jobs that are created are the kinds 
  of jobs that wives used to do for free at home  so that 's childcare  elder care and food preparation so those are all the jobs that are growing and those are jobs that women tend to do 
  former steelworker guy to watch their children at home  and that would be good for the men but that hasn 't quite happened yet to see what 's going to happen you can 't just look at the workforce that is now you have to look at our future workforce  and here the story is fairly simple 
 women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men  
 why this is a real mystery people have asked men why don 't they just go back to college to community college
  say and retool themselves learn a new set of skills well it turns out that they 're just very uncomfortable doing that they 're used to thinking of themselves as providers  and they can 't seem to build the social 
  networks that allow them to get through college so for some reason men just don 't end up going back to college  
  boy crisis is this idea that very young boys for whatever reason are doing worse in school than very young girls 
 and people have theories about that is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum and little girls are better at that than little boys or that we require kids to sit still too much and so boys
  initially feel like failures and some people say it 's because in 9th grade boys start start dropping out of school because i 'm writing a book about all
  looking into it so i don 't have the answer but in the mean time i 'm going to call on the worldwide education expert who 's my  10 year old daughter noa to talk to you about why the boys in her class
 do worse
  they were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely hr 
 so there you go  this whole thesis really came home to me when i went to visit a college in kansas city working class college  certainly when i was in college i had certain expectations about my life that my husband and i would both work
  and that we would equally raise the children  but these college girls had a completely different view of their future 
 basically the way they said it to me is that they would be working eighteen hours a day  that their husband would maybe have a job  but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies  and this was kind of a shocker to me  
 and then here 's my favorite quote from one of the girls men are the new ball and chain 
 now you laugh  but that quote has kind of a sting to it
  right  and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don 't reverse themselves without a lot of pain
 and that 's why i talk about us all going through this together  
 the night after i talked to these college girls i also went to a men 's group in kansas and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which i spoke to you about earlier they were men who had been contractors or they had
  building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom  and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support and the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age 
 he was telling them they no longer had any moral authority  that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore  and they were not really the providers so who were they and this was very disheartening for them  and what he
  did was he wrote down on the board
  and he said that 's her salary and then he wrote down $ twelve thousand 
 that 's your salary  so who 's the man now he asked them who 's the damn man she 's the man now 
 and that really sent a shudder through the room  and that 's part of the reason i like to talk about this because i think it can be pretty painful and we really have to
 work through it and the other reason it
  of urgent is because it 's not just happening in the u s it 's happening all over the world 
 in india  poor women are learning english faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in india in china a lot of the opening 
  up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses small businesses faster than men and here 's my favorite example which is in south korea 
  south korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about they basically enshrined the 
  status of women in the civil code and if women failed to birth male children they were basically treated like domestic servants  and sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child but over the '
  the south korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize  and so what they did was they started to push women into the workforce now they 've been asking a question since one thousand nine hundred and eighty five how strongly do you prefer a first born son 
 and now look at the chart  that 's from one thousand nine hundred and eighty five to two thousand and three how much do you prefer a first born son  so you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture 
 now because we haven 't fully processed this information it 's kind of coming back to us in our pop
  culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways where you can see that the stereotypes are changing and so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the 
 omega males popping up who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can 't find a job and they come up in lots of different forms so we have the perpetual adolescent 
  our bud light guy who 's the happy couch potato  
 and then here 's a shocker even america 's most sexiest man alive the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie  
 and then on the female side you have the opposite in which you have these crazy superhero women you 've got lady gaga  
 you 've got our new james bond who 's angelina jolie  
 and it 's not just for the young
  right  even helen mirren can hold a gun these days  and so it feels like we have to move from this place where we 've got these 
  images into something that feels a little more normal  so for a long time in the economic sphere we 've lived with the term glass ceiling 
 now i 've never really liked this term for one thing it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another because the men are these devious tricksters
  up there who 've put up this glass ceiling and we 're always below the glass ceiling the women and we we have a lot of skill and experience but it 's a trick so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling  
 and also shattering the glass ceiling is a terrible phrase  what crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling so
 the image that i like to think of instead of glass ceiling  is the high bridge
 it 's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge  but it 's also pretty exhilarating because it 's beautiful up there and you 're looking out on a beautiful view  
  and the great thing is there 's no trick like with the glass ceiling there 's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables there 's no hole in the middle that you 're going to fall through  
  colleagues or your babysitter to walk along with you and husbands can drag their wives across if their wives don 't feel ready  but the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to 
  know that you deserve to be on that bridge that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge  but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it
