  really here to talk about is the how okay so how exactly do we create this 
  if you will  innovation now i want to tell you a quick story we 'll go back a little more
  in fact the date i 'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date it was february 3rd two thousand and eight
 anyone remember what happened february 3rd two thousand and eight 
 super bowl i heard it over here  it was the date of the super bowl  and the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues john king and halee fischer wright and i 
 noticed as we began to debrief various super bowl parties is that it seemed to us that across the
  united states  if you will tribal councils had convened  
 and they had discussed things of great national importance like do we like the budweiser commercial 
 and do we like the nachos and who is going to win but they also talked about which candidate they were going to support  and if you go back in time
  it looked like hilary clinton was going to get the democratic nomination and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way  but when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect 
  had happened in these tribes all across the united states now what is a tribe a tribe is a group of about twenty so
  built that important things happen  and so as we surveyed the if you will representatives from various tribal councils that met also known as super bowl parties  we sent the following 
  email off to forty newspaper editors the following day february 4th we posted it on our website this was before super tuesday we said the tribes that we 're in are saying it 's going to be
  the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous ten years studying tribes studying these naturally occurring groups all of you are members of tribes in 
  walking around at the break many of you had met members of your tribe and you were talking to them and many of you were doing what great if you will tribal leaders do  which 
  is to find someone who is a member of a tribe and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe and make introductions
  that is in fact what great tribal leaders do  so here is the bottom line  
 if you focus in on a group like this this happens to be a usc game and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people you would in fact see not a single crowd just like there is
  not a single crowd here but you would see these tribes that are then coming together and from a distance it appears that it 's a single group and so people form tribes 
 they always have they always will just as fish swim and birds fly people form tribes it 's just what we do but here 's the rub not all tribes are the same 
  all a member of tribes  if you can find a way to take the tribes that you 're in and nudge them forward along these tribal stages to what we call stage 
  five which is the top of the mountain but we 're going to start with what we call stage one  now  this is the lowest of the stages you don 't want this okay  this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen but it 's one that i think we need to learn from 
  produces people who do horrible things this is the kid who shot up virginia tech 
 stage one is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes and then pool together with people who think like they do 
 stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons now again we don 't often deal with stage one  and i want to make the point that as members of society we need
  it 's not enough to simply write people off but let 's move on to stage two  now stage one you 'll notice says  in effect life sucks
 this other book that steve mentioned that just came out called the three laws of performance my colleague  
 steve zaffron and i argue that as people see the world so they behave well if people see the world
 in such a way that life sucks then their behavior will follow automatically from that it will be despairing hostility
  do whatever it takes to survive even if that means undermining other people now my birthday is coming up
 shortly  and my driver 's license expires  and the reason that that 's relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe  which looks like this 
 now am i saying that in every department of motor vehicles across the land you find a stage two culture
  the one near me where i have to go in just a few days  what i will say when i 'm standing in line is how can people be so dumb and yet live 
 now am i saying that there are dumb people working here actually no i 'm not  but i 'm saying the culture makes people dumb 
  stage two culture and we find these in all sorts of different places you find them in fact in the best organizations in the world you find them in all places in society i 've come across them at
 the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class but here is the point if you believe and you say to people in your tribe in effect my life sucks  
 i mean if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn 't suck but i don 't so it does if that 's how you talked imagine what kind of work would get done what kind of innovation would
  get done  the amount of world changing behavior that would happen  in fact it would be basically nil now when we go on to stage three this is the one that hits closest to home 
  for many of us because it is in stage three that many of us move and we park and we stay 
  now imagine having a whole room of people saying in effect i 'm great and you 're not or i 'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that a whole group of people
 communicating that way talking that way  i know this sounds like a joke three doctors walk into a bar  but in this case three doctors walk into an elevator i happened to be in the elevator collecting data
 for this book and one doctor said to the others did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine 
 and the other said no that 's great congratulations the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said well while you were you know doing your research notice the condescending tone while 
  you were off doing your research  i was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution and the third one got the same wry smile and said well while you were off doing your research  and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery that
  eventually we 'll train
 monkeys to do or cells or robots or maybe not even need to do it at all i was off running the future of the residency program which is really the future of medicine and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back and the 
  elevator door opened and they all walked out that is a meeting of a stage three tribe  now  we find these in places where really smart successful people show up like oh i don 't know
 here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation it is moving from stage three to stage four  
 let 's take a look at a quick video snippet this is from a
  employees volunteer time in the advice booth notice it looks like something out of a peanuts cartoon okay
 we 're going through the hallway here at zappos  this is a call center  notice how it 's decorated notice people are applauding for us they don 't
 know who we are and they don 't care and if they did they probably wouldn 't applaud
 you 'll notice the level of excitement notice  again how they decorate their office now what 's important to people at zappos 
 these may not be the things that are important to you but they value things like fun and they value creativity one of their stated values is be a little bit weird and you 'll notice they are a 
  little bit weird   so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual
  competence then something very important happens the group gels  and it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly 
  people into something larger into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence stage four tribes can do remarkable things but you 'll notice we 're not at the top of the mountain yet there is in fact another stage 
  not recognize the scene that 's up here  and if you take a look at the headline of stage five which is life is great this may seem a little incongruous  this is a scene or snippet 
 from the truth and reconciliation process in south africa for which desmond tutu won the nobel prize now think about that south africa  terrible atrocities had happened in the society  and people came together focused only on those two
  values truth and reconciliation there was no road map no one had ever done anything like this before and in this atmosphere where the only guidance was people 's 
  values and their noble cause  what this group accomplished was historic  and people at the time feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has
  descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end in fact south africa has not gone down that road largely because people like desmond tutu 
 set up a stage five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country to bring everyone together so people hear this and 
  they conclude the following as did we in doing the study  okay  got it i don 't want to talk stage one that 's like
  don 't want to talk like they do at the particular dmv that 's close to where dave lives i really don 't want to just say i 'm great because that kind of sounds narcissistic and then i won 't have any friends saying
 we 're great that sounds pretty good but i should really talk stage five right life is great well in fact there are three somewhat 
 findings that come out of all this the first one if you look at the declaration of independence and actually read it the phrase
  that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights i mean that 's stage five right life is great oriented only by our values no other guidance  in 
  fact most of the document is written at stage two my life sucks because i live under a tyrant  also known as king george we 're great  who is not great
  great leaders what about gandhi what about martin luther king i mean surely these were just people who preached life is great right just one little bit of happiness and joy after another in fact martin luther 
  king 's most famous line was at stage three he didn 't say we have a dream he said i have a dream why did he do that because most people are not at stage five
  percent of working tribes say these are employed tribes say i 'm great and you 're not and we have to duke it out every day so we resort to politics only about twenty two percent of tribes are at stage four  oriented by our values saying we 're
  and our values are beginning to unite us only two percent only two percent of tribes get to stage five and those are the ones that change the world so the first little finding from this 
 is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society  
 within their tribes to the next level i 'd like to show you some examples of this one of the people we interviewed was frank jordan  
 former mayor of san francisco before that he was chief of police in san francisco  
 and he grew up essentially in stage one and you know what changed his life it was walking into one of these a boys and girls club  now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco he went from being alive and
  passionate at stage one remember life sucks despairing hostility i will do whatever it takes to survive to walking into a boys and girls club  folding his arms sitting down in a chair 
 and saying wow my life really sucks  i don 't know anybody i mean if i was into boxing like they were then my life wouldn 't suck but i don 't so it does  so i 'm going to sit here in my chair and not
  in fact that 's progress  we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then over time getting them connected  
 so  what about moving from stage three to stage four  i want to argue that we 're doing that right here
 ted represents a set of values and as we unite around these values something really interesting begins to
  if you want this experience to live on as something historic  then at the reception tonight i 'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do 
  and call networking which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach extend your influence but instead find someone you don 't know and find someone else you don 't know and introduce them 
  do that they extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them not just to myself so that my following is greater  but i connect people who don 't know each other 
 to something greater than themselves and ultimately that adds to their values  but we 're not done yet  because then how do we go from stage four  which is great  to stage
  the story that i like to end with is this it comes out of a place called the gallup organization you know they do polls right  so it 's stage four we 're great who is not great  pretty much everybody else 
  who does polls if gallup releases a poll on the same day that nbc releases a poll people will pay attention to the gallup poll okay we understand that 
  instead of just polling what asia thinks or what the united states thinks or who thinks what about obama versus mccain or something like that what does the entire world think 
 and they found a way to do the first ever world poll they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics who reported being bored  and suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out how do we survey the population
  how do we survey populations that don 't have access to technology and speak languages we don 't speak and we don 't know anyone who speaks those languages because in order
 to achieve on this great mission we have to be able to do it incidentally they did pull it off and they released the
  the tribes that you 're in and
  nudge them forward
