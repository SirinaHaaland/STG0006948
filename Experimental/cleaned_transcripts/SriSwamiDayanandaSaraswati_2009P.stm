  a human child
 is born  
 and for quite a long time
 is a consumer
 it cannot be consciously a contributor
 it is helpless
  it is endowed with an instinct to survive  
 it needs
 the help of
 mother or a foster
  it can 't afford to
 doubt the person who tends the child  
 it has to totally surrender  
 as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist
  totally surrender
  that implies a lot of trust  
 that implies
 the trusted person
  as the child grows 
 it begins to discover
 that the person trusted
 is violating the trust
  a wordless blame 
 which is more more
 difficult to really resolve
 the wordless self blame 
 as the child grows to become an adult
 so far it has been a consumer  but the growth of a human being
 lies in his or her capacity
 to contribute to be a contributor
  i have enough 
 to be compassionate is not a joke it 's not that simple 
 one has to discover a certain bigness
  in oneself that bigness should be centered on oneself  not in terms of money 
 not in terms of power you 
 not in terms of any status that you can command in the society  
  on that self  it should be centered
 a bigness a wholeness otherwise compassion
 is just a word
 and a dream  
  thank god we are empathetic when somebody 's in pain we pick up the pain 
  these two guys fight it out  each one has got two games  
 it can be anybody 's game  
 what they have sweated so far has no meaning 
 one person wins
 the tennis etiquette is 
 both the players have to come to the net
 and shake hands 
 the winner boxes the air
 and kisses the ground
  throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it 
 and this guy has to come to the net when he comes to the net  
 you see his whole face face changes  
 it looks as though he 's wishing that he didn 't win
  why empathy  
 that 's human heart no human heart is denied of that empathy  
 no religion can demolish that by indoctrination 
 no culture no nation
 and nationalism
 nothing
 can touch it because it is empathy  and that
 capacity to empathize
 is the window through which
 you reach out to people  
 you do something that makes a difference in somebody 's life even words
 even time 
 compassion is not defined in one form 
 there 's no indian compassion  there 's no american compassion
  it is there in everybody it
 's experienced by people occasionally  
 then this occasional compassion  
  we are not talking about
 it will never remain occasional 
 by mandate you cannot make a person compassionate 
 you can 't say please love me 
 love is something you discover it
 's not an action  
 but in the english language it is also an action
 i will come to it later  
 so one has got to discover a certain wholeness  
 i am going to cite the possibility of being whole  
 which is within our experience  everybody 's experience
 in spite of
 a very tragic life  
 one is happy
 in moments which are very few and far between  and the one who is happy
  for a slapstick joke  
 accepts himself
 and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself  
 that means the whole universe  known things and unknown things all of them
  are totally accepted
 because you discover your wholeness in yourself 
 the subject me and the object the scheme of things
 fuse
 into oneness an experience nobody can
  say i am denied of 
 an experience common to all and sundry  
 that experience confirms
 that in spite of all your limitations
 all your wants
  and the credit cards and layoffs
 and finally baldness
 you can be happy  but the extension of the logic is
 that you don 't need to fulfill your desire to
  you are the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be 
 there 's no choice in this that only confirms the reality
 that the wholeness cannot
 be different from you cannot be minus you  it has got to be
  you  you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole  
 your moment of happiness reveals that reality that realization  that recognition 
 maybe i am the whole  maybe
  maybe the swami is right you start your new life 
 then everything becomes meaningful  
 i have no more reason to blame myself 
 if one has to blame oneself one has a million reasons plus many
 if i say  in spite of my body being limited
 if it is black it is not white if it is white it is not black 
 body is limited any which way you look at it limited  
 your knowledge is limited health is limited
  power is therefore limited and
 the cheerfulness is going to be limited compassion is going to be limited  
 everything is going to be limitless  you cannot command compassion
 unless you become limitless and nobody can become
  limitless either you are
 or you are not period  
 and there is no way of your being not limitless too 
 your own experience
 reveals in spite of all limitations you are the whole  
  wholeness is the reality of you
 when you relate to the world  it is love first  
 when you relate to the world the dynamic
 manifestation of the wholeness
 is what we say  love and itself becomes compassion
  if the object that you relate to
 evokes that that emotion 
 then that again transforms into
  compassion  to discover compassion you need to
 to discover the capacity to give and share  you need to be giving and sharing there is no shortcut it is like swimming by swimming  
 you learn swimming by swimming
  learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water 
 you learn swimming by swimming you learn cycling by cycling  
 you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you
 to eat what you cook
  i say  
 you have to fake it and make it 
 you need to
 my predecessor meant that 
 you have to act it out
  you have to act compassionately  
 there is no verb for compassion  but you have an adverb
 for compassion  that 's interesting to me 
  how to act compassionately if you don 't have compassion  that is where you fake 
 you fake it and make it this is the mantra of the united states of america 
 you fake it and make it
  you act compassionately as though you have compassion  grind your teeth  take all the support system 
 if you know how to pray pray  
 ask for compassion  let me act compassionately 
 do it you 'll discover compassion
 and also slowly a relative compassion and slowly
  perhaps if you get the right teaching  you 'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation
 of the reality of yourself which is oneness wholeness and that 's what you are
