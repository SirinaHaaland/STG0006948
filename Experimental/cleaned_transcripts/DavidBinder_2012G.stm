  i had been waiting my whole life to get to sydney  i got to the airport to the hotel checked in and sitting there in the lobby was a brochure for the sydney festival i thumbed through it and i came across a show called
  suburban streets of minto become the stage
 for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of minto 
 what was this place called minto sydney as i would learn is a city of suburbs and minto lies southwest about an hour away i
 have to say it wasn 't exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under i mean i 'd thought about the harbour bridge or
  bondi beach  but minto  but still i 'm a producer and the lure of 
 theater project was more than i could resist 
 so  off i went into friday afternoon traffic and i 'll never forget what i saw when i got there for the performance  
 the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house 
  who were the performers they came out of their houses and they performed these autobiographical dances
 on their lawns on their driveways the show is a collaboration with a 
  performance company called lone twin lone twin had come to minto and worked with the residents  and they had created these dances this
  girl she came out and started to dance on her front lawn  and her father peered out the window
  see what all the noise and commotion was about and he soon joined her 
 and he was followed by her little sister  
 and soon they were all dancing this joyous exuberant dance right there on their lawn 
 and as i walked through the neighborhood i was amazed and i was moved
 by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this
  event 
 minto live brought sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists and really celebrated the diversity of sydney on its own terms 
 the sydney festival which produced minto live i think represents a new kind of  21st century arts festival 
 these festivals are radically open 
 they can transform cities and
  communities to understand this  i think it kind of makes sense to look where we 've come from 
 modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of world war ii civic leaders created these annual events
 to celebrate culture as the highest
 the highest expression of the human spirit in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven the edinburgh festival was born and avignon was born and hundreds of others would follow in their
  wake 
 the work they did was very very high art 
 and stars came along like laurie anderson and merce cunningham and robert lepage who made work for this circuit and you had these seminal shows like the mahabharata and the monumental einstein on the beach 
 but as the decades passed 
 these festivals they really became the establishment and as the culture and capital accelerated
  the internet brought us all together high and low kind of disappeared 
 a new kind of festival emerged the old festivals  they continued to thrive but from brighton to rio to perth something new was emerging 
 and these festivals were really different  
 they 're open these festivals because like in minto
  they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential they 're open because they ask the audience to be
 a player a protagonist a partner  rather than a passive spectator  
 and they 're open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings and so much of the work they do is  site specific or outdoor work
  the new festival it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance  companies like de la guarda which i produce 
 and punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action 
 but the german performance company rimini protokoll takes this all to a whole new level 
 in a series of shows that includes one hundred percent vancouver
 rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society  
 rimini protokoll chooses one hundred people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class through a careful process that begins 
 three months before and then those one hundred people share stories about themselves and their lives  and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at
  that moment  
 lift has always been a pioneer in the use of venues  
 they understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere you can do a show in a schoolroom 
 in an airport 
 in a department store window 
 artists are explorers who better to show us the city anew artists can take us to a far flung part of the city
  that we haven 't explored or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into 
 an artist  i think can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives 
 back to back is an australian company of people with intellectual disabilities 
 i saw their amazing show in new york at the staten island ferry terminal
 at rush hour we the audience were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal 
 the actors were right there in front of us right there among the commuters  and we could hear them  but we might not have otherwise seen them  
 so back to back takes  site specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily
  lives  
 so  the dialogue with the local and the global 
 the audience as participant and player and protagonist  the innovative use of site all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe 
 royal de luxe 's giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days
  for the sultan 's elephant royal de luxe came to central london and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl
 and her friend a time traveling elephant  
 for a few days  they transformed a massive city into a community
  is about transformation then there can be no more transformative experience 
 what ' the sultan 's elephant ' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people 
 we can talk about the economic impacts of of these festivals on on their cities but i 'm much
  things like how a festival helps a city to express itself how it lets it come into its own 
 festivals promote diversity they bring neighbors into dialogue they increase creativity they offer opportunities for civic pride  
 they improve our general psychological
  they make cities better places to live
  the city and a reclamation of
