  my talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about it 's called the arab spring  anyone heard of it 
 so in two thousand and eleven  power shifted
  from the few to the many from oval offices to central squares from carefully guarded airwaves
 to open source networks  
 but before
 was a global symbol of liberation there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways
 i study muslim societies around the world at gallup
  since two thousand and one we 've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people young and old men and women  educated and illiterate 
 my talk today draws on this research to reveal why arabs rose up
 and what they want now
 now this region 's very diverse and every country is unique  but those who revolted shared a common set of grievances
 and have similar demands today i 'm going to focus a lot of my talk on egypt it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there of course
  but it 's the largest arab country and it 's also one with a
  deal of influence  but i 'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region
 to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics
 and how this impacts women  revealing some surprises along the way  
 so after analyzing mounds of data what we discovered was this
  unemployment and poverty alone
 did not lead to the arab revolts of two thousand and eleven  
 if an act of desperation by a tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions  it was the difference between what arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel
  to tell you what i mean consider this trend in egypt on paper the country was doing great 
 in fact it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth  
 but under the surface was a very different reality 
 in two thousand and ten right before the revolution  even though gdp per capita had been growing at five percent for several years egyptians had never felt worse about their lives
 now this is very unusual because globally we find that not surprisingly people feel better as their country gets richer and
 that 's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services  but it was exactly the opposite in egypt as the country
  actually rose and people 's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted  
 but it wasn 't just anger at economic injustice  
 it was also people 's deep longing for freedom  
 contrary to the clash of civilizations theory arabs didn 't despise
  despise western liberty  they desired it 
 as early as two thousand and one we asked arabs and muslims in general around the world what they admired most about the west  
 among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice in their own words to
  their political system is transparent and it 's following democracy in its true sense 
 another said it was liberty and freedom and being  open minded with each other 
 majorities as high as ninety percent and greater in egypt indonesia and iran told us in two thousand and five
  that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country
  they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right  especially in egypt 
 eighty eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help muslims progress the highest percentage of any country we surveyed  
 but pressed up against these democratic aspirations
 was a very different day to day experience  especially in egypt
  while aspiring to democracy the most they were the least likely population in the world
 to say that they had actually voiced their opinion to a public official in the last month at only four percent 
 so while economic development made a few people rich  it left many more
  worse off as people felt less and less free they also felt less and less provided for 
 so rather than viewing their former regimes as
 generous if overprotective fathers  they viewed them as essentially prison wardens  so now that egyptians have ended mubarak 's
 they potentially could be an example for the region 
 if egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law  
 it could be a model 
 if however  the core issues that propelled the revolution aren 't addressed the consequences could be catastrophic
 not just for egypt  but for the entire region
  region 
 the signs don 't look good some have said
 islamists not the young liberals that sparked the revolution  won the majority in parliament 
 the military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country 's economy continues
  evaluating egypt on this basis alone however  ignores the real revolution 
 because egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years  far less divided on
  lines than we would think
 and poised for the demands of democracy  whether they support islamists or liberals egyptians  ' priorities for
  this government are identical and they are jobs  stability and education not moral policing  
 but most of all for the first time in decades they expect to be active participants not spectators 
 in the affairs of their country 
 i was meeting with a group of newly elected parliamentarians from egypt and tunisia a couple of weeks ago and what really struck me about them
  was that they weren 't
 only optimistic  but they kind of struck me as nervous for lack of a better word one said to me 
 our people used to gather in cafes to watch football or soccer as we say in america 
 and now they gather to watch parliament
  really watching us and we can 't help
 but worry that we 're not going to live up to their expectations and what really struck me is that less than twenty four months ago
  it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government 
 and the reason that they 're expecting a lot is because
  for the future so right before the revolution
 we said that egyptians had never felt worse about their lives but not only that they thought their future would be no better 
 what really changed after the ouster of mubarak wasn 't that life got easier  it actually got harder
  but people 's expectations for their future went up significantly and
  this hope this optimism endured a year of turbulent transition 
 one reason that there 's this optimism is because  
 contrary to what many people have said most egyptians think things really have changed in many ways  so while egyptians were known for their 
 turnout in elections before the revolution the last election had around seventy percent voter
  turnout men and women  
 where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in two thousand and ten i 'm surprised it was a quarter ninety percent thought that this last election was honest 
 now why this matters is because we discovered a link between people 's faith in their
 democratic process
 and their faith that
  oppressed people can change their situation
 through peaceful means alone 
 now i know what some of you are thinking 
 the egyptian people and many other arabs who 've revolted and are in
  transition have very high expectations of the government  they 're just
 victims of a long time autocracy  expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems
 but this conclusion
 would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in egypt far from the cameras in tahrir square  and that
  egyptians ' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves 
 in the country once known for its passive resignation where as bad as things got only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official today ninety percent tell us that if there 's a
  believe they not only have the responsibility  but the power
 to make change  and this empowerment
 also applies to women  whose role in the revolts cannot be underestimated  they were doctors and
  dissidents  artists and organizers a full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas
 to ask or to demand
 liberty and justice in egypt were women 
 now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of islamist parties means
  women 
 what we 've found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there 's no female consensus 
 we found that women in one country look more like the men in that country than their female counterparts across the border  
 now what this suggests is that how women view
 religion 's role in society is shaped more by their own country 's culture and context
 than one monolithic view that religion is simply bad for women  
 where women agree  however is on their own role  and that it must be central and
  and here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country on the issue of women 's rights  now how men feel about women 's rights
 matters to the future of this region  because we discovered a link between men 's support for women 's employment
 and how many women are actually employed in professional fields
  so the question becomes what drives men 's support for women 's rights  what about
 men 's views of religion and law [
 does ] a man 's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women 's rights 
 the answer is no we found absolutely no correlation no impact whatsoever
  between these two variables what drives men 's support for women 's employment
 is men 's employment 
 their level of education as well as a high score on their country 's u n human development index 
 what this means is that human development 
 not secularization
  is what 's key to women 's empowerment in the transforming middle east 
 and the transformation continues 
 from wall street to mohammed mahmoud street  it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people 
 thank you
