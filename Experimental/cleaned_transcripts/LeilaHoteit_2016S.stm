  who are these people 
 it was an innocent question from my young daughter alia around the time when she was three 
 we were walking along with my husband in one of abu dhabi 's big fancy malls  
  was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall it featured the three rulers of the united arab emirates 
 as she tucked in my side i bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the uae
 who had worked hard to develop their nation and preserve its unity 
 she asked mom  why is it that here where we live  and back in lebanon  where grandma and grandpa live 
 we never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls is it because women are not important
 this is probably the hardest question i 've had to answer in my years as a parent and in my 16 plus years of professional life for that matter  
 i had grown up in my hometown in lebanon  the younger of two daughters
 to a very hard working pilot and director of operations for the lebanese
  i to pursue our education even though our culture emphasized at the time
 that it was sons and not daughters who should be professionally motivated  
 i was one of very few girls of my generation who left home at eighteen to study abroad 
 my father didn 't have a son  and so i in a sense
  a couple of decades  and i hope i didn 't do too badly in making my father proud of his would be son 
 as i got my bachelor 's and phd in electrical engineering did r & d in the uk then consulting in the middle east  
 i have always been in male dominated environments  
 truth be told  i have never found a role model i could truly identify with 
 my mother 's generation wasn 't into professional leadership
  there were some encouraging men along the way  but none knew the demands and pressures i was facing  
 pressures that got particularly acute when i had my own two beautiful children 
 and although western women love to give us poor  oppressed arab women advice  
 they live different lives with different constraints  
 so arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models
 we have had to juggle more than arab men and we have had to face more cultural rigidity than western women 
 as a result  i would like to think that we poor oppressed women actually have some useful certainly  hard earned lessons to share  
 lessons that might turn out useful for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world 
  there is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success  resilience well what exactly is resilience  and how do you develop it 
 i believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel 
 in my previous job
  well before my current firm  i was working with a man we will call john 
 i had teamed up with john and was working hard hoping he would notice how great i was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm  
 i was in addition to delivering on my consulting projects  writing passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment 
 one day  i got to present my research to a roomful of
 john was part of the audience listening for the first time to the details of my study 
 as i proceeded with my presentation i could see john in the corner of my eye 
 he had turned a dark shade of pink and had slid under his chair in apparent shame  
 i finished my presentation to an applauding audience and we rushed out and jumped into the car there he exploded
 what you did up there was unacceptable you are a consultant not an activist 
 i said john  i don 't understand 
 i presented a couple of gender parity indices  
 and some conclusions about the arab world  yes we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index but what is it that i said or presented that
  to which he replied the whole premise of your study is wrong what you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society 
 he paused then added when women have children their place is in the home 
 time stood still for a long while and all i could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was you can forget
  's just never going to happen 
 it took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications  but once i did i reached three conclusions 
 one that these were his issues his complexes  there may be many like him in our society but i would never let their issues become mine 
 two that i needed another sponsor and fast
  i got one by the way and boy was he great 
 and three that i would get to show john what women with children can do 
 i apply this lesson equally well to my personal life as i have progressed in my career  i have received many words of encouragement  
 but i have also often been met by women men and couples
 who have clearly had an issue with my husband and i having chosen the path of a dual career couple
  so you get this well meaning couple
 who tells you straight out at a family gathering or at a friends gathering that come on you must know you 're not a great mom given how much you 're investing in your career right 
 i would lie if i said these words didn 't hurt 
 my children are the most precious thing to me and the thought that i could be failing them in any way is intolerable  
 but just like i did with john i quickly reminded myself that these were their issues their complexes  so instead
  of replying  i gave back one of my largest smiles as i saw in flashing light  the following sign in my mind 's eye [ be happy it drives people crazy ] 
 you see as a young woman in these situations you have two options you can either decide to internalize
  these negative messages that are being thrown at you to let them make you feel like a failure like success is way too hard to ever achieve 
 or you can choose to see that others ' negativity is their own issue  and instead transform it into your own personal fuel  
 i have learned
 to always go for option two and i have found that it has taken me from strength to strength and it 's true what they say success is the best
  some women in the middle east are lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career  
 correction i should say smart enough because who you marry is your own choice and you 'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career  
 still today the arab man is not an equal contributor in the home  it 's simply not expected by our society  and even frowned upon as not very manly
  as for the arab woman our society still assumes that her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity of her children and husband  
 she mostly exists for her family  
 things are changing  but it will take time for now it means that the professional arab woman has to somehow maintain the perfect home 
 make sure that her children 's every need is being taken care of
  manage her demanding career 
 to achieve this i have found the hard way that you need to apply your hard earned professional skills to your personal life  
 you need to work your life  
 here is how i do this in my personal life  
 one thing to know about the middle east is that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help  
 the challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively just like i would in my business life
  i have based the selection of who would support me with my children while i 'm at work on a strong referral  cristina had worked for four years with my sister
 and the quality of her work was well established 
 she is now an integral member of our family having been with us since alia was six months old 
 she makes sure that the house is running smoothly while i 'm at work and i make sure to empower her
  optimal conditions for her and my children  just like i would my best talent at work 
 this lesson applies whatever your childcare situation  
 whether an au pair  nursery part time nanny that you share with someone else choose very carefully  
 and empower 
 if you look at my calendar you will see
  this is sacred time i have done this ever since alia was a baby 
 i do everything in my power to protect this time so that i can be home by then to spend quality time with my children asking them about their day  
 checking up on homework  reading them a bedtime story and giving them lots
  of kisses and cuddles if i 'm traveling in whatever the time zone i use skype to connect with my children even if i am miles away 
 our son burhan is five years old  and he 's learning to read and do basic maths  
 here 's another confession  i have found that our daughter is actually more successful at teaching him these skills than i am 
 laughter it started as a game 
  to her little brother  and i have found that these sessions actually improve burhan 's literacy  
 increase alia 's sense of responsibility and strengthen the bonding between them a win win all around 
 the successful arab women i know
 have each found their unique approach to working their life as they continue to shoulder the lion 's share of responsibility in the home 
 but this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother this is also
  about being in the present 
 when i am with my children 
 i try to leave work out of our lives instead of worrying about how many minutes i can spend with them every day
 i focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments moments where i 'm seeing my kids  hearing them connecting with them [ join forces don 't compete ]
 arab women of my generation have not been very visible in the public eye as they
  grew up this explains i think to some extent why you find so few women in politics in the arab world  the upside of this however is that we have spent
 a lot of time developing a social skill behind the scenes 
 in coffee shops in living rooms on the phone a social skill that is very important to success  
  i would say the average arab woman has a large network of friends and acquaintances  the majority of those are also women 
 in the west  it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women hoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room this leads to the 
  competitive behavior between professional women if there 's only room for one woman at the top then you can 't make room for others  much less lift them up 
 arab women generally
  speaking have not fallen for this psychological trap  faced with a patriarchal society they have found that by helping each other out  all benefit 
 in my previous job  i was the most senior woman in the middle east  so one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues couldn 't bring many benefits and that i should instead invest my time developing my relationships with male seniors and peers
 two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women 
 it was the head of marketing who initially suggested i be considered as a young global leader to the world economic forum  
 she was familiar with my media engagements and my publications and when she was asked to voice her opinion she highlighted my name 
 it was a young consultant a saudi lady and friend 
  who helped me sell my first project in saudi arabia a market i was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman 
 she introduced me to a client and that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in saudi 
 today  i have two senior women on my team  and i see making them successful as key to my own success 
 women continue to advance in the world  not fast enough  but we 're moving the
  is making progress despite many recent setbacks 
 just this year  the uae appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet for a total of eight female ministers 
 that 's nearly twenty eight percent of the cabinet  and more than many developed countries can claim 
 this is today my daughter alia 's favorite picture 
 this is the result no doubt of great leadership  but it is also the result of strong arab women not giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries 
 it is the result
  arab women deciding every day like me
 to convert shit into fuel to work their life to keep work out of their life  and to join forces and not compete  
 as i look to the future my hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage some twenty thirty years from now
 are that she be as proud to call herself her mother 's daughter as her father 's daughter 
 my hopes for my son are that by then the expression her mother 's son
  or mama 's boy would have taken on a completely different meaning thank you
