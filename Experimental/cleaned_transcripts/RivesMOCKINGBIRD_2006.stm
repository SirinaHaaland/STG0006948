 i 'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird molotov cocktails
  oh i 'm going to be the johnny appleseed of sound
 cruising random city streets rocking a drop top cadillac with a big backseat packing like thirteen brown paper walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds and i 'll get everybody
 i 'll get the nitwit on the network news saying we 'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis i 'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice
  get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is
 i 'll get your postman making dinner plans i 'll get the last time you lied i 'll get baby just give me the frickin tv guide i 'll get a lonely little sentence with real error in it yeah i guess i could come inside but only for a minute
 i 'll get an esl class in chinatown learning it 's raining it 's pouring i 'll put a mockingbird on a late night train just to get an old man snoring i 'll get your ex lover telling someone else good morning
 i 'll get everyone 's good mornings i don 't care how you make them aloha

 what does a violin have to do with technology where in the world is this world heading on one
 one end gold bars on the other an entire planet
 we are twelve billion light years from the edge that 's a guess space is length and breadth continued indefinitely but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in america because countries 
 are beginning to eat like us live like us and die like us you might want to avert your gaze because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing 
 there 's about ten million phage per job it 's a very strange world inside a nanotube
  women can talk black men ski white men build strong buildings we build strong suns the surface of the earth is absolutely riddled with holes and here we are
 right in the middle
