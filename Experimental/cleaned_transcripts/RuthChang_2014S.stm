  hard choice you 'll face in the near future it might be between two careers artist and accountant
 or places to live the city or the country
 or even between two people to marry you could marry betty or you could marry lolita or it might be a choice about
  whether to have children to have an ailing parent move in with you to raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by but leaves you cold  
 or whether to donate your life savings to charity  
 chances are the hard choice you thought of was something big something momentous something that matters to you 
 hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing hand wringing the gnashing of teeth
 but i think we 've misunderstood hard choices and the role they play in our lives  
 understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses 
 what makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate in any easy choice one alternative is better than the other  
  one alternative is better in some ways the other alternative is better in other ways  and neither is better than the other overall 
 you agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city
 or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country 
 because staying is better in some ways  moving is better in others  and neither is better than the other overall  
 we shouldn 't think that all hard choices are big
  let 's say you 're deciding what to have for breakfast you could have high fiber bran cereal
 or a chocolate donut  suppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness 
 the cereal is better for you the donut tastes way better  but neither is better than the other overall a hard choice  
 realizing that small choices can also be hard may make
  big hard choices seem less intractable
  after all we manage to figure out what to have for breakfast so maybe we can figure out whether to stay in the city or uproot for the new job in the country  
 we also shouldn 't think that hard choices are hard because we are stupid
  when i graduated from college i couldn 't decide between two careers philosophy and law  i really loved philosophy 
 there are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher  and all from the comfort of an armchair  
 but i came from a modest immigrant family
 where my idea of luxury was having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich in my school lunchbox  so the thought of spending my whole life
 sitting around in armchairs just
  thinking well 
 that struck me as the height of extravagance and frivolity  
 so i got out my yellow pad i drew a line down the middle  and i tried my best to think of the reasons for and against
 each alternative 
 i remember thinking to myself  if only i knew what my life in each career would be like  
 if only god or netflix would send me a
 of my two possible future careers i 'd be set i 'd compare them side by side  i 'd see that one was better and the choice would be easy
 but i got no dvd  and because i couldn 't figure out which was better  i did what many of us do in hard choices  i took the safest
  fear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer
  and as i discovered lawyering didn 't quite fit it wasn 't who i was  
 so now i 'm a philosopher  and i study hard choices 
 and i can tell you  that fear of the unknown while a common motivational default
 in dealing with hard choices  
  rests on a misconception of them 
 it 's a mistake to think that in hard choices  one alternative really is better than the other  
 but we 're too stupid to know which and since we don 't know which we might as well take the least risky option  
 even taking two alternatives side by side with full information a choice can still be hard 
 hard choices are hard
 not because of
  if there 's no best option  if the scales don 't tip in favor of one alternative
 over another  then surely the alternatives must be equally good  
 so maybe the right thing to say in hard choices is that they 're between equally good options but
 that can 't be right if alternatives are equally good  you should just flip a coin between them  and it seems a mistake to think here 's how you
  should decide between careers  places to live people to marry flip a coin  
 there 's another reason for thinking that hard choices aren 't choices between equally good options  
 suppose you have a choice between two jobs you could be an investment banker
 or a graphic artist there are a variety of things that matter in such a choice
  like the excitement of the work 
 achieving financial security having time to raise a family and so on 
 maybe the artist 's career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of pictorial expression  
 maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation
  imagine the two jobs however you like  so that neither is better than the other
  now suppose we improve one of them a bit  suppose the bank  wooing you 
 adds five hundred dollars a month to your salary  does the extra money now make the banking job
 better than the artist one 
 not necessarily a higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before  but it might not
  be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist  
 but if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn 't make it better than the other  then the two original jobs could not have been equally good  
 if you start with two things that are equally good and you improve one of them  it now must be better than the other  
 that 's not the case with options in hard choices
  so now we 've got a puzzle
  we 've got two jobs neither is better than the other  nor are they equally good  
 so how are we supposed to choose  something seems to have gone wrong here
 maybe the choice itself is problematic  and comparison is impossible 
  that can 't be right  it 's not like we 're trying to choose between two things that can 't be compared 
 we 're weighing the merits of two jobs after all not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs 
 a comparison of the overall merits of two jobs is something we can make 
 and one we often do make 
 i think the puzzle arises because of an unreflective assumption we make about value
  we unwittingly assume that values like justice beauty kindness 
 are akin to scientific quantities like length mass and weight 
 take any comparative question not involving value  such as which of two suitcases is heavier
  there are only three possibilities the weight of one is greater  lesser or equal to the weight of the other
  properties like weight can be represented by real numbers one two three and so on
 and there are only three possible comparisons between any two real numbers 
 one number is greater  lesser or equal to the other  
  we tend to assume
 that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world 
 but the world of value is different from the world of science  the stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers  the stuff of the other world can 't 
 we shouldn 't assume
 that the world of is of lengths and weights has the same structure as the world of
  ought of what we should do
  so if what matters to us a child 's delight  the love you have for your partner can 't be represented by real numbers 
 then there 's no reason to believe that in choice  there are only three possibilities
 that one alternative is better  worse or equal to the other  we need to introduce a new
  fourth relation
 beyond being better  worse or equal 
 that describes what 's going on in hard choices  
 i like to say that the alternatives are on a par when alternatives are on a par it may matter very much which you choose  
 but one alternative isn 't better than the other
  the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value  in the same league of value  while at the same time being very different in kind of value  
 that 's why the choice is hard  
 understanding hard choices in this way uncovers something about ourselves we didn 't know 
 each of us has the power to create reasons  
 imagine a world in which every choice you
  face is an easy choice  that is there 's always a best alternative 
 if there 's a best alternative  then that 's the one you should choose  because part of being rational is doing the better thing rather than the worse thing choosing what you have most reason to choose 
 in such a world we 'd have most reason
 to wear black socks instead of pink socks to eat cereal instead of donuts to live in the city
  rather than the country to marry betty instead of lolita a world full of only easy choices would enslave us to reasons 
 when you think about it it 's nuts
 to believe that the reasons given to you
 dictated that you had most reason to pursue the exact hobbies you do
 to live in the exact house you do to work at the exact job you do  instead you faced alternatives
 that were on a par
 hard choices and you made reasons for yourself
 to choose that hobby  that house and that job 
 when alternatives are on a par  the reasons given to us the ones that determine
  whether we 're making a mistake are silent as to what to do
  it 's here in the space of hard choices  that we get to exercise our normative power
 the power to create reasons for yourself to make yourself
 into the kind of person for whom country living is preferable to the urban life
  when we choose between options that are on a par  
 we can do something really rather remarkable  we can put our very selves behind an option  
 here 's where i stand  
 here 's who i am i am for banking  i am for chocolate donuts 
 this response in hard choices is a rational response
  response but it 's not dictated by reasons given to us rather it 's supported by reasons created by us  
 when we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that we wholeheartedly
 become the people that we are you might say that we become the authors of our own lives
  so when we face hard choices  
 we shouldn 't beat our head against a wall trying to figure out which alternative is better  there is no best alternative  
 instead of looking for reasons out there we should be looking for reasons in here who am i to be 
 you might decide to be a pink
  what we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us 
 now people who don 't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are drifters  we all know
 people like that i drifted into being a lawyer  i didn 't put my agency behind lawyering i wasn 't for lawyering  
 drifters allow the world
 to write the story of their lives they let mechanisms of reward and punishment
 pats on the head fear the easiness of an option to determine what they do  so the lesson of hard
  on what you can put your agency behind on what you can be for 
 and through hard choices  become that person  
 far from being sources of agony and dread hard choices are precious opportunities
 for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out
 and it is here in the space of hard choices  that we have the power to create reasons for ourselves to become the distinctive people that we are 
 and that 's why hard choices are not a curse but a godsend
