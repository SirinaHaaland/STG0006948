  as a magician i try to create images that make people stop and think  i also try to challenge myself to do things that
 doctors say are not possible  i was buried alive in new york city in a coffin buried alive
  in a coffin in april 
  for a week 
 i lived there with nothing but water  and it ended up being so much fun that i decided i could pursue
 doing more of these things the next one is i froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in new york city 
 that one was way more difficult than i had expected
 the one after that i stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for thirty six hours  i began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads  
 so next i went to london 
 in london i lived in a glass box for forty four days with nothing but water it was for me one of the most difficult things i 'd ever done but it was
  also the most beautiful there was so many skeptics  especially the press in london that
 they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me 
 so i felt very validated when the new england journal of medicine actually used the research for science 
 my next pursuit was i wanted to see how
  long i could go without breathing like how long i could survive with nothing not even air 
 i didn 't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life 
 as a young magician  
 i was obsessed with houdini and his underwater challenges  
 so i began early on competing against the other kids  seeing how long i could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe
 five times while i stayed under on one breath  
 by the time i was a teenager i was able to hold my breath for three minutes and thirty seconds  
 i would later find out that was houdini 's personal record in one
 thousand nine 
 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice
 ice and was trapped under a river he
 was underneath not breathing for forty five minutes  
 when the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage his core temperature had dropped to seventy seven degrees 
 as a magician i think everything is possible  and i think if something is done by one person it can be done by
  i started to think if the boy could survive
 without breathing for that long there must be a way that i could do it
 so i met with a top neurosurgeon and i asked him how long is it possible to go without breathing like how long could i go without air 
 and he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk
 of hypoxic brain damage  so i took that as a challenge basically
  i figured that i could do something similar  and i created a water tank  and i filled it with ice
 and freezing cold water  and i stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop  
 and i was shivering in my first attempt to hold my breath i couldn 't even last a minute  so i realized that was completely not going to work
 i went to talk to a doctor friend
 and i asked him how could i 
  i want to hold my breath for a really long time how could it be done and he said david you 're a magician  create the illusion of not breathing it will be much easier
  he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather with a co2 scrubber  which was basically
 a tube from home depot with a balloon duct taped to it  
 that he thought we could put inside of me and somehow be able to
 circulate the air and rebreathe with this
  this is a little hard to watch but this is that attempt 
 so that clearly wasn 't going to work 
 then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing there is a chemical that 's called perflubron  and it 's so high in oxygen levels that in theory
  you could breathe it 
 so i got my hands on that chemical filled the sink up with it and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in which was really impossible it 's 
  basically like trying to breathe as a doctor said while having an elephant standing on your chest so that idea disappeared  
  would it be possible to hook up a heart lung bypass machine
 and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood  
 which was another insane idea obviously 
 then i thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas to actually do it 
 to actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain
 so  i started researching into pearl divers you know
 because they go down for four minutes on one breath and when i was researching pearl divers i found the world of free diving 
 it was the most
 amazing thing that i ever discovered pretty much there is
  there is depth records where people go as deep as they can and then there is static apnea that 's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving 
 that was the one that i studied the first thing that i learned is when you 're holding your breath  you should never move at all that wastes energy  and that
 depletes oxygen and it builds up co2 in your blood so i
  learned never to move and i learned how to slow my heart rate down  i had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that i wasn 't in my body and just control that 
 and then i learned how to purge  purging is basically hyperventilating you blow in and out breathing
 you do that you get lightheaded you get tingling  and you 're really ridding your body of
  when you hold your breath it 's infinitely easier then i learned that you have to take a huge breath and
 just hold and relax and never let any air out and just hold and relax through all the pain 
 every morning  this is for months i would wake up and the first thing that i would do is i would hold my breath
 for
 i would hold my breath for forty four minutes  so basically what that means is i would purge i 'd breathe really hard for a minute  and i would hold immediately after for five and a half minutes 
  then i would breathe again for a minute  purging as hard as i can then immediately after that i would hold again for five and a half minutes i would repeat this process eight times in a row 
  headaches 
 basically i 'm not the best person to talk to when i 'm doing that stuff 
 i started learning about the world record holder his name is tom sietas  and this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath  he 's six foot four he 's one hundred and sixty pounds 
 and his total lung capacity is twice the
  i had to drop fifty pounds in three months  so everything that i put into my body i considered
 as medicine every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value  i ate really small controlled portions throughout the
  the thinner i was the longer i was able to hold my breath  and by eating so well and training so hard 
 my resting heart rate dropped to thirty eight beats per minute  which is lower than most olympic athletes 
 in four months of
  i was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes 
 i wanted to try holding my breath everywhere i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress 
 i decided that i was going to break the world record live on prime time television the world record was eight minutes and
  guy with the whale lungs i told you about i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center and
 if i stayed there a week not eating i would get comfortable in that situation and i would slow my metabolism which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it
 i was completely wrong i entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date  and i thought everything
  seemed to be on track  two days before my big breath hold attempt for the record  the producers of my television special thought that
 just watching somebody holding their breath  and almost drowning is too boring for television 
 laughter so i had to add handcuffs
  while holding my breath to escape from this was a critical mistake 
 because of the movement  i was wasting oxygen  and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions 
 by seven eight i started to black out 
 and by seven minutes and thirty seconds  they had to pull my body out and bring me back
  i had failed on every level 
 so  naturally  the only way out of the slump that i could think of
 was i decided to call oprah 
 i told her that i wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had this was a different
  record this was a pure  o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at thirteen minutes
 so basically you breathe pure  o2 first oxygenating your body flushing out co2 and you are able to hold much longer 
 i realized that my real
  oprah gave me four months to prepare and train  
 so i would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night a hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at fifteen thousand feet so it 's like base camp everest 
 what that does is you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body
  helps you carry oxygen better 
 every morning again after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out my first attempt on pure o2 i was able to go up to fifteen 
  minutes  so it was a pretty big success  the neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind at fifteen minutes your brain is done
  up and i was fine there was one person there that was definitely not impressed it was my
 while i was breaking the record underwater for the first time she was sifting through my blackberry checking all my messages 
 my brother had a picture of it
  i then announced that i was going to go for sietas ' record  publicly  and
 what he did in response is he went on regis and kelly 
 and broke his old record 
 then his main competitor went out and broke his record so he suddenly pushed the record up to sixteen minutes and thirty two
  which was three minutes longer than i had prepared it was longer than the record
 i wanted to get the science times to document this i wanted to get them to do a piece on it  so  
 i did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do 
 i walked into the new york times offices and did card tricks to everybody 
  i don 't know if it was the magic or the lure of the cayman islands but john tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath holding while he was there i tried to impress him of course and i did a dive down to one hundred and sixty feet which is
 basically the height of a sixteen story building and as i was coming up i blacked out underwater which is really dangerous
  kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up  so  i started full focus
 i completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what i needed to do but there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it being on oprah  
 but
 in practice i would do it face down floating on the pool but for tv they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face basically 
 the other problem
  was
 the the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up so i had to use my legs
 to hold my feet into the straps that were loose which was a real problem for me 
 that made me extremely nervous  raising the heart rate 
 then what they also did was which we never did before is there was a heart rate monitor  and it was right next to the sphere
 every time my heart would 
 the ticking really loud  which was making me more nervous and there was no way to slow my heart rate down 
 normally i would start at thirty eight beats per minute  and while holding my breath it would drop to twelve beats per minute  which is pretty
  this time it started at one hundred and twenty beats  and it never went down  
 i spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down  
 i was just sitting there thinking i 've got to slow this down i 'm going to fail and i was getting more nervous and the heart rate just kept going up and up all the way up to one hundred and fifty beats
  basically it 's the same thing that created my downfall at lincoln center it was a waste of o2 
 when i made it to the halfway mark at eight minutes i was one hundred percent certain that i was not going to be able to make this there was no way for me to do it 
 i figured oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing if i had cracked early it would be a whole show
  how depressed i am 
 so i figured i 'm better off just fighting and staying there until i black out at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that 
 i kept pushing to ten minutes at ten minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes  
 and i knew that that was blood shunting when the blood rushes
  away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs
 at eleven minutes i started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs and my lips started to feel really strange  
 at minute twelve i started to have ringing in my ears  and i started to feel
  a hypochondriac and i remember arm numb means heart attack so i started to really get really paranoid  
 then at thirteen minutes maybe because of the hypochondria  i started feeling
 pains all over my chest  it was awful at fourteen minutes i had these awful contractions like this urge to breathe
  fifteen minutes i was suffering major o2 deprivation to the heart  and i started having ischemia to the heart 
 my heartbeat would go from one hundred and twenty to fifty to one hundred and fifty to forty to twenty to one hundred and fifty again  it would skip a beat 
 it would start it would stop and i felt all this  and i was sure that i was going to have a heart attack
 so at sixteen minutes what i did is i slid my feet out because i knew that if i did go out if i did have a heart attack they 'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet 
  out before pulling me up i was really nervous i let my feet out and i started floating to the top and i didn 't take my head out but i was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop
  and then suddenly i hear screaming  and i think that there is some weird thing that i had died or something had happened  
 and then i realized that i had made it to sixteen thirty two so with the energy of of everybody that was there i decided to keep pushing and i went to seventeen minutes and four seconds
  i did immediately after is i went to quest labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were so the doctors could use it once again  i also didn 't want anybody to question it i had the world record and i wanted to
 make sure it was legitimate  
  and that 's my life so 
 as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible
 and i think magic whether
 i 'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards is pretty simple it 's practice it 's training and it 's it 's
 practice it 's training and experimenting 
 sobs while pushing through the pain to be the best that i can be and  that 's
 that 's what magic is to me
