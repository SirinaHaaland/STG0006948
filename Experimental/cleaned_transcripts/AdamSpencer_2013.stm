  pure mathematics and world debating championships  or as i like to say hello ladies
  didn 't get much sexier than the spence at university let me tell you it is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from sydney australia to be here on the ted stage literally
 on the other side of the world and i wanted to let you know a lot of the things you 've heard about australians are true from the youngest of ages we display a prodigious sporting talent 
 on the field of battle we are
  and noble warriors what you 've heard is true australians we don 't mind a bit of a drink
  sometimes to excess leading to embarrassing social situations this is
 my father 's work christmas party december 
  i 'm almost five years old fair to say i 'm enjoying the day a lot more than santa was but
 i stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host not as a comedian but as someone who was
  is and always will be
 a mathematician 
 and anyone who 's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep  i cast my mind back when i was in second grade
 at a beautiful little government run school called boronia park in the suburbs of sydney  and as we came up towards lunchtime our teacher
  said to the class hey year two  what do you want to do after lunch i 've got no plans it
 was an exercise in democratic schooling  and i am all for democratic schooling but we were only seven 
 so some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical  
 and after a while someone made a particularly silly suggestion and ms russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism that wouldn 't work 
 that 'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole
 't trying to be funny i just politely raised my hand and when ms russell acknowledged me i said in front of my year two classmates  and i quote 
 but miss  
 surely if the diagonal of the square
 is less than the diameter of the circle well the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole
  it 'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop wouldn 't it and there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates until
 sitting next to me one of my friends one of the cool kids in class steven leaned across and punched me really hard in the head 
 now what steven was saying was look adam you are at a critical juncture in your life here my friend you can keep sitting here with us
 any more of that sort of talk you 've got to go and sit over there
 with them 
 i thought about it for a nanosecond i took one look at the road map of life  
 and i ran off down the street marked geek as fast as my chubby  asthmatic little legs would carry me  
 i fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages i explained it
 all my friends maths is beautiful  it 's natural it 's everywhere numbers are the musical notes
 with which the symphony of the universe is written 
 the great descartes said something quite similar the universe is written in the mathematical language and today  i want to show you one of those musical notes a number
 so beautiful
  massive i think it will blow your mind 
 today we 're going to talk about prime numbers most of you i 'm sure remember that six is not prime because it 's two x three 
 seven is prime
 because it 's one x seven but we can 't break it down into any smaller chunks or as we call them  factors  now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers  one is not prime  the proof
  of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties 
 another thing about primes there is no final biggest prime number they keep going on forever we know there are an infinite number 
  of primes due to the brilliant mathematician euclid over thousands of years ago he proved that for us 
 what is the biggest prime that we know about today we 're going to hunt for that massive prime  
 don 't freak out 
 all you need to know of all the mathematics you 've ever learned  unlearned  crammed  forgotten  never understood in the first place
  if you 've got that you 're with me for the entire journey okay  so two ^ five 
  is a prime number  and that five in the power is also a prime number  
 and the vast bulk of massive primes we 've ever found are of that form  two to a prime number  take away one  i won 't go into great detail as to why because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if i do
  suffice to say a number of that form is fairly easy to test
 for primacy a random odd number is a lot harder to test 
 but as soon as we go hunting for massive primes we realize it 's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power
 one = two thousand and forty seven and you don 't need me to tell you
  prime numbers after that point they thin out a lot 
 and one of the things about the search for massive primes that i love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search this is the great swiss mathematician leonhard euler 
 in the  1700s other mathematicians said he is simply the master
  he was so respected they put him on european currency back when that was a compliment 
 euler discovered at the time the world 's biggest prime two 
  one it 's over two billion  he proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill ink paper and his mind
  but one of the great things about the search for massive primes it 's not just finding the primes  
  digits long was not prime  
 but he didn 't know what the factors were 
 we knew it was like six but we didn 't know what are the two x three that multiply together to give us that massive number we didn 't know for almost forty years until frank nelson cole came along 
  a gathering of prestigious american mathematicians he walked to the board took up a piece of chalk  and started writing out the powers of two 
 sixteen come on join in with me you know how it goes
 powers of two  he took away one and wrote that number on the board a frisson of excitement went around the room
  it got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format and for the rest of the hour of his talk
 frank nelson cole busted that out
  he had found the prime factors of two 
 the room went berserk 
 as frank nelson cole sat down having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words  
 he admitted afterwards it wasn 't that hard to do it took focus  it took dedication  it took him by his estimate
 years of sundays 
 but then in the field of mathematics as in so many of the fields that we 've heard from in this ted  
 the age of the computer goes along and things explode  
 these are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade each one dwarfing the one before as
 computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew this is the largest prime number we 
 a very emotional year for me 
 it was the year i left university  i was torn between mathematics and media  it was a tough decision i loved university 
 my arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life 
 but i came to a realization about my own ability put simply in a room full of randomly selected people
  i 'm a maths genius in a roomful of maths ph ds i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers 
 my skill is not in the mathematics it is in telling the story of the mathematics 
 and during that time since i 've left university these numbers have got bigger and bigger  each one dwarfing the last until
  curtis cooper 
 who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime 
 only to see it snatched away by a rival university  and then curtis cooper got it back 
 not years ago not months ago  
 days ago in an amazing moment of serendipity i had to send ted a new slide
 to show you what this guy had done  i still remember
 i still remember when it happened i was doing my breakfast radio show i looked down on twitter there was a tweet adam have you seen the new largest prime number i shivered 
 contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room and said girls hold the front page  
 we 're not talking politics today we 're not talking sport today  they
  the girls just shook their heads  put them in their hands  and let me go my own way it 's because of curtis cooper that we know  
 currently the largest prime number we know is two
 eight hundred and
  one hundred and sixty one don 't forget to subtract the one  this number is almost seventeen and a half
  if you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file that 's
 meg for the slightly less geeky of you think about the harry potter novels okay  this is the first harry potter novel 
 this is all seven harry potter novels because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end 
 written out as a book
  this number would run the length of the harry potter novels and half again  
 here 's a slide of the first one thousand digits of this prime  
 if when ted had begun at eleven o 'clock on tuesday we 'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second  it would have taken five hours to show you that number 
 i was keen to do it could not convince bono  that 's the way
  this number is seventeen and a half thousand slides long  and we know it is prime
 as confidently as we know the number seven is prime 
 that fills me with almost sexual excitement  
 and who am i kidding when i say almost 
 i know what you 're thinking
  we 're happy
 that you 're happy  
 but why should we care  
 let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful first of all as i explained to ask a computer is that number prime to type it in its abbreviated form  
 and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy is a remarkably simple question to ask 
 it 's got a remarkably clear yes no answer
  and just requires phenomenal grunt 
 large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips  but secondly as curtis cooper was looking for that monster prime he wasn 't the only guy searching 
 my laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large
  the discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling rna sequences in searching through data from seti and other astronomical projects we live in an age
 where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia
 but on laptops  desktops in the palms of people 's hands who are simply helping out for the search  
 but for me it 's amazing because it 's a metaphor for the time in which we live 
 when human minds and machines can conquer
 together  we 've heard a lot about robots in this ted we 've heard a lot about what they can and can 't do it is true you can now download onto your smartphone an app
 that would beat most grandmasters at chess you think that 's cool here 's a machine doing something cool this is the cubestormer ii 
 it can take a randomly shuffled
  using the power of the smartphone  it can examine the cube and solve the cube
 in five seconds 
 that scares some people  that excites me  
 how lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together  i was asked in an interview
  last year in my capacity as a lower case c celebrity in australia what was your highlight of two thousand and twelve 
 people were expecting me to talk about my beloved sydney swans football team  
 in our beautiful  indigenous sport of australian football they won the equivalent of the super bowl  i was there it was the most emotional exciting day  it wasn 't my highlight of two thousand and twelve 
 people thought it might have been an interview i 'd done on my show it might have been a politician it might have been a breakthrough it might have been a book i read
  the arts no no no it might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done no it wasn 't the highlight of two thousand and twelve so clearly 
 was the discovery of the higgs boson 
 give it up for the fundamental particle
 that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass and
 what was so gorgeous about this discovery was fifty years ago peter higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions
 how is it that
 the things that make us up have no mass  i 've clearly got mass  
 where does it come from and he postulated a suggestion that there 's this infinite 
 incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe  and as other particles go through those particles and interact  that 's where they get their mass  the rest of the scientific community said
  higgsy  we 've got no idea if we could ever prove it it 's beyond our reach and within just fifty years 
 in his lifetime with him sitting in the audience  
 we had designed the greatest machine ever
 to prove this incredible idea that originated
  that 's what is so exciting for me about this prime number we thought it might be there  
 and we went and found it 
 that is the essence of being human 
 that is what we are all about or as my friend descartes might put it we think
