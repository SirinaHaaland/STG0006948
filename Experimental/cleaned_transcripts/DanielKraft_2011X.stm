  couple of years ago when i was attending the ted conference in long beach 
 i met harriet we 'd actually met online before not the way you 're thinking we were introduced because we both knew linda avey one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with linda
 she could see that harriet and i shared a very rare type of mitochondrial dna haplotype 
  which meant we were distantly related we actually share the same genealogy with tzi the iceman so tzi harriet and me and
 being the current day of course we started our own facebook group you 're all welcome to join  when i met harriet in person the next year at the ted conference
  she 'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t shirts 
 why am i telling you this story what does it have to do with the future of health well the way i met harriet is an example of how leveraging cross disciplinary exponentially 
  growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics to the connection of the internet and social networking  
  if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day two four eight sixteen in fifteen days you 'd have thirty two thousand what do you think you 'd have in a month we 're at a billion 
 if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us many of these technologies  speaking as a physician and innovator we can start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care and to address many of the major challenges
  today ranging from the exponential costs to the aging population  the way we really don 't use information very well today  the fragmentation of care and the often very difficult course of adoption of innovation  
 and one of the major things we can do 
  the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last twenty percent of life what if we could incentivize physicians in the health care system and our own selves to move the curve to the left and improve our health leveraging
  technology as well now my favorite example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket 
 if you think about it these are really dramatically improving i mean  this is the iphone four imagine what the iphone eight will be able to do 
 now  i 've gained some insight into this i 've been the track share for the medicine
 portion of a new institution called
  based in silicon valley  we bring together each summer about one hundred very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space 
 and address how we can cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven day executive programs and coming up next month is futuremed a program to help
 cross train and leverage technologies into medicine  now  i mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over twenty thousand different mobile apps available
 there 's one out of the uk where you can pee on a little chip connect it to your iphone and check for an std i don 't know if i 'd try that but it 's available
 there are other sorts of applications merging your phone and diagnostics for example  measuring your blood glucose on your iphone and sending that to your physician  so they can better understand and you can better understand 
 your blood sugars as a diabetic  so let 's see how exponential technologies are taking health care let 's start with faster
  that computers through moore 's law are speeding up faster and faster we can do more powerful things with them they 're really approaching in many cases surpassing the ability of the human mind  but where i think computational speed is most applicable is in imaging  
 the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible and we 're layering multiple
  molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels 
 here you 're going to see the very highest resolution mri scan done today 
 of marc hodosh the curator of tedmed  and now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability never before available  and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even
 reengineer
 or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand
  in the brain at real time and by understanding these sorts of processes and these connections we 're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective for example  psychoactive drugs 
 the scanners for these are getting smaller less expensive and more portable 
 and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge  the scan of today takes up about eight hundred books or twenty gigabytes the scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte or eight
  hundred thousand books how do you leverage that information  
 let 's get personal i won 't ask who here 's had a colonoscopy but if you 're over age fifty it 's time for your screening colonoscopy  how 'd you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick  now there 's essentially virtual colonoscopy
  compare those two pictures as a radiologist you can basically fly through your patient 's colon and augmenting that with artificial intelligence 
  a lesion that we might have missed but using ai on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn 't have otherwise
 this is an example of this paradigm shift we 're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and i would say mobile now this era of digital medicine even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there 's an app for that 
 we 're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope
 these are now at a price point of what used to be one hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars i can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand
 merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the us we 're still less than twenty percent electronic here in the netherlands i think it 's more than eighty percent now that we 're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can
  data from wherever i am just through my mobile device  
 and now of course we 're in the era of the ipad even the ipad two just last month the first fda approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual
 reading on these sorts of devices  
 so certainly the physicians of today including myself are completely reliable on these devices  and as you saw just about a month ago  watson from ibm beat the two champions in jeopardy so i want you to imagine when in a couple of years
  to apply this cloud based information  when we really have the ai physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never
 done 
 already today you don 't need to go to your physician in many cases only in about twenty percent of visits do you need to lay hands on the patient  we 're now in the era of virtual visits from skype type visits you can do with american well
  to cisco that 's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your health care provider is different and these are being augmented even by our devices again today my friend jessica sent me a picture of her head 
  laceration  so i can save her a trip to the emergency room and do diagnostics that way or maybe we can leverage today 's gaming technology like the microsoft kinect hack that to enable diagnostics for example in diagnosing stroke  using simple motion detection using $ one hundred
 these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now we already have wireless scales you step on the scale tweet your weight to your friends they can keep you in line 
 we have wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of technologies are being put together instead of wearing kludgy devices we put on a simple patch this was developed
  completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity
 we 're also in the era today of quantified self consumers now can basically buy $ one hundred devices like this little fitbit  i can measure my steps my caloric outtake  i can get insight into that on a daily basis and share it with my friends or physician  
 there 's watches that measure your heart rate zeo sleep monitors a suite of tools that enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health as we start to integrate this information we 'll know better what to do with it
  insight into our own pathologies health and wellness  there 's even mirrors that can pick up your pulse rate and i would argue in the future we 'll have wearable devices in our clothes 
  seven and just like the onstar system in cars your red light might go on
  for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like a wireless diaper that
 supports your more information i think than you might need but it
 's going to be here 
 now we 've heard a lot today about technology and connection and i think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients to take more time and  do the important human touch elements of
  how about augmenting the physician  we 're now in the era of 
  the surgeon who can now go into the body and do robotic surgery which is here today at a level that was not really possible even five years ago  and now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like 
 augmented reality  so the surgeon can see inside the patient  through their lens  where the tumor is where the blood vessels are
  this can be integrated with decision support a surgeon in new york can help a surgeon in amsterdam for example  and we 're entering an era of truly scarless surgery called notes where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way
 and robotically  this is called notes and it 's coming basically scarless surgery as mediated by robotic surgery  
 now  how about controlling other elements for those who have disabilities the
  where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients  and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair or potentially a robotic arm these devices are getting smaller and going 
  into more and more of these patients still in clinical trials but imagine when we can connect these for example to the amazing bionic limb such as the deka arm  built by dean kamen and colleagues which has seventeen degrees of motion 
  and freedom and can allow the person who 's lost a limb to have much higher dexterity or control than they 've
  had in the past so we 're really entering the era of
 wearable robotics actually if you haven 't lost a limb but had a stroke you can wear these augmented limbs or if you 're a paraplegic i 've visited the folks at berkeley bionics they 've developed elegs 
 i took this video last week here 's a paraplegic patient  walking by strapping on these exoskeletons he 's otherwise completely wheelchair bound this is the early era of wearable robotics  and by leveraging these sorts of technologies
  to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability or super enabling this is aimee mullins who lost her lower limbs as a young child and hugh herr  who 's a professor at mit 
 who lost his limbs in a climbing accident  and now both of them can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics
  the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction including with huge costs 
 but the trend in medicine is to get exponentially smaller a few examples we 're now in the era of fantastic voyage the ipill you can swallow this completely integrated device it can take pictures of your 
  gi system help diagnose and treat as it moves through your gi tract we get into even smaller micro robots that will eventually  autonomously move through your system  and be able to do things surgeons can 't do in a much less invasive manner  sometimes these might
  and be augmented in that reality on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so no need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they 'll be wirelessly telemetered 
  to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely these are shrinking even further this one is in prototyping by medtronic it 's smaller than a penny  
  the ability to put arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see also in early trials  but moving into the future these are going to be game changing or for those of us who are sighted  how about having the 
 assisted living contact lens  bluetooth wi fi available beams back images to your eye now  
  the pathologist to use their cell phone to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics in fact  the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing 
  we can now leverage microfluidics like this chip made by steve quake at stanford microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians put it on a chip enable thousands of tests at the point of care 
 anywhere in the world this will really leverage technology to the rural and the underserved and enable what used to be thousand dollar tests to be done for pennies and at the point of care
  if we go down the small pathway a little bit further  we 're entering the era of nanomedicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that monitor 
  our blood system or immune system or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries now how about exponentially cheaper  not something we usually think about in the era of medicine but hard disks used to be
  four hundred dollars for ten megabytes
 exponentially cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we 're now approaching essentially a $ one thousand genome probably next year and in two years a $
  one hundred genome what will we do with $ one hundred genomes soon we 'll have millions of these tests available then it gets interesting when we start to crowd source
  which don 't work for the individual many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches i 'll show you a simple example from 23andme again my data indicates i 've got about average risk 
  for developing macular degeneration a kind of blindness  but if i take that same data upload it to decodeme  i can look at my risk for type two diabetes  i 'm at almost twice the risk  i might want to watch how much dessert i have at lunch  for example it might change my behavior 
  my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics how my genes modulate 
 what my drugs do and what doses i need will become increasingly important  and once in the hands of  individuals and patients will make better drug dosing and selection available 
 so again it 's not just genes it 's multiple details our habits our environmental exposures when was the last time your doctor asked where you 've lived  geomedicine where you live what you 've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information
  genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as physicians how do we manage it we 're now entering the era of systems medicine systems biology where we can start to integrate 
  all this information  and by looking at the patterns for example in our blood of ten thousand biomarkers in a single test we can look at patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage  this is called by lee hood the father of the field
  and know what you 're likely to have we can be preventative that prevention can be personalized more importantly it 'll be increasingly participatory through websites like patientslikeme or managing your data on
  microsoft healthvault or google health leveraging this together in participatory ways will be increasingly important i
 that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy 
 basically cure hypertension  this is a new device doing essentially that it should be on the market in a year or two  
 how about more targeted therapies for cancer i 'm an oncologist and know that most of what we give is essentially poison 
 we learned at stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells the ones that seem to be really responsible for
 disease relapse so if you think of cancer as a weed  we often can whack the weed
  away and it seems to shrink but it often comes back so we 're attacking the wrong target the cancer stem cells remain and the tumor can return months or years later  we 're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure 
 we 're entering the era of personalized oncology  the ability to leverage all of this data together  analyze the tumor and come up with a
  specific cocktail for the individual patient i
 'll close with regenerative medicine i 've studied a lot about stem cells 
 embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful we have adult stem cells throughout our body we use those in bone marrow transplantation  
 geron last year started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries still a phase i trial  but evolving  we 've been using adult stem cells in clinical trials for about fifteen years to approach a whole
  we take our own bone marrow cells
 and treat a patient with a heart attack  we can see much improved heart function and better survival using our own bone marrow derived cells after a heart attack  
 i invented a device called the marrowminer a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it 's now been fda approved hopefully on the market in the next year 
 hopefully you can appreciate the device going through the patient 's body removing bone marrow not with two hundred punctures  
  if you think about it every cell in your body has the same dna you had when you were an embryo  we can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell
  and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in the same patient making personalized stem cell lines i think there 'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells
  myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future  should you need them 
 we 're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering  and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building 
 and reconstructing a 3d organ that 's where things are heading still very early days but i think as integration of exponential technologies  this is the example  
 entering an era of miniaturization  decentralization and personalization  and by pulling these things together if we start to think about how to understand and leverage them we 're going to empower the patient  enable 
  the doctor  enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick  because i know as a doctor if someone comes to me with stage i disease i 'm thrilled we can often cure them  but often 
 it 's too late and it 's stage iii or iv cancer for example  so by leveraging these technologies together  i think we 'll enter a new era that i like to call stage zero medicine
 and as a cancer doctor  i 'm looking forward to being out of a job  thanks very much
