  a year ago  we were invited by the swiss embassy in berlin to present our art projects 
 we are used to invitations  but this invitation really thrilled us 
 the swiss embassy in berlin is special it is the only old building in the government district that was not
  destroyed during the second world war and it sits right next to the federal chancellery 
 no one is closer to chancellor merkel than the swiss diplomats 
 the government district in berlin
 also contains the reichstag germany 's parliament and the brandenburg gate and right next to the gate there are other embassies in particular
 the us and the british
  embassy  
 although germany is an advanced democracy  
 citizens are limited in their constitutional rights in its government district 
 the right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there 
 and this is interesting from an artistic point of view
 the opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order
  order and always subject to a specific regulation 
 with an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations we can gain a new perspective 
 the given terms and conditions shape our perception our actions
 and our lives and this is crucial in another
  over the last couple of years  we learned that from the roofs of the us and the british embassy  
 the secret services have been listening to the entire district  
 including the mobile phone of angela merkel 
 the antennas of the british gchq are hidden in a white cylindrical radome 
 while the listening post of the american nsa is covered by radio transparent
  but how to address these hidden and disguised forces  with my colleague  christoph wachter  we accepted the invitation of the swiss embassy  
 and we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation
 if people are spying on us it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying 
 on the roof of the swiss embassy  we installed
  a series of antennas 
 they weren 't as sophisticated as those used by the americans and the british 
 they were makeshift can antennas not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible
  the academy of arts joined the project  and so we built another large antenna
  never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation 
 a helicopter circled over our heads with a camera registering each and every move we made 
 and on the roof of the us embassy security officers patrolled  
 although the government district is governed
 by a strict police order there are no specific laws relating
  relating to digital communication our installation was therefore perfectly legal and the swiss ambassador informed chancellor merkel about it 
 we named the project can you hear me 
 laughter the antennas created an open and free wi fi communication network
 in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate using any
  without any hindrance and be able to send messages to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted
  text messages  voice chat  file sharing anything could be sent
 anonymously and people did communicate over fifteen thousand messages were sent
  this is the nsa in god we trust all others we track
  the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network
  and to our surprise they did 
 files appeared on the network  including classified documents leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information is starting to become difficult  even for members of a parliament 
 we also organized guided tours to experience and sound out
  tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication  
 if we become aware
 of the constellation the terms and conditions of communication it not only broadens our horizon it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview 
  let 's look at an actual example  
 the fate of people living in the makeshift settlements on the outskirts of paris is hidden and faded from view  
 it 's a vicious circle  it 's not poverty not racism not exclusion that are new what is new
 is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange
 such makeshift settlements are considered illegal and therefore those living in them don 't have a chance of making their voices heard 
 on the contrary every time they appear every time they risk becoming visible  merely gives grounds
 for further persecution expulsion and suppression what interested us
 was how we could come to know this hidden side we were searching for an
  interface
 and we found one  it 's not a digital interface  but a physical one  it 's a hotel  we named the project hotel gelem 
 together with roma families we created several hotel gelems in europe for example in freiburg in germany in montreuil near paris 
 and also in the balkans these are real hotels people can stay there  
 but they aren 't a commercial enterprise they are a symbol
  you can go online
 and ask for a personal invitation to come and live for a few days in the hotel gelem in their homes  eating  working and living with the roma families 
 here the roma families are not the travelers the visitors are 
 here  the roma families are not a minority
  the visitors are 
 the point is
 not to make judgments  but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions 
 in the world of globalization  
 the continents are drifting closer to each other cultures goods and people are in permanent exchange  but at the same time the gap between the world of the privileged and the world of the excluded
 is growing
  recently in australia for us  it was no problem to enter the country we have european passports visas and air tickets  but asylum seekers
 who arrive by boat in australia are deported or taken to prison the interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system
 are veiled by the australian authorities these procedures are declared to be secret military operations
 after dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones  men women and children are detained by australia without trial sometimes for years  
 during our stay however  we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned despite strict screening and
  from these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the queensland university of technology in brisbane 
 on the face of it  it was a very simple installation 
 on the floor a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility 
 but the exhibition step
 came in the form of connectivity  above every floor marking there was a
  headset 
 visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee who was or had been imprisoned in a specific detention facility and engage in a personal conversation 
 in the protected context of the art exhibition asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves their story
  without fear of consequences 
 visitors immersed themselves in long conversations about families torn apart about dramatic escapes from war zones about suicide attempts about the fate of children in detention 
 emotions ran deep many wept several revisited the exhibition  it was a powerful experience 
 europe
 is now facing
 a stream of migrants  the situation for the asylum seekers
  is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation
 of militarized responses  
 we have also established communication systems in remote refugee centers in switzerland and greece  
 they are all about providing basic information weather forecasts legal information guidance  
 but they are significant information on the internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being
  censored and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized 
 this brings us back to our network and to the antennas on the roof of the swiss embassy in berlin
 and the can you hear me project  we should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected we should start making our own connections fighting
 for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world this is
  essential to overcome our 
 and the separation provoked by rival political forces  it is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience
 that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion thank you
  me just a detail the name of the hotel is not a random name gelem means something specific in the roma language
 you two traveled to the island of lesbos very recently you 're just back a couple of days ago in greece where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last
 few months what did you see there and what did you do there christoph wachter 
 well lesbos is one of the greek islands close to turkey  and during our stay many asylum seekers arrived by boat
 on
 overcrowded dinghies  and after landing
  they were left completely on their own  they are
 denied many services for example they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room so many families
 literally sleep in the streets  and we installed networks there to allow basic communication  
 because i think i believe it 's
 not only that we have to
 speak about the refugees i think
 we need to start talking to them 
 and by doing so we can realize that it is about human beings about their lives and their struggle to survive bg and allow them to talk as well  christoph thank you for coming to
