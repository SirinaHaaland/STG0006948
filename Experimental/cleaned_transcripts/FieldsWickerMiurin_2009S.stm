  i 'm going to talk about
 some of my discoveries around the world through my work  
 these are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science they 're discoveries of people
 and the way people are and new leadership
  this is benki benki is a leader of the ashaninka nation his people live in brazil and in peru 
 benki comes from a village so remote
 up in the amazon that to get there either you have to fly and land on water  or go by canoe for several days
  i met benki three years ago in sao paulo when i 'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples
 to meet with me and leaders from around the world  because we wanted to learn from each other we wanted to share our stories
 with each other the ashaninka people are known throughout south america
 for their dignity their spirit and their resistance  starting with the incas
 and continuing through the  19th century with the rubber
  tappers  
 today 's biggest threat to the ashaninka people and to benki comes from illegal logging the
 people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees  
 float them down the river to world markets 
 benki knew this he could see what was happening to his forest to his environment because he was taken under his grandfather
  's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest
 and the way of life of his people 
 his grandfather died when he was only ten 
 and at that young age  ten years old benki became the paje of his community  now in the ashaninka tradition
  is the most important person in the community  this is the person who contains within him all the knowledge all the wisdom
 of centuries and centuries of life 
 and not just about his people but about everything that his people 's survival depended on 
 the trees the birds  the water  the soil the forest so when he was only ten
 and he became the paje he began to lead his people
 he began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect the way of life they needed to nurture 
 he explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest 
 it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive
 and to protect that eight years later when he was a young man of eighteen benki left the forest for the first time
 he went three thousand miles on an odyssey to rio to the earth summit
 to tell the world what was happening in his tiny little corner  
 and he went because he hoped the world would listen some did not everybody  
 but if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe learning a new language portuguese not to mention english
  going to rio 
 building a bridge to reach out to people he 'd never met before a pretty hostile world  
 but he wasn 't dismayed benki came back to his village
 full of ideas
 new technologies new research new ways of understanding what was going on 
 since that time he 's continued to work with his people and not only the ashaninka nation
  but all the peoples of the amazon and beyond  he 's built schools to teach children to care for the forest  
 together he 's led the reforestation of over twenty five percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers  
 he 's created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods  and he 's brought the
  and satellite technology to the forest
 both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation but also that he could speak from the forest
 to the rest of the world
  if you were to meet benki and ask him why are you doing this  why are you putting yourself at risk 
 why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world 
 he would tell
  what did my grandparents and my 
 do
 to protect the forest for me and what am i doing 
 so when i think of that i wonder what our grandchildren and our 
 when they ask themselves that question  i wonder how they will answer for me the world is veering towards
  a future
 we don 't much want when we really think about it deep inside it 's a future we don 't know the details of 
 but it 's a future that has signs just like benki saw the signs around him 
 we know we are running out of what we need  
 we 're running out of fresh water  we 're running out of fossil fuels  we 're running out of land we know climate change is
  going to affect all of us we don 't know how but we know it will  
 and we know that there will be more of us than ever before five times as many people in forty years than sixty years ago  
 we are running out of what we need  
 and we also know
 that the world has changed in other ways that since one thousand nine hundred and
  as many new countries
 that exist as independent entities on the planet egos systems of government figuring it out
 massive change and in addition to that we know that five other really big countries
 are going to have a say in the future a say we haven 't even really started to hear yet
 china india 
  south africa
 and benki 's own brazil  where benki got his civil rights only in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight constitution 
 but you know all that you know more than benki knew when he left his forest
 and went three thousand miles 
 you also know that we can 't just keep doing what we 've always done because we 'll get the results we 've always gotten 
 and this reminds me of something i understand lord salisbury said to queen victoria
 over a hundred years ago when she was pressing him please change he said change  why change  
 things are bad enough as they are 
 we have to change  it 's imperative to me when i look around the world  that
  we need to change ourselves we need new models of what it means to be a leader we need new models
 of being a leader and a human in the world  
 i started life as a banker  now i don 't admit to that
 to anybody but my very close friends
  but for the past eight years i 've done something completely different my work has taken me around the world  where i 've had
 the real privilege of meeting people like benki
 and many others who are making change happen in their communities
 people who see the world differently who are asking different questions who have different answers  who understand the filters that they wear
 when they go out into the world  
 this is sanghamitra sanghamitra comes from bangalore  i met sanghamitra eight years ago when i was in bangalore
  organizing a workshop with leaders of different ngo 's working in some of the hardest aspects of society 
 sanghamitra didn 't start life as a leader of an ngo she started her career as university professor  
 teaching english literature  but she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that she loved it but she was too detached 
 she decided to start a new organization called samraksha
 focused on one of the hardest areas one of the hardest issues in india anywhere in the world at the time
 hiv aids  since that time samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health ngo
  but if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of hiv aids in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three
 in india at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why and everyone was actually very very afraid 
 today there are still three million
 people in india that 's the second largest population in the world  
 when i asked sanghamitra how did you get from english literature
 to hiv aids
  not an obvious path she said to me it 's all connected  
 literature makes one sensitive sensitive to people to their dreams
 and to their ideas since that time under her leadership  samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to hiv
  they have respite homes the first the first care centers the first counseling services and not just in urban
  bangalore  but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of karnataka  
 even that wasn 't enough she wanted to change policy at the government level  
 ten of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government 
  people today
 in over one thousand villages around karnataka  she works with people like murali krishna 
 murali krishna comes from one of those villages  he lost his wife to aids a couple of years ago  and he 's hiv positive 
 but he saw the work  the care the compassion
 that sanghamitra and her team brought to the village and he wanted to be part of it he 's a leaders ' quest fellow and that helps him with his work they 've pioneered a different
  approach to villages instead of handing out information in pamphlets as is so often the case  
 they bring theater troupes  songs music dance  
 and they sit around and they talk about dreams sanghamitra told me just last week she had just come back from two weeks in the villages  and she had a real
  they were sitting in a circle talking about the dreams for the village and the young women in the village
 spoke up and said we 've changed our dream our dream
 is for our partners our husbands not to be given to us because of a horoscope  
 but to be given to us because they 've been tested for hiv 
 if you are lucky enough to meet sanghamitra
 and ask her why and how how have you
  achieved so much 
 she would look at you and very quietly very softly say it just happened 
 it 's the spirit inside 
 this is dr fan jianchuan jianchuan comes from sichuan province in
  and you can imagine what his childhood looked like and felt like and what his life has been like over the last fifty tumultuous years  
 he 's been a soldier a teacher 
 a politician a vice mayor and a business man but if you sat down and asked him who are you really  and what do you do he would tell you 
  and i curate a museum i was lucky i had heard about him for years and i finally met him earlier this year at his museum
 in chengdu  
 he 's been a collector all of his life  starting when he was four or five in the early one thousand nine hundred and sixty 's now just think of the early one thousand nine hundred and sixty 's in china 
 over a lifetime  through everything through the cultural revolution and everything afterward  he 's kept collecting 
 so that he now has over eight million pieces
 in his museums documenting contemporary chinese history  
 these are pieces that you won 't find anywhere else in the world in part because they document parts of history
 chinese choose to forget 
 for example  he 's got over one million pieces documenting the  sino japanese war a war that 's not talked about in china very much
 and whose heroes are not honored
  why did he do all this because he thought
 a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past so from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues
 of the heroes of the sino japanese war including those chinese
 who then fought with each other and left mainland china to go to taiwan to commemorating
 all the unknown  ordinary soldiers who survived by asking them to take prints of their hands  he is making sure one man
 is making sure that history is not forgotten  
 but it 's not just chinese heroes he cares about this building contains the world 's largest collection of documents and artifacts
  in fighting on the chinese side in that long war
 the flying tigers  he has nine other buildings that are already open to the public
 filled to the rafters with artifacts
 documenting contemporary chinese history two
 of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the cultural revolution 
 a period that actually most chinese would prefer to forget
 but he doesn 't want his nation ever
 to forget  these people inspire me  and they inspire me because they show us
 what is possible
 when you change the way you look at the world  change the way you look at your place
 in the world  they looked outside and then they changed what was on the inside  they didn 't go to business school they didn
  a manual how to be a good leader in ten easy steps but they have qualities we 'd all recognize  they have drive passion commitment 
 they 've gone away from what they did before  
 and they 've gone to something they didn 't know they 've tried to connect worlds
 they didn 't know existed before they 've built bridges  and they 've
  walked across them  they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it they know people have come before them and will follow them 
 and they know that they 're part of a whole that they depend on other people 
 it 's not about them  they know that but it has to start with them and they have humility
  but we know it doesn 't just happen don 't we we know it takes a lot to make it happen  and we know the direction the world is going in so i think we need
 succession planning on a global basis  
 we can 't wait for the next generation the new joiners to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need i think it has to start with us 
 and we know just like they knew how hard it
  but the good news is that we don 't have to figure it out as we go along we have models we have examples like benki and sanghamitra and jianchuan  
 we can look at what they 've done if we look we can learn from what they 've learned  
 we can change
 the way we see ourselves in the world and if we 're lucky  we can change the way
 will answer benki 's question thank you
