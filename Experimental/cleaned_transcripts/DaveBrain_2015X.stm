  to be here  i 'm glad you 're here  because that would be a little weird 
 i 'm glad we 're all here  and by here i don 't mean here 
  mean those of us in this auditorium  but life all life on earth 
 from complex to single celled from mold to mushrooms to flying bears laughter
  the interesting thing is earth is the only place we know of that has life
 eight point seven million species  
 we 've looked other places maybe not as hard as we should or we could but we 've looked and haven 't found any earth is the only place we know of with life 
 is earth special  
 this is a question i 've wanted to know the answer to since i was a small child and i suspect eighty percent of this auditorium has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer
 to understand whether there are any planets out there in our solar system or beyond that can support life 
 the first step is to understand what life here requires 
 it turns out of all of those eight point seven million species life only needs three things 
 on one side all life on earth needs energy complex life like us derives our energy from the sun  but life deep underground can get
  its energy from things like chemical reactions there are a number of different energy sources available on all planets on the other side all life needs food
 or nourishment  and this seems like a tall order especially if you want a succulent tomato 
 however all life on earth derives its nourishment from only six chemical elements and these elements can be found on any planetary body
  in our solar system so that leaves the thing in the middle
 as the tall pole the thing that 's hardest to achieve not moose  but water 
 although moose would be pretty cool and not frozen  water and not water in a gaseous state
  this is what life needs to survive all life and many solar system bodies don 't have liquid water  and so we don 't look there
 other solar system bodies might have abundant liquid water even more than earth  but it 's trapped beneath an icy shell  
 and so it 's hard to access it 's hard to get to it 's hard to even find out if there 's any life there 
 so that leaves a few bodies that we should think about  so let 's make the problem simpler for ourselves let 's think only about
  liquid water on the surface of a planet there are only three bodies to think about in our solar system with regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet  and in order of distance from the sun it 's venus 
 earth and mars
 you want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid you have to be very careful with that atmosphere you can 't have too much atmosphere
  too thick or too warm an atmosphere because then you end up too hot
 like venus and you can 't have liquid water but if you have too little atmosphere and it 's too thin and too cold you end up like mars too cold  
 so venus is too hot mars is too cold and earth is just right you can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically where life can survive in our solar system  
 it 's a
  and it 's so simple that a child could understand it  however  i 'd like to remind you
 of two things from the goldilocks story that we may not think about so often but that i think are really relevant here  number one 
 if mama bear 's bowl is too cold
 when goldilocks walks into the room  does that mean it 's always been too cold or could it have been just right at some other time
 when goldilocks walks into the room
 determines the answer that we get in the story  
 and the same is true with planets they 're not static things they change  they vary they evolve  and atmospheres do the same 
 so let me give you an example here 's one of my favorite pictures of mars it 's not the highest resolution image it 's not the sexiest image
  it 's not the most recent image  but it 's an image that shows riverbeds cut into the surface of the planet  riverbeds carved by flowing liquid water  
 riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form 
 this can 't happen on mars today the atmosphere of mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid  this one image tells you that the atmosphere of mars
  and it changed in big ways  
 and it changed from a state that we would define as habitable because the three requirements for life were present long ago 
 where did that atmosphere go
 that allowed water to be liquid at the surface well one idea is it escaped away to space atmospheric particles got enough energy to break free from the gravity of the
  escaping away to space never to return  and this happens with all bodies with atmospheres comets have tails that are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape  
 but venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time and mars and earth as well it 's just a matter of degree and a matter of scale  
 so we 'd like to figure out how much escaped over time  so we can explain this transition 
 how do atmospheres get their energy for escape how do particles get enough energy to escape there are two ways if we
  to reduce things a little bit number one sunlight  light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles
 yes i 'm dancing but they oh my god
 not even at my wedding laughter
 they get enough energy to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet just by warming a second way they can get energy is from the solar wind
  are particles mass material 
 spit out from the surface of the sun and they go screaming through the solar system at four hundred kilometers per second sometimes faster during solar storms  and they go hurtling through interplanetary 
  space towards planets and their atmospheres  and they may provide energy for atmospheric particles to escape as
  this is something that i 'm interested in because it relates to habitability 
 i mentioned that there were two things about the goldilocks story that i wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about and the second one is a little bit more subtle 
 if papa bear 's bowl
 is too hot  and mama bear 's bowl
 is too cold  shouldn 't baby bear 's bowl be even colder if we 're following the trend
  this thing that you 've accepted your entire life when you think about it a little bit more may not be so simple 
 and of course distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature this has to play into habitability  but maybe there are other things we should be thinking about maybe it 's the bowls themselves that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story
  what is just right
 i could talk to you about a lot of different characteristics of these three planets that may influence habitability  but for selfish reasons related to my own research and the fact that i 'm standing up here holding the clicker and you 're not 
 i would like to talk for just a minute or two about magnetic fields 
 earth has one venus and mars do not magnetic fields are generated in the deep
 interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds earth if you have a compass you know which way north is 
 venus and mars don 't have that if you have a compass on venus and mars congratulations you 're lost 
 does this influence habitability well
 how might it 
 many scientists think that a magnetic field of a planet serves as a shield for the atmosphere  deflecting solar wind particles around the planet
 in a bit of a force field type effect having to do with electric charge of those particles 
 i like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets 
 and yes my colleagues who watch this later will realize this is the first time in the history of our community that the solar wind has been equated with mucus
  is that earth may have been protected for billions of years because we 've had a magnetic field atmosphere hasn 't been able to escape mars on the other hand has been unprotected because of its lack of magnetic field and over billions of years 
 maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away to account for a transition from a habitable planet
 to the planet that we see today other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the
  sails on a ship  
 enabling the planet to to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself 
 the sails may gather energy from the solar wind the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen 
 it 's an idea that has to be
  the effect and how it works seems apparent  that 's because we know energy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere here on earth that energy is conducted along magnetic field 
  lines down into the polar regions resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora if you 've ever experienced them it 's magnificent 
  this in any way so i
 've posed a problem for you here but i don 't have a solution yet we don 't have a solution  
 but we 're working on it how are we working on it well we 've sent spacecraft to all three planets some of them are orbiting now  including the maven spacecraft which is currently orbiting mars 
 which i 'm involved with and which is led here out of the university of colorado  
  we have similar measurements from venus and earth
 once we have all our measurements we can combine all these together  and we can understand how all three planets interact with their space environment with the surroundings and we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for habitability
 or not  once we have that answer why should you care  i mean i care deeply  and financially as well but deeply
  an answer to this question will teach us more about these three planets venus earth and mars not only about how they interact with their environment today  but how they were billions of years ago 
 whether they were habitable long ago or not it will teach us about atmospheres that surround us and that are close  
 but moreover what we learn from these planets can be applied to atmospheres everywhere  
 including planets that we 're now observing around other stars for example the kepler spacecraft which is
  which is built and controlled here in boulder has been observing a postage  stamp sized region of the sky for a couple years now and it 's found thousands of planets
 in one postage stamp sized region of the sky that we don 't think is any different from any other part
 of the sky  we 've gone in twenty years from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system to now having so many that we don
  't know which ones to investigate first any lever will help 
 in fact 
 based on observations that kepler 's taken and other similar observations we now believe that of the two hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy alone 
  every star has at least one planet 
 in addition to that estimates suggest there are somewhere between forty billion and one hundred billion of those planets that we would define as habitable
 in just our galaxy  
 we have the observations of those planets but we just don 't know which ones are habitable yet it 's a little bit like being trapped on a red spot
 laughter on a stage
 and knowing that there are other worlds out there
 and desperately wanting to know
 more about them wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you 
 you can 't do that you can 't go there not yet  and so you have to use the tools that you 've developed
  around you for venus earth and mars and you have to apply them to these other situations  and hope that you 're making
 reasonable inferences from the data and that you 're going to be able to determine the best candidates for habitable planets and those that are not in
 the end and for now at least  this is our red spot
  this is the only planet that we know of that 's habitable  although very soon we may come to know of more 
 but for now  this is the only habitable planet  and this is our red spot
  i 'm really glad we 're here
