  some years ago i
 stumbled across a simple design exercise that helps people understand and solve complex problems and like many of these design exercises it kind of seems trivial at first 
  but under deep inspection it turns out that it reveals unexpected truths about the
  way that we collaborate and make sense of things the exercise has three parts and begins with something that we all know how to do which is how to make toast 
 it begins with a clean sheet of paper a felt marker and without using any words you begin to draw how to make toast and most people draw something like this they draw 
  a loaf of bread which is sliced then put into a toaster the toast is then deposited for some time
  it pops up  and then voila after two minutes toast and happiness 
 now over the years i 've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts  and some of them are very good because they really illustrate the toast making process quite clearly  and then there are some that are well  not so good  they
  really suck actually because you don 't know what they 're trying to say 
 under close inspection some reveal some aspects of toast making while hiding others so there 's some that are all about the toast and all about the transformation of toast and there 's others that are all about the toaster
  and the engineers love to draw the the mechanics of this 
 and then there are others that are about people  
  about visualizing the experience that people have and then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast that goes all the way back to the store it goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation
 and all the way back to the field and and wheat and one all actually goes all the way back to the big bang so it 's crazy stuff but i think
 it 's obvious that that even though these drawings are really wildly different they share a common quality and i 'm wondering if you can see it do you see it
 what 's common about these
 most drawings have nodes and links so nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people and links represent the connections between the nodes 
 and it 's the combination of links and nodes that produces a full systems model and it makes our private mental models visible about how we think something works
  so that 's the value of these things what 's interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view  so for example  
 americans make toast with a toaster that seems obvious  whereas many europeans make toast with a frying pan of course  and many students make toast with a fire
  counting the number of nodes and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes
  less than that the drawing seems trivial but it 's quick to understand and more than thirteen the drawing
 produces a feeling of map shock it 's too complex so the sweet spot is between five and thirteen so if you want to communicate something visually have between five and thirteen nodes in
  your diagram  so though we may not be skilled at drawing the point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things into simple things and then bring them back together again so this brings us to our second
 part of the exercise which is how to make toast  but now with sticky notes or with cards  so what happens then
  with cards most people tend to draw clear more detailed  and more logical nodes you can see the step by step analysis that takes place and as they build up 
  their model they move their nodes around  rearranging them like lego blocks now  though this might seem trivial it 's actually really important 
  process and systems theorists do tell us that the ease with which we can change a representation correlates
 to our willingness to improve the model  
 so sticky note systems are are not only more fluid they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings the drawings are much richer and
 brings us to our third part of the exercise which is to draw how to make toast but this time in a group so what happens then well
 here 's what happens 
 it starts out messy  and then it gets really messy  and then it gets messier but as people refine the models the best nodes become more prominent and with 
  each iteration the model becomes clearer because people build on top of each other 's ideas
  what emerges is a unified systems model that integrates the diversity of everyone 's individual points of view 
 so that 's a really different outcome from what usually happens in meetings isn 't it so these drawings can contain twenty or more nodes  but participants don 't feel map shock because they participate in the building of their models themselves 
 now what 's also really interesting that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it to deal with contradictions
  for example they add branching patterns and parallel patterns oh 
 and by the way if they do it in complete silence they do it much better and much more quickly really interesting talking gets in the way 
 so here 's some key lessons that that can emerge from this  first drawing helps us understand the situations as systems with nodes and their relationships movable cards produce better systems
  models because we iterate much more fluidly  and then the group notes produce the most comprehensive models because we synthesize several points of view  
 so that 's interesting  when people work together under the right circumstances group models are much better than individual models
 so this approach works really great for
 drawing how to make toast but what if you wanted to draw something more relevant
  or pressing like
 your organizational vision or customer experience or long term sustainability 
 there 's a visual revolution that 's taking place as more organizations are addressing their wicked problems by collaboratively drawing them out and i 'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links
 really have an edge
  and the practice is really pretty simple you start with a question  you collect the nodes you refine the nodes you do it over again you refine and refine and refine and the patterns emerge
  and the group gets clarity and you answer the question  
 so this simple act of visualizing and doing over
  and over again
 produces some really remarkable outcomes what 's really important to know is that it 's the conversations that are the important aspects not just the models themselves  
 and these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes so one example is from an organization
  big publishing company they lost a bunch of money one year and their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice and what 's interesting is that after visualizing the entire
 business systems upon systems they reclaimed fifty million dollars of revenue  and they also moved from a d rating to an a rating from their customers 
  because there 's alignment from the executive team 
 so i 'm now on a mission to help organizations solve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization and on a site that i 've produced called 
 i 've collected a bunch of best practices 
 and so you can learn how to run a workshop here you can learn more about the visual language and the structure of links and nodes
 that you can apply to general
  various templates for unpacking the thorny problems that we all
 face in our organizations 
 so the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast helps us get clear  engaged and aligned so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge remember what design has to teach us make your ideas
  it 's simple it 's fun  it 's powerful and i believe it 's an idea worth celebrating  thank you
