  what is going to be
 the future of learning 
 i do have a plan but in order for me to tell you what that plan is 
 i need to tell you a little story which kind of sets the stage
  tried to look at where did
 the kind of learning we do in schools where did it come from 
 and you can look far back into the past but if you look at present day schooling the way it is it 's quite easy to figure out
 where it came from it came from about
 three hundred years
  it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet [ the british empire ] imagine trying to run the show trying to run the entire planet  
 without computers  
 without telephones with data handwritten on pieces of paper  and traveling by ships  
 but the victorians actually did it what
 did was amazing they created a global computer
 made up of people  
 it 's still with us today  it 's called the bureaucratic administrative machine 
 in order to have that machine running you need lots and lots of people 
 they made another machine
 to produce those people the school
 the schools would produce the people
 who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine  they must be
 identical to each other they must know three things  they must have good handwriting  because the data is handwritten
  they must be able to read  and they must be able to do multiplication division addition and subtraction in their head  
 they must be so identical that you could pick one up from new zealand
 and ship them to canada
 and he would be
 instantly functional the victorians were great engineers  they engineered a system that was so robust
  's still with us today  continuously producing identical people
 for a machine that no longer exists  the empire is gone  so what are we doing
 with that design that produces these identical people and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything
  that 's a pretty strong comment there i said schools as we know them now  
 they 're obsolete i 'm not saying they 're broken  it 's quite fashionable to say that the education system 's broken it 's not broken  it 's wonderfully constructed  
 it 's just that we don 't need it anymore  
 it 's outdated  what are the kind of jobs that we have today well the clerks are the computers they 're there in thousands in every office
 and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs 
 those people don 't need to be able to write beautifully by hand  they don 't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads they do need to be able to read 
 in fact they need to be able to read discerningly well
  but we don 't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like we know that people will work from wherever they want  whenever they want in whatever way they want 
 how is  present day schooling going to prepare them
 for that world well
 i bumped into this whole thing completely by accident 
 i used to teach people how to write computer programs in new delhi  fourteen years ago  and right next to where i used to work there was
  slum and i used to think how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs or should they not 
 at the same time we also had lots of parents rich people who had computers  
 and who used to tell me you know my son  i think he 's gifted 
  so i suddenly figured that how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children 
 what did the poor do wrong  
 i made a hole in the in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen
 if i gave a computer to children who never would have one didn 't know any english
  internet was the children came running in it was three feet off the ground
  simple solution 
 one of your students must have been passing by showed them how to use the mouse 
 so i said yeah that 's possible so i repeated the experiment i went three hundred miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of
  a passing software development engineer
 was very little 
 i repeated the experiment there  there was no place to stay so i stuck my computer in i went away came back after a couple of months found kids playing games on it  when they saw me they said 
 we want a faster processor and a better mouse 
 laughter so i said how on earth do you know all this and they said something very interesting to me in
  irritated voice they said you 've given us a machine that works only in english so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it 
 that 's the first time as a teacher that i had heard the word teach ourselves said so casually
  here 's a short glimpse from those years that
 's the first day at the hole in the wall on your right is an
 to his left is his student  she 's six and
 he 's teaching her how to browse  then onto
 other parts of the country i repeated this over and over again  getting exactly the same results that we were
 and finally a girl
 explaining in marathi
 what it is and said there 's a processor inside 
 so i started publishing  i published everywhere i
 down and measured everything and i said in nine months a group of children left alone with a computer in any language
 will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the west  i 'd seen it happen over and over and over again  
 but i was curious to know what else would they do if they could do this much i started experimenting with other subjects  among them for example
  's one community of children in southern india whose english pronunciation is really bad  and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs i gave them a 
 engine in a computer  and i said keep talking into it until it types what you say
  reason i ended with the face of this young lady over there is because i suspect many of you know her she has now
 joined a call center in hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills
 in a very clear english accent
  so then
 people said well  how far will it go where does it stop i decided i would i would destroy my own argument
 by creating an absurd proposition  
 i made a hypothesis a ridiculous hypothesis tamil is a south indian language and i said can tamil speaking children in a south indian village
 learn the biotechnology of dna replication in english from a streetside computer
  i 'll spend a couple of months i 'll leave it for a couple of months i 'll go back they 'll get another zero  i 'll go back to the lab and say  we need teachers 
 i found a village it was called kallikuppam in southern india
 i put in hole in the wall computers there  
 downloaded all kinds of stuff from the internet about dna replication  most of which i didn 't understand 
 the children came rushing
  's all this so i said 
 it 's very topical very important but it 's all in english so they said how can we understand such big english words and diagrams and chemistry 
 so by now i had developed a new pedagogical method so i applied that i said
  i left them for a couple of months  they 'd got a zero  i gave them a test  i came back after two months and the children trooped in and said we 've understood nothing so i said 
 well what did i expect so i said okay but
 how long did it take you before you
  we haven 't given up we look at it every single day so i said what you don 't understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months what for so a little girl who you see just now  
 she raised her hand and she says to me in broken tamil and english she said 
 well  apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes disease we haven 't understood anything else
  i tested them  
 i got an educational impossibility zero to thirty percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn 't know doing something that 's a decade ahead of their time  
 absurd 
 but
 i had to follow the victorian norm  thirty percent is a fail
  how do i get them to pass i have to get them twenty more marks  i couldn 't find a teacher  what i did find was a friend that they had
 a 22 year old girl who was an accountant
 and she played with them all the time  so i asked this girl can you help them so she says absolutely not
 i didn 't have science in school i have no idea what they 're doing under that tree all day long 
 i can 't help you
 i said i
 'll tell you what use the method of the grandmother 
 so she says what 's that i said stand behind them  whenever they do anything you just say ' well  wow i mean how did you do that what 's the next page  gosh when i was your age i could have never done that ' you know what grannies do 
 so
 she did that for two more months the scores jumped to fifty percent kallikuppam had caught up with my
  control school in new delhi a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher when i saw that graph i knew
 there is a way to level the playing field  
 here 's kallikuppam 
  i got the camera angle wrong that one is just amateur stuff but what she was saying 
 as you could make out was about neurons with her hands were like that and she was saying neurons communicate 
 at twelve  
 so what are jobs going to be like well we know what they 're like today  
 what 's learning going to be like we know what it 's like today  children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to to pick up their books with their
  hand  what will it be tomorrow could it be
 that we don 't need to go to school at all 
 could it be that at the point in time when you need to know something you can find out in two minutes could it be
 a devastating question
  question that was framed for me by nicholas negroponte could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete 
 but that 's terrible we are homo sapiens  knowing that 's what distinguishes us from the apes  but look at it this way 
 it took nature one hundred million years
 to make the ape stand up
 and become homo sapiens  it took us only ten thousand to make knowing obsolete  what an achievement that is
 but we have to integrate that
 into our own future 
 encouragement seems to be the key  if you look at kuppam if you look at all of the experiments that i did it was simply
 saying wow saluting learning 
 there is evidence from neuroscience  the reptilian part of our brain which sits in the center of our brain
  when it 's threatened  it shuts down everything else it shuts down the prefrontal cortex  the parts which learn  it shuts all of that down 
 punishment and examinations are seen as threats  
 we take our children  we make them shut their brains down and then we say perform 
  why did they create a system like that  because it was needed there was an age in the age of empires when you needed those people
 who can survive under threat when you 're standing in a trench all alone  if you could have survived you 're okay  you 've passed  
 if you didn 't you failed  
 but the age of empires is gone  what happens to creativity in our age we need to shift that balance back
  back from threat
 to pleasure  i came back to england
 looking for british grandmothers  
 i put out notices in papers saying if you are a british grandmother if you have broadband and a web camera 
 can you give me one hour of your time per week for free  
 i got two hundred in the first two weeks i know more british grandmothers than anyone in the universe
  they 're called the granny cloud  the granny cloud sits on the internet if there 's a child in in trouble we beam a gran she
 goes on over skype and she sorts things out i 've seen them do it from a village called diggles in northwestern england  deep
  a village in tamil nadu india six thousand miles away  she does it with only one
  so what 's happening here  i think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational 
 if you allow the educational process to  self organize then learning
  it 's not about making learning happen  it 's about letting it happen  the teacher sets
 the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens i think
 that 's what all this is pointing at but how will we know how will we come to know well i intend to build these
 put together  i 've tried this in many many schools it 's been tried all over the world  and teachers sort of
 stand back and say it just happens by itself and i said yeah  it happens by itself how did you know that i said
  you won 't believe the children who told me and where they 're from 
 here 's a sole in action
  he maintains law and order
  a decade ahead of her time 
 so soles  i think we need a curriculum of big questions you already heard about that you know what what that means
  there was a time when stone age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say what are those twinkling lights 
 they built the first curriculum  but we 've lost sight of those wondrous questions  we 've brought it down to the tangent of an angle  
 but that that 's not sexy enough
  if a meteorite was coming to hit the earth 
 how would you figure out if it was going to or not 
 and if he says well what how you say there 's a magic word it 's called the tangent of an angle and leave him alone he 'll figure it out 
 so here are a couple of images from soles  
 i 've tried incredible  
  this one is about what happens to the air we breathe this is done by children
 without the help
 of any teacher  the teacher only raises the question and then stands back and admires the answer  so
  what 's my wish my wish is that we design the future of learning 
 we don 't want to be spare parts for a great human computer do we so we need to design
 a future for learning  
 and i 've got to hang on i 've got to get this wording exactly right because you know it 's very important  my wish is to help design a
 future of learning by supporting children all over the world
 to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together  help me build this school it will be called the school in the cloud  
 it will be a school
 where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in the way i want to do this
 is to build a facility where i can study this  it 's a facility which is practically unmanned
  there 's only one granny
 who who manages health and safety  the rest of it 's from the cloud  the lights are turned on and off by the cloud etc etc everything 's done from the cloud  
 but i want you for another purpose  you can do self organized learning environments at home in the school  
 outside of school in clubs  it 's very easy to do there 's a great document produced by ted which tells you how to do it
  if you would please please do it across all five continents
 and send me the data then i 'll put it all together  move it into the school of clouds  and create the future of learning 
 that 's my wish and just one last thing i 'll take you to the top of the himalayas 
 at twelve thousand feet where the air is thin  i once built
  two hole in the wall computers and the children flocked there and there was this little girl who was following me around  
 and i said to her you know i want to give a computer to everybody every child  i don 't know what should i do 
 and i was trying to take a picture of her
 quietly  she suddenly raised her hand like this 
  get on with it
