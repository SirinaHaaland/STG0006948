  when i think about dreams like many of you i think about this picture 
 i was eight when i watched neil armstrong
 step off the lunar module onto the surface of the moon i had never
  seen anything like it before and i 've never seen anything like it since 
 we got to the moon for one simple reason  
 john kennedy committed us to a deadline  
 and in the absence of that deadline we would still be dreaming about it  
 leonard bernstein said two things are necessary for great achievement
 a plan and not quite enough time 
 deadlines and commitments
 are the great and fading lessons of apollo and they are
  and our world is in desperate need of political leaders willing to set bold deadlines
 for the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of apollo again 
 when i think about dreams i think about the drag queens
 of la and stonewall and millions of other people risking everything to come out when that was really dangerous
  and of this picture of the white house lit up in rainbow colors  yes 
 celebrating america 's gay and lesbian citizens ' right to marry it is a picture 
  that in my wildest dreams i could never have imagined when i was eighteen
  and feeling estranged from my country and my dreams because of it  
 i think about this picture of my family that i never dreamed
 i could ever have 
 and of our children holding this headline i never dreamed
 could ever be printed about the supreme court ruling  we need more of the courage
 of drag queens and astronauts 
 but i want to talk about the need for us to dream in
  more than one dimension because there was something
 about apollo that i didn 't know when i was eight and something about organizing that the rainbow colors over 
 of the thirty astronauts in the original mercury gemini and apollo programs 
 only seven marriages survived  
 those iconic images of the astronauts bouncing on the moon obscure the alcoholism and depression on earth
 thomas merton the trappist monk  asked during the time of apollo what can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss
 that separates us from ourselves 
 and what can we gain by the right to marry if we are not able to cross the acrimony and
  emotional distance that so often separates us from our love and not just in marriage  i have seen the most
 hurtful  destructive  
 tragic infighting in lgbt and aids and breast cancer and non profit activism all in the name of love
  thomas merton also wrote about wars
 among saints and that there is a pervasive form of contemporary violence
 to which the idealist most easily succumbs  activism
 and overwork the frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace it destroys our own
 inner capacity for peace 
 too often our dreams become these compartmentalized fixations on some future
 that destroy our ability to be present for our lives right now 
 our dreams of a better life for some future humanity or some other humanity in another country alienate us
  beautiful human beings sitting next to us at this very moment  well that 's just the
 price of progress we say you can go to the moon or you can have stability in your family life  
 and we can 't conceive of dreaming in both dimensions at the same time and we don 't set the bar much higher than stability when it comes to our emotional life
 which is why our technology for talking to one another has gone vertical our ability to listen
 and understand one another has gone nowhere 
 our access to information is through the roof our access to joy
  our present and our future are mutually exclusive 
 that to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender our profound potential for being 
 that the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled but our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love is somehow limited
 is a false and suffocating choice
 now i 'm not suggesting simply the uninspiring idea of more work life balance 
 what good is it for me to spend more time with my kids at home if my mind is always somewhere else while i 'm doing it  
 i 'm not even talking about mindfulness mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming a tool for improving productivity
 laughter right  i 'm talking about dreaming
 as boldly in the dimension of our being
 as we do about industry and technology i 'm talking about an audacious authenticity
 that allows us to cry with one another a heroic humility
  that allows us to remove our masks and be real  
 it is our inability to be with one another our fear of crying with one another that gives rise to so many of the problems we are frantically trying to solve in the first place 
 from congressional gridlock to economic inhumanity 
 i 'm talking about what jonas salk called an epoch b
  b a new epoch
 in which we become as excited about and curious about and scientific about the development of our humanity as we are about the development of our technology 
 we should not shrink from this opportunity simply because we don 't really understand it 
 there was a time when we didn 't understand space or because we 're more
  used to technology and activism that is the very definition of being stuck in a comfort zone we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement 
 in two thousand and sixteen it is the dimension of our being itself that cries out for its fair share of our
  here to dream  but maybe if we 're honest about it each of us chasing our own dream you know looking at the name tags to see who can help me with my dream  
 sometimes looking right through one another 's humanity i can 't be bothered with you right now i have an idea for saving the world right 
  once upon a time  i had this beautiful company that created these long journeys for heroic civic engagement  
 and we had this mantra human 
 kind be both and we encouraged people to experiment outrageously with kindness 
 like go help everybody set up their tents
  go help people fix their flat tires even though you know the dinner line is going to get longer and people really took us up on this so much so that if you got a flat tire on the aids ride you had trouble fixing it because there were so many people there asking you if you needed help 
 for a few days for tens of thousands of people we created these worlds that everybody
  said were the way they wish the world could always be 
 what if we experimented with creating that kind of world
 these next few days  and instead of going up to someone and asking them what do you do ask them so
  i want to stay sober or i want to build a tree house with my kid you
 know instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet go up to the person who is all alone and ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee
  i think what we fear most
 is that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential that we are born to dream
 and we might die
 without ever having the chance  
 imagine living in a world where we simply recognize that deep  existential fear in one another
 and love one another
  boldly because we know that to be human is to live with that fear 
 it 's time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously  
 and somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things we can and will and must do
 lies the domain of all the unbelievable things
 we could be it
 's time we set foot into that dimension and came out about the fact that we have dreams there too 
 if the moon could dream  
 i think that would be its dream
  honor to be with you thank you very much
