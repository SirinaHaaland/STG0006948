  i 'm born in the western congo in an area
 around here
 and then went to university in kisangani and after i finished i went to this area the ituri forest
 but what i 've been doing
 when i was about
 fourteen
 i grew in my uncle 's house and my father was
 a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and also a
  poacher what i 've been doing from fourteen to seventeen was i was assisting them collecting
 ivory tusk
 meat and whatever they were killing poaching hunting in the forest bring it in the main city to get access to the market
 but finally i got myself involved
 around seventeen to twenty years i became myself poacher
 and i wanted to do it because i believed to continue my studies
 i wanted to go to university but my father was poor my uncle even
 so i did it and for three to four years i went to university for three times i applied to
 to biomedical science to be a doctor i didn 't succeed i was having my inscriptions my admission to biology
 and i said no way i 'm not doing it my family 's poor my area don 't have better health care i want to be a doctor to serve them
 three times that means three years and i start getting old i say oh no i continue
  so i did tropical ecology and plant botany
 when i finished i went to ituri forest for my internship
 it 's where i really getting passion with what i 'm doing right up to now i 'm standing in front of you
 doing botany and wildlife conservation
 that time the ituri forest was created as
  a forest reserve
 with some animals and also plants and the training center there was built around the
 scientific congolese staff and some american scientists also
 so the okapi faunal reserve protects
 number i
  that is the largest number of elephant we have right now in protected area in congo it has also chimpanzees and it has been named
 okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe i think you guys know it quite well here we have savanna
 giraffe but through evolutions we have this forest giraffe that lives only in congo
 it has also
 some beautiful primates thirteen species highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa
 and it has the ituri forest itself about one thousand three hundred species of plants so far known
 i join the wildlife conservation society working there in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five but i started working with them as a student in
  ninety one i was appointed as
 teaching assistant at my university because i accomplished with honor
 but i didn 't like the way the instruction i got was very poor
 and i wanted to be from to a training center and a research center with the end of
 dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko that most of you know
 life became very very difficult and the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it
 when kabila started
 his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers
 started moving and retreated so they started fleeing from the east to the west and
  okapi faunal reserve is there
 so there was a road from
 goma somewhere here and coming like this so
 they might go through pass through okapi faunal reserve congo has five of world 's richest sites
 of protected area and okapi faunal reserve is one of them
 so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve
 on their way they looted everything torture wars oh my god you can 't believe
 every person was looking his way where to go we don 't know and it was for us young
 the first time really we hear the language of war of guns
 and even people who faced the rebellion of nineteen sixty
  three after our independence they didn 't believe what was happening
 they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that
 young children
 child soldiers you can 't ask him how old he is because he has guns
 but i was from the west working in the east i even that time
  not speaking swahili
 and when they came
 they looted everything you can 't speak lingala because lingala was from mobutu and everyone speaking lingala is soldier and i was from the same area to him
 all my friends said we are leaving because we are a target
 but i 'm not going to the east because there i don 't know swahili
 i stay
 if i go i will be killed i can 't go back to my area it 's more
  than one thousand kilometers i stayed after they looted everything
 we have been doing research on botany and we have a small herbarium of four thousand five hundred
 sheets of plants we cut we dry and we packed them we mounted them on a folder
 purpose so that we start them for agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science
  for
 the study of the flora and the change of the forest
 that is people moving around that 's even pygmies and this is
 a bright guy hard working person and pygmies i 've been working with him about ten years
 and with soldiers they went to the forest for poaching elephants because he 's pygmies he know how to track
  elephant in the forest he have been attacked by
 leopard and they abandon him in the forest
 they came to told me i have to save him and what i did i gave him just antibiotics that we care for that
 tuberculosis and fortunately i saved his life
 and that was the language of the war everywhere there have
  been constant extraction of mineral killing animals
 the logging timbers and so on and what of important things i think all of you here have a cell phone
 that mineral have killed a lot five five millions of congolese have gone because of this colombo tantalite they call it coltan
 that they use it to
  make cell phone and it have been in that area all over in congo extraction and good big business of the war
 and what i did for the first war
 after we have lost everything i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff
 i buried some of our new vehicle engine i buried it to save it and some
  equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he 's not collecting plants he 's going to save our equipment on the canopy and
 with the material that 's left because they wanted to destroy it to burn it they didn 't understand it they didn 't go to school
 i packed it and that is me going to
 hurrying to uganda try to save that four thousand material with people
 carrying them on the bikes bicycles and after that we succeeded i housed that four thousand material at the
 herbarium of makerere university and after the war i have been able to bring it back home so that we continue our studies
 the second war came while we didn 't expect it with friends we have been sitting and watching match
  football and having some good music with
 worldspace radio when it started i think
 so it was so bad we heard that now from the east again the war started
 and it 's going fast this time i think kabila will go in place of as he did with mobutu and the reserve was target to the rebels
  movements and two militia acting in the same area and competing for natural resources and there was no way to to work
 they destroy everything
 poaching oh no way and that 's the
 powerful men we have to meet and to talk to them what 's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks and they can 't do what
 they are doing so we went to meet them that is
 coltan extraction gold mining mining
 so we started talking with them
 convincing them that we are in a protected area there is regulations
 that it 's prohibited to do logging mining and poaching specifically
 but they said you guys you think that soldier who are dying are
  not important and your animals you are protecting are most important
 we don 't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here
 we started talking with them and i was negotiating
 tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand
  five hundred people
 and we continued but i was doing that
 negotiating with them sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with jean pierre bemba with mbusa nyamwisi with kabila
 and
 i 'm there sometimes they talk to my own language that is lingala i hear it and what strategy they are doing what they are planning sometimes they are having helicopter to supply them with ammunition
  and so on they used me to carry that
 and i was doing counting what comes from where and where and where i had only this equipment
 my satellite phone my computer and a plastic
 solar panel that i hide it in the forest and every time daily after we have meeting what
  compromise we have whatever i go i write a short email send it
 i don 't know how many people i had on my
 my address i sent the message what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do they started suspecting that what we do on the morning and
 the afternoon it 's on the news bbc rfi
 something might be going
  on and one day we went for a meeting
 sorry
 one day we went to meet the chief commander he had the same
 iridium cell phone like me and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never seen it
 i don 't know and i had mine on my pocket so it was a chance that they trusted me a lot they didn
  was not
 looking on me so i was scared and when we finished the meeting i went to return it in the forest and i was
 sending news
 doing whatever reporting daily to u n to unesco to our institution in new york what have been going and for that they have been having big pressure to leave to free the area because there was no way
  whatever they do it 's known the same times
 during the first two rebellions they killed all animals in the zoo we have a zoo of fourteen okapis and one of them was pregnant
 and during the war after a week of heavy war
 fighting in the area we succeeded we had the first okapi this is the only trouser and shirt i remind me of this this is not local population this is rebels
 they are now happy sending the news that they have protected the okapi with the war because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere
 after a week we celebrated the
 birthday of that okapi they killed elephant just fifty meters to the
 area where the zoo where okapi was born and i was mad i oppose it that they are now going to dissect it until i do my
 my report and then i see
 the chief commander and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and they just got the the tusks
 what we are doing after that that was the
 situation of the war we have to rebuild i had some money i was paid one hundred and fifty dollars i devoted
 half of it
 to rebuild the herbarium because we didn 't have good infrastructure to start plants wildlife conservation society more dealing with plants
 i started this with seventy dollars and start fundraising money to where i 've been going i had opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my african material is and
 they supported me a bit
  and i built this now it 's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing
 my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is playing to uptake carbon
  this is one of the study we are doing on forty hectares plot where we have tagged
 trees and lianas from one centimeters and we are tracking them we have now data of about fifteen years
 to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions
 and that is i think it
 's difficult for me this is a very embarrassing talk i know i don 't know where
  to start where to to finish it when i was thinking to come here what best title i wanted to say to to my talk
 i didn 't find this but now i think that i would have titled it the language of guns
 where are you people
 now we are talking about reconstitution rebuild africa but is gun industries a tool to
  rebuild or is it a game i think
 we we see the war like a game like soccer football everybody is happy but see what it 's doing see what is
 going in darfur now we say oh my god see what the wars in rwanda that 's
 because of the language of guns
 i don 't think that someone may blame google
 because it 's doing the right things
 even if people like al qaeda are using google to connect between them but it 's serving millions for the best
 but what is doing with gun industries thank you
  amazing story
 i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have how can we
 help you
 that 's really embarrassing questions i think that now i feel nervous and
  think helping us people are acting sometimes by ignorance
 i did it myself if i know when i was young that killing elephant i 'm destroying biodiversity i would not have done it
 many many of you have seen the talents of africans but there are few who are going to school
 many are dying because of all those kind
  of pandemics hiv malaria poverty not going to school
 what you can assist us it 's by building capacities how many have got opportunity like me to go to u s do a master 's and go now i 'm in the netherlands to do a ph d but many of them are just here because they don 't have money
 and they can 't go even to university they can 't even attend
 bachelor 's degree building capacities for young generation is going to make better generation and
