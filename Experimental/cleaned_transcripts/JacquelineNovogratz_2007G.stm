  i really am honored to be here and as chris said it 's been over twenty years since i started working in africa  my first introduction
 was at the abidjan airport on a sweaty  ivory coast coast morning i had just
  cut my hair to look like margaret mead given away most everything that i owned and arrived with all the essentials some poetry a few clothes and of course a guitar
 because i was going to save the world and i thought i would just start with the african continent  
 but literally within days of arriving i was told in no uncertain terms by
 a number of west african women that
 africans didn 't want saving thank you very much least of all not by me i was too young
  had no children didn 't really know africa and besides my french was pitiful and so it was an incredibly painful time in my life  and yet
 it really started to give me the humility to start listening 
 i think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well  so i moved to kenya and and worked in uganda and i
  to move to kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there and
 i did and we ended up naming it duterimbere meaning to go forward with enthusiasm and while we were doing it i realized that there weren 't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women and so maybe i should try to run a business too 
 and so i started looking around and i heard about a bakery that was run by twenty prostitutes
  being a little intrigued  i went to go meet this group and what i found was twenty unwed mothers who were trying to survive  and
 it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language and how what we call people so often distances us from them and makes them little 
 i also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business that in fact it was a classic charity run by a
  six hundred dollars a month to keep these twenty women busy making little crafts and
 baked goods and living on fifty cents a day still in poverty  so i made a deal with the women 
 i said look we get rid of the charity side and we run this as a business and i 'll help you 
 they nervously agreed  
 i nervously started and of course things are always harder than you think they 're going to be 
 first of all i thought well we need a sales team and we clearly
  so
 let 's i did all this training  and
 the epitome was when i literally marched into the streets of nyamirambo which is the popular quarter of kigali with a bucket and i sold
 all these little doughnuts to people and i came back and i was like you see and the women said you know jacqueline who in nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an
  i went the whole american way with competitions team and individual completely failed  but over time the women learnt to sell on their own way  and they started listening to the marketplace and they came back with ideas
 for cassava chips and banana chips and sorghum bread and before you knew it we had cornered the kigali market and the women were earning three to four times the national
  i 'm learning to listen you choose  it 's your bakery your street  your country not mine but
 they wouldn 't give me an answer so one week two weeks three weeks went by and finally i said well how about blue and they said blue blue we love blue let 's do it blue so i went to the
 store i
 brought gaudence the recalcitrant one
  of all and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains and on painting day we all gathered in nyamirambo and
 the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim like a little french bakery but that was clearly not as satisfying as painting
 a wall of blue like a morning sky so blue  blue everything became blue  the walls were blue the windows were blue the sidewalk out front
 was painted blue
  franklin was shouting 
  the women 's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes but it was their day  and at the end of it  we stood across the street
 and we looked at what we had done and i said it is so beautiful and the women said it really is and i said and i think the color is perfect 
 and they all nodded their head except for
  but that when you 've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long it 's really hard to say what you mean 
  mostly because people never really ask you and when they do you don 't really think they want to know the truth  
 and so then i learned that listening is not only about waiting but it 's also learning how better to ask questions  
 and so i lived in kigali for about two and a half years  doing these two things and it was an extraordinary time in my life and it taught me
 three lessons that i think are so important for us today
  and certainly in the work that i do the first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth 
 as eleni has said when people gain income they gain choice and that is fundamental to to dignity 
 but as human beings we also want to see each other and we want to be heard by each other and we should never forget that 
 the second is that traditional charity and aid
 are never going to solve the problems of poverty i think andrew pretty well covered
  so i will move to the third point  which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty  yes we ran this as a business  
 but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support
 that came into the training and the management support the strategic advice and maybe most important of all 
 the access to new contacts networks and new markets  
 and so  on a micro level there 's a real role for this combination of investment and
  philanthropy  and on a macro level some of the speakers have
 inferred that even health should be privatized but having had a father with heart disease and realizing that
 what what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten  and having a good friend step in to help i really believe
  at prices they can afford i think the market can help us figure that out but there 's got to be a charitable component or i don 't think we 're
 going to create the kind of societies we want to live in 
 and so it was really those lessons that made me decide to build acumen fund about six years ago  it 's a nonprofit venture capital fund for the poor a few oxymorons in one sentence 
 it essentially raises charitable funds from individuals foundations and corporations and then we turn around and we invest equity
  and loans in both for profit and nonprofit entities
 that deliver affordable health housing  energy  clean water to low income people in south asia and africa  so that they can make their own choices  
 we 've invested about twenty million dollars in twenty different enterprises  and have in so doing created nearly twenty thousand jobs 
 and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not
 be able to afford them
  i want to tell you two stories  both of them are in africa  both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service 
 and who really know the markets both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise  
 and both of them because they 're manufacturers create jobs directly 
 and create incomes indirectly because they 're in the malaria sector and africa loses about thirteen billion dollars a year
  malaria  and so as people get healthier  they also get wealthier  the first one
 is called advanced bio extracts limited  it 's a company built in kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named patrick henfrey and his three colleagues these are
 old hand farmers who 've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in kenya over the last thirty years now this plant
 is an artemisia plant  it 's the basic component for
  is the best known treatment for malaria  it 's indigenous to china and the far east 
 but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in africa  patrick and his colleagues said let 's bring it here  because it 's a high 
 the farmers get three to four times the the yields that they would with maize  
  using patient capital money that they could raise early on that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined
 with management assistance strategic assistance they 've now created a company where they purchase from seven thousand five hundred farmers so that 's about fifty thousand people affected  and i think some of you may have visited
 these farmers are helped by kickstart and technoserve who help them become
  they buy it they dry it and they bring it to this factory which was purchased in part by  again patient capital from novartis who has a real interest in getting the the powder
 so that they can make coartem  acumen 's been working with
 abe for the past year year and a half  both on
 looking at a new business plan and what does expansion look like helping with management support and helping to do term sheets and raise raise capital  
 and i really understood what patient capital meant
 emotionally in the last month or so because the company was literally
 ten days away from proving that the product they produced
 was at the world quality level needed to make coartem when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history  and
 we called all of the social investors we know now some of these same social investors are really interested in africa and and understand the importance of
  agriculture  and they even helped the farmers and even when we explained that if abe goes away all those seven thousand five hundred jobs go away too  
 we sometimes have this bifurcation between
 business and and the social and it 's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused  so acumen made not one but two
 bridge loans and the good news is they did indeed meet
  world quality classification
 and are now in the final stages of closing a 20 million dollar round to move it to the next level and i think that this will be one of the more important companies
 in east africa  this is samuel he 's a farmer  he was actually living in the kibera slums when his father called him and told him about artemisia
  so he moved back to the farm and long story short they now have seven acres under cultivation  samuel 's kids are in
 private school  and he 's starting to help other farmers in the area also
 go into artemisia production dignity being more important
 than wealth  the next one many of you know i talked about it a little at oxford two years ago
  and some of you visited a to z manufacturing which is one of the great real companies in east africa it 's another one that lives at the confluence of
 health and enterprise  and this is really a story about a public private solution that has
 has really worked it started in japan sumitomo had developed a
 technology essentially to impregnate a 
 fiber with organic insecticide so you could create a bed net a malaria bed net that would last five years and not need to be
  could alter the vector  but like artemisia it had been produced only in east asia 
 and as part of its social responsibility  sumitomo said why don 't we experiment with whether we can produce it in africa for africans 
 unicef came forward and said we 'll buy most of the nets and then we 'll give them away as part of the global fund 's
 and the u n ' s commitment to
 pregnant women and children for free
  came in with the patient capital and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in africa and exxon
 provided the initial resin 
 well in looking around for entrepreneurs there was none better that we could find on earth than anuj shah in a to z manufacturing company it 's a 40 year old company it understands manufacturing
  it 's gone from socialist tanzania into capitalist tanzania and continued to flourish it had about one thousand
 employees when we first found it  and so anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid
 establishment to
 work with malaria and long story short again  they 've been so successful in our first year the first net went went off the line in
  number was one hundred and fifty thousand nets a year this year they are now producing eight million nets a year and they employ five thousand people ninety percent of whom
 are women mostly unskilled 
 they 're in a joint venture with sumitomo  
 and so from an enterprise perspective for africa and from a public health perspective 
 these are real successes  but it 's only half the story if we 're really looking at solving problems of poverty
 's a company with one big customer and
 if avian flu hits or for any other reason
 the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority  everybody loses  and so  anuj and and acumen have been talking about
 testing the private sector because the assumption that the
  a country like tanzania eighty percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day  it costs at manufacturing point  six dollars to produce these and it costs the the
 establishment another six dollars to distribute it so
 the market price in a free market would be about twelve dollars per net most people can 't afford that so let 's give it away free and we said well  there 's another option 
 let 's use the market as the best listening device we have 
 and understand at what price people would pay
  for this so they get the dignity of choice we can start building local distribution and actually it can cost the public sector much less 
 and so we came in with a second round of patient capital to a to z 
 a loan as well as a grant so that a to z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace  and found a number of things one that people will pay different prices 
 but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net
  net and make a decision to buy it and when you listen to them they 'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don 't like and that
 some of the channels we thought would work didn 't work but because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital  
 we 've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute and a dollar to buy the net  so then from a policy perspective when you start with the market
 we have a choice  we can continue going along at twelve dollars a net 
 and the customer pays zero  
 or we could at least experiment with some of it to charge one dollar a net costing the public sector another six dollars a net 
 give the people the dignity of choice  and have a distribution system that might over time start sustaining itself  we 've got to start having conversations
  like this and i don 't think there 's any better way to start than using the market but also to bring other people to the table around it  whenever i
 go to visit a to z i
 think of my grandmother stella she
 was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines she grew up on a farm in austria very poor  didn 't have very much education she moved to the
  united states where she met my grandfather who was a cement hauler  and
 they
 had nine children three of them died as babies my grandmother had tuberculosis  and she worked in a sewing machine shop making shirts for about ten cents an hour 
 she like so many of the women i see at a to z worked
  understood what suffering was had a deep faith in god loved her children and would never have accepted a handout  
 but because she had the opportunity of the marketplace  and
 she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education her children and their children
 were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams
  committed to service
