  you know that all of the cool people are they 're doing it  and you 're on the outside you 're at home you 're like the raspyni brothers where you 've got your
  got your balls in cold water  and 
 you just play with your fingers all day and then you get invited and you 're on the inside  and
 it 's everything you hoped it would be it 's exciting and there 's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it 's over 
 and it 's only taken five minutes  and you want to go back and do it again
  but i really appreciate being here and  thank you chris and also thank you deborah patton for making this possible  so
 anyway today we 'll talk about architecture a little bit  within the subject of creation
 and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you 've got two choices that you can talk about you can talk about creationism
 which i think wouldn 't go down
  well with this audience at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it or you can talk about optimisations spelled the british way with an s  
 instead of a z and i think that 's what i 'd like to talk about today but
 any kind of conversation about architecture which is in fact what you were just talking about what was going on here setting up
  at the present time can 't really happen
 without a conversation about this 
 the world trade center  and what 's been going on there what it means to us  because
 if architecture is what i believe it to be which is the built form of our cultural ambitions  
 what do you do when presented with an opportunity to
  rectify a situation that represents somebody else 's cultural ambitions relative to us  and our own opportunity 
  to make something new there this has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time i think that the world trade center in  rather an
  brought architecture into focus in a way that i don 't think people had thought of in a long time 
 and made it a subject for common conversation i don 't remember in my 20 year career of practicing and writing about architecture a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning 
 fire exiting safety concerns and whether carpet burns  these are just not things we talked about very often
 and yet now  it 's talked about all the time at the point where you
  can weaponize your buildings  
 you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way  and so now we 're going to think about architecture in a very different way 
 we 're going to think about it like this how many of you saw usa today  today
  there it is looks like that there 's the world trade
 center site on the front cover they 've made a selection they 've chosen a project by daniel libeskind the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture
  piano player he started on the squeezebox and moved to a little more serious issue a bigger instrument and now to an even larger instrument  upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic as you see here
  he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition after six previous
 firms
 struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go oh i 'm really sorry we screwed up 
 right can we do this again from the top except use some people with a vague hint of talent  instead of just six
 utter boobs like we brought in last time real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities let 's bring in
  real architects for a change  and so we got this or we had a choice of
 that oh stop clapping 
 it 's too late that is gone this was a scheme by a team called think a new york based team  and then there was that one which was the libeskind scheme this one  
 this is going to be the new world trade center  a giant hole in the ground with big
  buildings falling into it now i don 't know what you think but i think this is a pretty stupid decision 
 because what you 've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever  
 but that 's what we 're going to do but i want you to think about these things
 in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents and that these two things talk
  about very specifically  and that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic 
 solution to everything that there is a large technical answer that can solve all problems be they social be they physical be they
  or something that 's more of a romantic solution now i don 't mean romantic as in this is a nice place to take someone on a date  
 i mean romantic in the sense of there are things larger and grander than us so in the american tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between
 thomas jefferson 's cartesian grids spreading across the united states that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the united states as a
  really truly technocratic solution  a bowing to the in jefferson 's time current popular philosophy of
 rationalism  or
 the way we went to describe that later manifest destiny  now which would you rather be a grid
  it sounds big it sounds important it sounds solid it sounds american ballsy serious  male  
 and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time i mean it goes on in our private lives too every single day we all want to go out and buy an
  an audi tt don 't we everyone here must own one or at least they craved one the moment they saw one  and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key  rather than the real 
  key  zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle 
 why  why  why do you want to do that why do we all want to do that i even
  in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between
 this technocratic solution and a larger sort of more romantic image of where we are so we 're going to go straight into this can i have the lights off for a moment 
 i 'm going to talk about two architects very very briefly that represent the the current split architecturally
  between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution
 and a romantic solution and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today one very young one a little more mature 
 this is the work of a firm called shop and what you 're seeing here
 their isometric drawings of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park does everybody know what a camera obscura is  yeah  it 's one of those
 giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world it 's sort of a little movie
 without any moving parts and projects it on a page and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it  this is just the outline of it and you can see does it look like a regular building no it 
  's actually non orthogonal it 's not up and down square rectangular anything like that that you 'd see in a normal shape of a building the computer revolution the technocratic technological revolution has allowed us to
  traditionally shaped buildings in favor of non orthogonal buildings such as this  what 's interesting about it is not the shape what 's interesting about it is how it 's made 
 how it 's made a brand new way to put buildings together something called mass customization no it is not an oxymoron what makes the building expensive in the traditional sense is making 
 individual parts custom that you can 't do over and over again that 's why we all live in developer houses  they all want to save money by building the same thing five hundred times 
 mass customization works by an architect
 feeding into a computer a program that says  manufacture these parts the computer then talks to a machine
  a computer operated machine a cad cam machine that can make a zillion different changes at a moment 's notice because the computer is just a machine it doesn 't care
  it 's manufacturing the parts  it doesn 't see any excess cost it doesn 't spend any extra time  it 's not a laborer it 's simply an electronic lathe so the parts can all be cut at the same time meanwhile  
 instead of sending someone working drawings which are those huge sets of blueprints that you 've seen your whole life what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions like you used to get when you were a child when you bought little models that
  and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site to that builder and a set of these instruction 
  manuals just simple bolt a to b and they will be able to put them together here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works
 these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 which is a museum in brooklyn new york as part of their young architects summer series and they said well it 's summer what do you do in the summer you go to the beach 
 and when you go to the beach  what do you get you get sand dunes so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana 
  out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune they took photographs they fed the photographs into their computer program and that computer program shaped a sand dune and 
  then took that sand dune shape and turned it into at their instructions using standard software with slight modifications
  piece of wood to be cut all of which were delivered by flat bed on a truck and hand assembled in forty eight hours by a team of eight people only one of whom had ever seen the plans before 
 only one of whom had ever seen the plans before  and here comes dune scape coming up out of the courtyard 
 and there it is fully built there are only sixteen different pieces of wood
  only sixteen different assembly parts here  
 looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside  it has its own built in swimming pool 
 very very cool 
 it 's a great place for parties it was it was only up for six weeks  
 it 's got little dressing rooms and cabanas where lots of interesting things went on all summer long 
 now  lest you think
  that this is only for
 the light at heart or just temporary installations this is the same firm working at the world trade center  replacing the bridge that used to go across west street that very important pedestrian connection between
 the city of new york
 and the redevelopment of the west side they were asked to design
  replace that bridge in six weeks building it including all of the parts manufactured  
 and they were able to do it that was their design  using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts a couple of struts like this some exterior cladding 
  material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off site and delivered by truck  they were able to create that 
  on the side of new york  using the same technology here we 're going to walk across the bridge at night it 's self lit you don 't need any overhead lighting so the neighbors don 't complain about metal halide lighting in their face here it is going across 
 and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur now let me show you quickly the opposite if i may 
 woo pretty huh this is the other side of the coin  this is the work of david rockwell
 from new york city whose work you can see out here today
 the current king of the romantics  who approaches his work in a very different fashion  it 's not to create a technological solution  it 's to seduce you into something that you can do 
 into something that will please you something that will lift your spirits something that will make you feel as if are in another world such as his nobu restaurant in new york which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city
  simplicity of japan and the elegance of japanese tradition when it 's all said and done  it 's got to look like seaweed said the owner  
 or his restaurant pod in philadelphia pennsylvania i want you to know the room you 're looking at is stark white  every single surface of this restaurant is white 
 the reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting  it 's all
  about sensuality  it 's all about transforming watch this i 'm not touching any buttons ladies and gentlemen  this is happening by itself 
 it transforms through the magic of lighting  it 's all about sensuality it 's all about touch rosa mexicano restaurant where he transports us to the shores of acapulco 
 up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff divers
  like that let 's see it one more time  okay just to make sure that you 've enjoyed it  
 and finally it 's about comfort  it 's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn 't have felt good before it 's about bringing nature to the inside
