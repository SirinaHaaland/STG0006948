  for the past few years i 've been spending my summers
 in the marine biological laboratory in woods hole massachusetts  and there what i 've been doing is
 essentially renting a boat what i would like to do is ask you to come on a boat ride with me tonight
 so we ride off from eel pond
 into vineyard sound right off the coast of martha 's vineyard  equipped with a drone to identify potential spots from which to peer into the atlantic
 earlier i was going to say into the depths of the atlantic
  but we don 't have to go too deep to reach the unknown  here barely two miles away from
  what is arguably the greatest marine biology lab in the world  
 we lower a simple plankton net into the water and bring up to the surface things that humanity rarely pays any attention to 
 and oftentimes has never seen before 
 here 's one of the organisms that we caught in our net this is a
  but look closely  and living inside of this animal is another organism that is very likely entirely new to science a complete new species 
 or how about this other transparent beauty
 with a beating heart asexually growing on top of its head  progeny that will move on to reproduce sexually
 let me say that again this animal is growing
  top of its head  progeny that is going to reproduce sexually in the next generation 
 a weird jellyfish not quite this is an ascidian 
 this is a group of animals that now we know we share extensive genomic ancestry with 
 and it is perhaps the closest invertebrate species to our own  
 meet your cousin thalia democratica laughter
 i 'm pretty sure you didn 't save a spot at your
  family reunion for thalia  
 but let me tell you these animals are profoundly related to us in ways that we 're just beginning to understand 
 so next time you hear anybody derisively telling you that this type of research is a simple fishing expedition  
 i hope that you 'll remember the trip that we just took 
 today many
  sciences only see value in studying deeper what we already know
 in mapping already discovered continents  but some of us are much more interested in the unknown  
 we want to discover completely new continents  and gaze at magnificent vistas of ignorance  
 we crave the experience of being completely baffled by something we 've never seen
  before  and yes i agree there 's a lot of little ego satisfaction in being able to say hey  i was the first one to discover that 
 but this is not  a self aggrandizing enterprise  
 because in this type of discovery research if you don 't feel like a complete idiot most of the time you 're just not sciencing hard enough
  summer
 i bring onto the deck of this little boat of ours more and more things that we know very little about
 i would like tonight to tell you a story about life that rarely gets told
 in an environment like this from the vantage point of our
  biological laboratories we have begun to illuminate many mysteries of life with knowledge  
 we sense that after centuries of scientific research we 're beginning to make significant inroads into understanding some of the most fundamental principles of life
 our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology across the globe  
 striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases
 things like cancer  aging  degenerative diseases  these are but some of the
 undesirables we wish to tame 
 i often wonder  why is it that we are having so much trouble trying to solve the problem of cancer is it that we 're trying to solve the
  and not trying to understand life 
 life on this planet shares a common origin  
 and i can summarize three point five billion years of the history of life on this planet in a single slide what you see here are representatives of all known species in our planet
 in this immensity of life and biodiversity  we occupy a rather unremarkable position
  homo sapiens 
 the last of our kind  
 and though i don 't really want to disparage at all the accomplishments of our species  as much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is 
 we are not the measure of all things  
 we are however the measurers of many things  we relentlessly
  analyze and compare  and some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary  
 but this emphasis today on forcing biological research to specialize
 and to produce practical outcomes is actually restricting our ability to interrogate life to unacceptably narrow confines and unsatisfying depths 
 we are measuring
 an astonishingly narrow sliver of life and hoping that those
  numbers will save all of our lives how narrow do you ask well let me give you a number 
 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently estimated that about ninety five percent of our oceans remain unexplored 
 now let that sink in for a second
  very safe to say that we don 't even know how much about life we do not know 
 so it 's not surprising that every week in my field we begin to see the addition of more and more new species to this amazing tree of life 
 this one for example discovered earlier this summer 
 new to science and now occupying its lonely branch in our family tree 
 what is even more tragic is that we know about
  a bunch of other species of animals out there  but their biology remains sorely under studied 
 i 'm sure some of you have heard about the fact that a starfish can actually regenerate its arm after it 's lost  but some of you might not know that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish  
 and there are animals out there that do truly astounding things
  willing to bet that many of you have never heard of the flatworm
  little guy right here
 does things that essentially just blow my mind 
 you can grab one of these animals and cut it into eighteen different fragments and each and every one of those fragments will go on to regenerate a
  for the past decade and a half or so i 've been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do and how they pull this magic trick off but like all good magicians 
 they 're not really releasing their secrets readily to me 
 so here we are after twenty years of essentially
 studying these animals genome mapping  chin scratching
  and thousands of amputations and thousands of regenerations 
 we still don 't fully understand how these animals do what they do each planarian an ocean unto itself
 full of unknowns
 one of the common characteristics of all of these animals i 've been talking to you about is that they did not appear to have received the memo
 that they need to behave according to the rules that we have
  derived from a handful of randomly selected animals that currently populate the vast majority of biomedical laboratories across the world  
 meet our nobel prize winners seven species essentially 
 that have produced for us the brunt of our understanding of biological behavior today  
 this little guy right here
 three nobel prizes in twelve years
  and yet  after all the attention they have garnered and all the knowledge they have generated as well as the lion 's share of the funding 
 here we are standing [ before ] the same litany of intractable problems and many new challenges  
 and that 's because unfortunately these seven animals essentially correspond
 to zero point zero zero zero nine percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet
 so i 'm beginning to suspect that our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best  
 and at worst is leading us astray 
 that 's because life on this planet and its history is the history of rule breakers 
 life started on the face of this planet as single cell organisms swimming for millions of years in the ocean until one of those creatures decided i 'm going to do
  things differently today today i would like to invent something called multicellularity  and i 'm going to do this and i 'm sure it wasn 't a popular decision at the time but somehow 
 it managed to do it and then  multicellular organisms began to populate all these ancestral oceans  and they thrived  and we have them here today  
 land masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans  and another creature thought
  of real estate  i 'd like to move there are you crazy you 're going to desiccate out there nothing can live out of water but life found a way  
 and there are organisms now that live on land  once on land they may have looked up into the sky and 
  the clouds  i 'm going to fly you can 't break the law of gravity there 's no way you can fly 
 and yet nature has invented multiple and independent times ways to fly
 i love to study these animals that break the rules because every time they break a rule they invent something new that made it possible for us to be able to be here today  these animals did not get the memo they break the rules  
 so if we 're going to study animals that break the rules  shouldn 't how we study them also break the
  i think we need to renew our spirit of exploration  rather than bring nature into our laboratories and interrogate it there  we need to bring our science into the majestic laboratory that is nature  
 and there with our modern technological armamentarium  interrogate every new form of life we find  and any new biological attribute that we may find  
 we actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again
 clueless
 the immensity of the unknown  
 because after all science is not really about knowledge science is about ignorance that 's what we do  once
  wrote if you want to build a ship don 't drum up people to collect wood and don 't assign them tasks and work  but rather teach them to long for the endless
  immensity of the sea as
 a scientist and a teacher  i like to paraphrase this to read that we scientists need to teach our students to long for the endless immensity of the sea that is our ignorance  
 we homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry
  like all other species on this planet are inextricably woven into the history of life on this planet 
 and i think i 'm a little wrong when i say that life is a mystery  
 because i think that life is actually an open secret that has been beckoning our species for millennia to understand it 
 so i ask you aren
 't we the best chance that life has to know itself  and if so  what the heck are we waiting for thank you
