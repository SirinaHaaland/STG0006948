  let 's start with day and night
 life evolved under conditions of light and darkness light and then darkness and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in
  light these are chemical clocks and they 're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell i
 'll give you an example if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach and you fly it all the way across the continent and you drop it into a sloped cage
 it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores and it 'll skitter down again right as the
  water is receding thousands of miles away it 'll do this for weeks until it kind of gradually loses the plot
 and it 's incredible to watch but there 's nothing psychic or paranormal going on it 's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond usually with what 's going on around it
 so we have this ability as well and in humans we call it the body clock
 you can see this most clearly when you take away someone 's watch and you shut them into a bunker deep underground for a couple of months
 people actually volunteer for this and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole
 so no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be they all show the same thing they get up just a
  little bit later every day say fifteen minutes or so and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks
 and so in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks rather than somehow sensing the day outside
 so fine we have a body clock and it turns out that it 's incredibly important in our lives it 's a huge driver for culture
 and i think that it 's the most underrated force on our behavior
 we evolved as a species near the
  equator and so we 're very well equipped to deal with twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of darkness
 but of course we 've spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada where i live we have perpetual daylight in summer and twenty four hours of darkness in winter so the culture 
  the northern aboriginal culture traditionally has been highly seasonal in winter
  and in summer it 's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours very active
 so what would our natural rhythm look like what would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense
 well it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all they sleep twice every night they go to bed around
 eight zero pm
 until midnight and then again they sleep from about two zero am until sunrise
 and in between they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed
 and during this time there 's a surge of prolactin the likes of which a modern day never sees the people in these studies
 report feeling so awake during the daytime that they realize
 they 're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives
 so cut to the modern day we 're living in a culture of jet lag global travel twenty four hour business shift work
 and you know our modern ways of of doing things
  have their advantages but i believe we should understand the costs thank you
  are working on their
