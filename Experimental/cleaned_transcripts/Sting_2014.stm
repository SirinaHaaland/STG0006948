  was born and raised in
 the shadow of a shipyard in a little town on the northeast coast of england some of my earliest memories
 are of giant ships blocking the end of my street as well as the sun for
  lot of the year  every morning as a child  i 'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill
 to work in the shipyard i 'd watch those same men walking back home every night  it has to be said the shipyard was not the most
 pleasant place to live next door to or indeed work in the shipyard was noisy  
 dangerous  highly toxic with an appalling health and safety record
 despite that the men and women who worked on those ships
 were extraordinarily proud of the work they did and justifiably so some of the largest vessels
 ever constructed on planet earth were built right at the end of
 my street  my grandfather had been a a shipwright  and as a child as there were few other jobs in the town i would wonder with some
 anxiety whether that would be my destiny too i was fairly determined that it wouldn 't be 
 i had other dreams not necessarily
 practical ones but
 at the age of eight  i was bequeathed a guitar  it was a battered old thing with five rusty strings
  and was out of tune but quickly i learned to play it and realized that i 'd found
 a friend for life an accomplice
 in my plan to escape from this surreal
 industrial landscape  well they say if you dream something hard enough it will come to pass  either that or i was extremely lucky but this was my
  i dreamt i would leave this town and just like those ships once they were launched i 'd never come back 
 i dreamt i 'd become a writer of songs 
 that i would sing those songs to vast numbers of people all over the world that i would be paid extravagant amounts of money 
 that i 'd become famous that i 'd marry a beautiful woman have
  buy a big house in the country  keep dogs  grow wine have rooms full of grammy awards platinum discs and what have you 
 so far so good right 
 and then one day the songs stopped coming  
 and while you 've suffered from periods of writer 's block before albeit briefly this is something chronic day after day you
  face a blank page and
 nothing 's coming and those days turned to weeks and weeks to months and pretty soon
 those months have turned into years with very little to show
 for your efforts no songs
  so you start asking yourself questions what have i done to offend the gods that they would abandon me so 
 is the gift of songwriting
 taken away as easily as it seems to
  have been bestowed or perhaps there 's a
 more a deeper psychological reason it was always a faustian pact anyway 
 you 're rewarded for revealing your innermost thoughts your private emotions on the page for the entertainment of others for the
 analysis the
  and perhaps you 've given enough of your privacy away 
 and yet if you look at your work could it be argued that your best work wasn 't about you at all it was about
 somebody else did your best work occur when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story but told someone else 's
  stood in his shoes for a while or saw the world through his eyes well they say write what you know 
 if you can 't write about yourself anymore then who do you write about 
 so it 's ironic that the the landscape i 'd worked so hard to escape from and the community that i 'd more or less abandoned and
 exiled myself from should be the very landscape the very
  community i would have to return to
 to find my missing muse  and as soon as i did that as
 soon as i decided to honor the community i came from and tell
 their story that the songs started to come thick and fast  i 've described it as a kind of
 projectile
  entire songs almost
 formed whole materialized in front of me
 as if they 'd been bottled up inside me for many many years one of the first things i wrote was just a list of names of people i 'd known and they become
  where they explain who they are what they do their hopes and their fears
 for the future this is jackie white he 's the foreman of the shipyard 
 my name is jackie white  and i 'm foreman of the yard  and you don 't mess with jackie on this quayside  
 i 'm as hard as iron plate woe betide you if you 're late
 when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide now you can die and
  heaven  but you need to work your shift  and i 'd expect you all to back us to the hilt for if st peter at his gate
 were to ask you why you 're late why you tell him that you had to get a ship built 
 we build battleships and cruisers for her majesty the queen supertankers for onassis and all the classes in between we built the
  greatest ship in tonnage what the world has ever seen
  having decided to write about other people instead of myself a
 further irony is that sometimes you reveal more about yourself than you 'd ever intended this song is called dead man 's boots which is an expression
 which describes how difficult it is to get a job in other words you 'd only get a job in the shipyard if somebody else died  or perhaps your father could finagle
 an apprenticeship at the age of fifteen  but sometimes a father 's love can be misconstrued as
 controlling  and conversely the scope of his son 's ambition can seem
  these dead man 's boots know their
  these dead man 's boots know their
  these dead man 's boots know their way down the
  these dead man 's boots know their way down the hill
  when your whole life is through
  they would invite some dignitary up from london on the train to make a speech  
 break a bottle of champagne over the bows  launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea 
  occasionally on a really important ship they 'd get a member of the royal family to come duke of edinburgh  princess anne or somebody and you
 have to remember it wasn 't that long ago that the royal family in england were considered to have
 magical healing powers  sick children were held up in crowds to try and touch the
 cloak of the king or the queen to cure them of some terrible disease  
  it wasn 't like that in my day but we still got very excited  so it 's a launch day it 's a saturday  and my mother has dressed me up in my sunday best i 'm not very happy with her 
 all the kids are out in the street and we have little union jacks to wave 
 and at the top of the hill there 's a motorcycle cortege appears in the middle of the motorcycles there 's a big black
  procession is moving at a stately pace down my street and as it approaches
 my house i start to wave my flag vigorously  and there is the queen mother i see her  and she seems to see me 
 she acknowledges me she waves  and she smiles and i wave my flag even more
 vigorously we 're having a moment me and the queen mother she 's
 acknowledged me
  she 's gone well  i wasn 't cured of anything
 it was the opposite actually i was
 infected i
 was infected with an idea i don 't belong in this street  
 i don 't want to live in that house  i don 't want to end up in that shipyard  i want to be in that car
  i want a bigger life i want a life
 beyond this town i want a life that 's out of the ordinary it 's my right it 's my right as much as hers and
 so here i am at ted  i suppose to tell that story
 that there 's a symbiotic and intrinsic link
 between storytelling and community between community and art  between community and science and technology 
 between community and economics  it 's my belief that
 that
 abstract economic theory that denies the needs of community or or denies the
  contribution that community makes to economy is shortsighted  cruel and untenable the
 fact is whether you 're a rock star or whether you 're
 a welder in a shipyard or a a tribesman
  in the upper amazon or the queen of england at the end of the day
  on the tyne at high tide
 from far and from wide there 's
  in the name of the son
  makes its way to the sea
  an
  ask you to sing after me
  so it 's
