  if you haven 't ordered yet 
 i generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine so 
 sorry it just feels like i should be doing stand up up here because of the setting no what i want to do is
  back
 to one thousand eight hundred and fifty four in london for the next few minutes and tell the story
 in brief of this of this outbreak  which in many ways  
 i think helped create the world that we live in today and particularly the kind of city that we live in today this period in one thousand eight hundred and fifty four in the middle part of the 19th
  in london 's history is incredibly interesting
 for a number of reasons but i think the most important one is that
 london was this city of two point five million people 
 and it was the largest city on the on the face of the planet at that point but it was also the largest city that had ever been built  and so the victorians were trying to
 live through and and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living this scale of living that we
 in many ways at this point in the 
 a complete disaster 
 they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure 
 so people for instance just to gross you out for a second
 had cesspools of human waste in their basement
  a foot to two feet deep  and they would just kind of
 throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away and of course it never really would go away
 and all of this stuff basically had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in it was an amazingly smelly city
  not just because of the cesspools but also the the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people not just the horses but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk that they would
  up there and keep them in the attic until until literally their milk ran out and they died and then they would drag them off
 to the bone boilers down the street so you would just walk around london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this
 with this stench  and what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was
  everybody that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years and cholera was really the great killer of this period it arrived in london in 
 and every four or five years another epidemic would take
 ten thousand twenty thousand people in london and and throughout the  u k 
 and so the authorities became convinced that this this smell was this problem we had to get rid of the smell
  and so in fact
 they concocted a couple of early you know founding public health interventions in the system of the city 
 one of which was called the nuisances act which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools
 and
 just pour all that waste into the river because if we get it out of the streets it 'll smell much better  and oh right we drink from the river
  so what ended up happening actually
 is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because as we now know cholera is actually in the water it 's a waterborne disease not something that 's in the air it 's not something you smell
 or inhale it 's something you ingest  and so one of the founding moments of public health in in the 19th century
 effectively poisoned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing so
  was the state of london in one thousand eight hundred and fifty four and in the middle of all this carnage and
 offensive conditions  and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people it was a very
 talented classic  19th century
  who was a local doctor in soho in london who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was in fact a waterborne disease
  and had basically convinced nobody of this the public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say  
 and
 he 'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies but nothing had really stuck and part of what 's so interesting about this story to me is is that in some ways it 's a great case study in how cultural change happens how a good idea eventually comes
 to win out over over much worse ideas  and snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored  and then on one day  
 august 28th of 
 a young child a five month old girl whose first name we don 't know we know her only as baby lewis
  somehow contracted cholera came down with cholera at forty broad street you can 't really see it in this
 this is the map that
 becomes the central focus in the second half of my book it 's in the middle of soho in this working class neighborhood this little girl becomes sick
 and it turns out that the cesspool that they still continue to have despite the nuisances act  bordered on an extremely popular
 water pump local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of soho that all the residents from soho and the surrounding
  neighborhoods would go to and so this little girl inadvertently ended up
 contaminating the water in this popular pump  and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of
 of england erupted about two or three days later  literally ten percent of the neighborhood died in in seven days and much more would have died if people hadn 't fled after the
 terrifying event you had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of forty eight hours of cholera  alone in their one room apartments
 in their little flats  just an extraordinary terrifying scene snow
 lived near there  heard about the outbreak and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually
  potentially end up convincing people
 that in fact the real menace of cholera was was in the water supply and and not in the air he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably
 involve a single point source one single thing that that everybody was going to because it didn 't have the traditional slower path
  of infections that you might expect  and so he went right in there and and started interviewing people he eventually enlisted the the help
 of of this amazing other figure who 's kind of the other protagonist of the book
 this guy henry whitehead who was a local minister who was not at all a man of science  but was incredibly socially connected he knew everybody in the neighborhood  
 and he managed to track down whitehead did many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump or who hadn 't drunk water from the pump  
 and eventually snow made
 a map
 of the outbreak
 he found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick people who hadn 't drunk from the pump were not getting sick 
 and he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods people who hadn 't you know percentages of people who hadn 't but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could 
  see something that would take in a sense a higher level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood  and so he created this
 this map  which basically
 ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address 
 and you can see in this map the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about fifteen people dead 
 and the map is actually a little bit bigger as you get further and further away from the pump the deaths begin to
 grow less and less frequent  and so you can see this
  something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance  
 and so with the help of this map and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that whitehead did 
 eventually actually the authorities slowly started to come around it took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story but by 
  when the next big cholera outbreak came to london the authorities had been convinced in in part because of this story in part because of this map
 that in fact the water was the problem  and they had already started building the sewers in london and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water 
 and that was the last time that london has seen a cholera outbreak since 
 so part of this story i think well it 's a terrifying
  a very dark story and it 's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world
  it 's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic which is to say that it 's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps 
 if we listen to people like snow and whitehead if we listen to the locals who understand what 's going on in in these kinds of situations  
  the idea of large scale metropolitan living a sustainable one
