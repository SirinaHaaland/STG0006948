  i was
 thinking about female friendship a lot  and by the way  these two women i 'm very honored to say have been my friends for a very long time too jane fonda yes we have 
 pm and one of the things that i read about female friendship is something that cervantes said he said
  you can tell a lot about someone in this case a woman by the company that she keeps
 we have a very limited lt just being with her sucks the life out of me jf 
 you ain 't seen nothing yet  anyway
 sorry pm so tell me what do you look for in a friend lt i look for someone who has a sense of fun who 's
 audacious
  who 's forthcoming who has politics who has
 even a small scrap of passion for the planet  
 someone who 's decent has a sense of justice and who thinks i 'm worthwhile jf you know
 i was thinking this morning i don 't even know what i would do without my women friends i mean it 's 
  you know they make me stronger  they make me smarter  they make me braver  they tap me on the shoulder when i might be in need of  course correcting 
 and most of them are a good deal younger than me too you know  i
  i include you in that because listen  you know it 's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from when you 're getting toward the end
 i 'm approaching i 'll be there sooner than you lt no i 'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me jf 
 i 'm showing you the way lt 
 well you are and you have pm well as we grow older and as we go through different kinds of life 's journeys what do you do to keep
  your friendships vital and alive lt 
 well you have to use a lot of jf she doesn 't invite me over much i 'll tell you that lt i have to use a lot of social media you be quiet now  and 
  i look through my emails i look through my texts to find my friends so i can answer them as quickly as possible because i
  they need my support because most of my friends are writers or activists or actors and you 're all three and a long string of other descriptive phrases
  and i
 i want to get to you as soon as possible i want you to know that i 'm there for you jf do you do
  happiness and congratulations and sadness jf you spell it right out lt i spell it every letter jf 
 such a purist  you know  as i 've gotten older  i 've
 understood more the importance of friendships and so i really make an effort to reach out and
 make play dates not let too much time go by i read a lot so as lily knows all too well
  my books that i like i send to my friends lt when we knew we would be here today you sent me a lot of books about women female friendships and i was so surprised to see how many 
  books how much research has been done recently jf and were you grateful lt i was grateful pm 
  it 's really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked  put aside marginalized there 's been very little research done on us 
 even though we volunteered lots of times jf that 's for sure
 lt this is really exciting and you all will be interested in this the harvard medical school study has shown that women who have close female friendships
 are less likely to
  impairments physical impairments as they age  and
 they are are likely to be seen to be living much more vital exciting jf and longer lt joyful lives jf we live five years longer than men lt i think i 'd trade the years for joy lt 
 but the most important part is they found the results were so so exciting and so conclusive the
 the researchers found that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health as much as smoking or being overweight
  only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we 're stressed and it turns out that when we 're stressed women our bodies get flooded by oxytocin
  which is a feel good calming stress reducing hormone which is also increased when we 're with our women friends
  and i do think that 's one reason why we we live longer and i feel so bad for men because they don 't have that testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin lt well when you and i and dolly made nine to five 
 jf oh lt we laughed we did we laughed so much we found we had so much in common and we 're so different here she is like hollywood royalty i 'm like a tough kid from detroit [ dolly
 's ] a southern
  kid from a poor town in in
 tennessee  and we found we were so in sync as women 
 and we must have we laughed we must have added at least a decade onto  our lifespans jf
 i think we sure crossed our legs a lot
  that jane sent us both to read on female friendship
 was one by a woman we admire greatly sister joan chittister who said about female friendship that
 women women friends are not just a social act they 're a spiritual act do you think of your friends  as spiritual do they add something
  especially people you 've known a long time 
 people you 've spent time with i can see the spiritual essence inside them the tenderness the vulnerability
  there 's actually kind of a love an element of love in the relationship i just see deeply into your soul
  friends there 's business friends and party friends i 've got a lot of those but the the
  friendships have 
 they feel spiritual because it 's a heart opening right  you know  we go deep and
 i find that i shed tears a lot with my
  not because i 'm sad but because i 'm so touched and inspired by them lt and you know one of you is going to go soon
  little mystified
 what are the differences in your opinion   between men friendships and and women  friendships jf there 's a lot of difference  and i think we have to have a lot of empathy for men
 that they don
 't have what we have which i think may be why they die sooner
  i have a lot of compassion for men because women no kidding we
 women 's relationships our friendships are are full disclosure  we go deep  they 're revelatory
 we risk vulnerability this is something men don 't do i mean how many times have i asked you am i doing ok did i
  we ask questions like that of our women friends   and men don 't you know people describe women 's relationships as 
 whereas men 's friendships are more 
 i mean most of the time men don 't want to reveal their emotions they want to bury deeper feelings i mean that 's the general 
 conventional thought they would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or
  hit golf balls or talk about sports or hunting or cars or have sex  i mean it 's just the kind of it 's a more manly behavior jf 
 you meant lt they talk about sex  i meant they might have sex if they could get somebody in their man cave to jf 
 you know something though that i find very interesting and again psychologists didn 't know this until relatively
  recently
 is that men are born every bit as relational as women are if you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls you 'll see the baby boys just like the girls gazing 
 into their mother 's eyes  you know  needing that relational
  the dismay on the child even the boy would would cry they need relationship so the question is why as they grow older 
 does that change  and the answer is patriarchal culture which says to to boys and young men
 that to to be needing of relationship to be emotional with someone is is girly that a real man doesn 't ask directions or express a
  they don 't go to doctors if they feel bad they don 't ask for help there 's a quote that i really like men fear that becoming ' we '
 will erase his ' i ' you know his sense of self whereas women 's sense of self has always been kind of porous  
 but our we is our saving grace  it 's what makes us
 strong it 's not that we 're better
  it 's a great quote i think we 're not better than men we just don 't have our masculinity to prove  and that 's really important lt but men are so inculcated in the
 culture to to be comfortable in the patriarchy  and we 've got to make something different happen
 jf women 's friendships are like a renewable source of power  lt well that 's what 's exciting about this subject it 's because our friendships female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood 
 and sisterhood can be a very powerful
 force to give the world to make it what it should
 be the things that humans desperately need pm 
 it is why we 're talking about it because women 's friendships are as you said jane a renewable source of power so how do we use that power jf 
 well  women are the fastest growing demographic in the world especially older women and if we harness
 our power we can change the world and guess what we need to
  it as women for one thing  we kind of set the consumer standards we need to consume less we in the western world
 need to consume less and when we buy things we need to buy things that are made locally when we buy food we need to buy food that 's grown locally  we are the ones that need to get off the grid  we need to
 make ourselves independent from fossil fuels and
  the fossil fuel companies the exxons and the shell oils and those bad guys cause they are
 are going to tell us that we can 't do it without going back to the stone age you know that the alternatives just aren 't quite there yet and that 's not true 
 there are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine and they tell us that if we do
 wean ourselves from fossil fuel that we 're going to be back in the stone
  age  and in fact if we begin to use renewable energy and not drill in the arctic and not drill
  world with women we don 't see women we may never meet but we join together that way  because aristotle said
 most people people would die without male friendships and the operative word here was male
 because they thought that friendships should be between
  the best part it 's like you know men do need women now the planet needs women the
 us constitution needs women we are not even in the constitution  jf 
  every constitution that 's been written since the end of world war ii included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature but ours does not 
 so that would be a good place to start very 
 very mild
  it would lift all boats not just
 women pm needing new role models on how to do that how to be friends how to think about our power in different ways as consumers as citizens of the world 
 and this is what makes jane and lily a role model of how women can be friends for a very long time and even if they occasionally
