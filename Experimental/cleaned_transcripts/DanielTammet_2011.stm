  i 'm a savant or more precisely a 
 autistic savant it 's a rare condition and rarer still when
  a mastery of language 
 very often when i meet someone and they learn this about me there 's a certain kind of awkwardness  
 i can see it in their eyes they want to ask me something  
 and in the end  quite often the urge is stronger than they are
 and they blurt it out if i give you my
 date of birth can you tell me what day of the week i was born on 
 or they mention cube roots or
 ask me to recite a long number or long text  i hope you 'll forgive me
 if i don 't perform a kind of one man savant show for you
  i 'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots
 a little deeper
 and a lot closer to my mind than work  i want to talk to you briefly about perception 
 when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make
  anton chekhov
 kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him little details
 that other people seem to miss every time i read chekhov
 and his unique vision of human life  i 'm reminded of why i too became
  in my books  i explore the nature of perception
 and how different kinds of perceiving
 create different kinds of knowing and understanding 
 here are three questions drawn from my work  
 rather than try to figure them out  i 'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions
 and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your
 heart as you look at them 
 for example  the calculation 
 can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall or look at the foreign word and the sounds 
 can you get a sense of the range of meanings
 that it 's pointing you towards  and in terms
  of the line of poetry why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit  
 i 'm asking you to do this because i believe
 our personal perceptions you see are at
 the heart of how we acquire knowledge  aesthetic judgments  rather than abstract reasoning 
 guide and shape the process by which we all come to know
 what we know
 i 'm an extreme example of this 
 my worlds of words and numbers  blur with color emotion and personality  
 as juan said it 's the condition that scientists call synesthesia an
 unusual cross talk between the senses 
 here are the numbers one to twelve
 as i see them
 every number with its own shape
 and character one is a flash of white light six
 is a tiny and very sad black hole  the sketches are in black and white here but in my mind they have colors  
 three is green  four is blue  five is yellow
  i paint as well and here is one of my paintings it 's a multiplication of two prime numbers 
 three dimensional shapes
 and the space they create in the middle
 creates a new shape the answer to the sum what about bigger numbers
  you can 't get much bigger than pi  the mathematical constant it 's an infinite number
 literally goes on forever in this painting that i made
 of the first twenty decimals of pi  i take the colors
 and the emotions and the textures and i pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape
  but it 's not only numbers that i see in colors words too for me have colors
 and emotions and textures 
 and this is an opening phrase from the novel lolita 
 and nabokov was himself synesthetic and you can see here how my perception of the sound l
 helps the alliteration
 to jump right out  another example a little bit more mathematical and i wonder if some of you will
 notice the construction of the sentence from the great gatsby 
 there is a procession of syllables wheat one
  and this effect is very pleasant on the mind  and it helps the sentence to feel right 
 let 's go back to the questions i posed you a moment ago
  number and that 's why
 chessboards eight by eight have  sixty four squares  so that gives us a form
 that we can picture that we can perceive what about 
 well if one hundred if we think of one hundred as being like a square seventy five would look like this
 so what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind
 something like this
 becomes six thousand four hundred  and in the right hand corner you don 't have to calculate anything four
  up and down it 's sixteen  so what the sum is actually asking you to do is  sixteen 
 sixteen  that 's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math i 'm sure it 's sixteen sixteen sixteen
  the second question
 was an icelandic word  i 'm assuming
 there are not many people here who speak icelandic  so let me narrow the choices down to two
 is it a happy word or a sad word what
  some people say it 's happy  most people a majority of people say sad  and
 it actually means sad 
 why do statistically a majority of people say that a word is
 sad in this case  heavy in other cases in my theory  language evolves in such a way
  that sounds match  correspond with the subjective with the personal intuitive experience
 of the listener 
 let 's have a look at the the third question it 's a line from a poem by john keats 
  express fundamental relationships
 between objects and events and forces that constitute our world it stands to reason that we existing in this world  
 should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively
 those relationships and poets like other artists play with those intuitive understandings
  in the case of hare it 's an ambiguous sound
 in english it can also mean the fibers that grow from a head and if we think of that let me put the picture up
 the fibers represent vulnerability they yield to the slightest movement or motion
 or emotion so
 what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension  the hare itself the animal
 not a cat not a dog a hare why a hare because
 think of the picture not the word the picture  the overlong
 ears  the overlarge feet helps us to picture to feel intuitively what it means
 to limp
  in these few minutes  i hope i 've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things
 and to show you that words can have colors and emotions numbers  shapes and personalities 
 the world is richer  vaster
 than it too often seems to be  i hope that
 i 've given you the desire to learn to see
  world with new eyes  thank you
