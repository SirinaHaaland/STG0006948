  here today to talk about a disturbing question  which has an equally disturbing answer 
 my topic is the secrets of domestic violence and the question i 'm going to tackle
 is the one question everyone always asks why
  does she stay  why would anyone stay with a man who beats her  
 i 'm not a psychiatrist a social worker or an expert in domestic violence  i 'm just one woman with a story to tell 
 i was twenty two i had just graduated from harvard college  i had moved to new york city for
  my first job as a writer and editor at seventeen magazine  
 i had my first apartment my first little green american express card  and i had a very big secret 
 my secret was
 that i had this gun
 loaded with hollow point bullets pointed at my head
 by the man who i thought was my soulmate  many  many times the man who i loved more than anybody on earth
  held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me
 more times than i can even remember 
 i 'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love 
 one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year  
 it may even be your story 
 i don 't look like a typical domestic violence survivor  i have a b a in english from
  harvard college an mba in marketing from wharton business school 
 i 've spent most of my career working for fortune five hundred companies including johnson & johnson  leo burnett and the washington post  
 i 've been married for almost twenty years to my second husband
 and we have three kids together my dog is a black lab  and i drive a honda
  so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone
 all races all religions all income and education levels it 's everywhere 
 and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women that it 's a women 's issue 
 not exactly over
  percent of abusers are men 
 and domestic abuse happens only in intimate  interdependent long term relationships in other words in families 
 the last place we would want or expect to find violence  which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing  
 i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me but
 in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age i was
 twenty two and in the united states  women ages sixteen to twenty four are three times as likely
 to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages  
 and over five hundred women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners  
 boyfriends and husbands in the united states  
 i was also a very typical
  victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence its warning signs or its patterns  
 i met conor on a cold rainy january night  
 he sat next to me on the new york city subway  and he started chatting me up 
 he told me two things one was that he too had just graduated from an ivy league school and that he worked at a very impressive wall street
  bank
 but what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny
 and he looked like a farm boy  he had these big cheeks these big apple cheeks and this wheat blond hair  and he seemed so sweet 
 one of the smartest things conor did from the very
  was to create the illusion that i was the dominant partner in the relationship  he did this especially at the beginning
 by idolizing me  
 we started dating  and he loved everything about me that i was smart that i 'd gone to harvard that i was passionate about helping teenage girls and my job  
 he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams 
 conor believed in me  as a writer and a woman in a way that no one else
 ever had and he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us
 by confessing his secret  
 which was that as a very young boy starting at age four he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather  
 and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade even though he was very smart and he 'd spent
  almost twenty years rebuilding his life  which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
 meant so much to him  if you had told me
 that this smart  funny sensitive man who adored me
 would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup  how short my skirts were
 where i lived what jobs i took who my friends were and where i spent christmas  i would have laughed at you 
 because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor
 at the beginning  i didn 't know
 that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim i also didn 't know that the second step
  step is to isolate the victim 
 now conor did not come home one day and announce 
 you know hey all this romeo and juliet stuff has been great  but i need to move into the next phase where i isolate you and i abuse you 
 so i need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises
  instead  conor came home one friday evening
 and he told me that he had quit his job that day his dream job 
 and he said that he had quit his job because of me  
 because i had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn 't need to prove himself on wall street anymore  
 and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive dysfunctional family
 and move to a tiny town in new england where he could start his life over with me by his side 
 now the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york and my my dream job  
 but i thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate so i agreed  and i quit my job and conor and i left manhattan together 
 i had no idea
 i was falling into crazy love 
 that i was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical financial and psychological trap 
 the next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence
 and see how she reacts and here 's where those guns come in as soon as we moved to new england
 you know that place where connor was supposed to feel so safe
 he bought three guns 
 he kept one in the glove compartment of our car 
 he kept one under the pillows on our bed and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times  
 and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he 'd experienced as a young boy  he needed them to feel protected  but those guns were really a message for me
 and even though he hadn 't raised a hand to me my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day 
 conor first physically attacked me
 five days before our wedding 
 it was seven  a m i still had on my nightgown  
 i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment and i got frustrated
 and conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck
 and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream and he used the chokehold
 to hit my head repeatedly against the wall 
 five days later  the ten bruises on my neck had just faded  and i put on my mother 's wedding dress  and i
  married him  
 despite what had happened  i was sure we were going to live happily ever after 
 because i loved him  and he loved me so much
  and he was very very sorry  he had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me  
 it was an isolated incident and he was never going to hurt me again
 it happened twice more on the honeymoon  the first time  i was driving to find a secret beach
 and i got lost  and he punched me in the side of my head so hard
 that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window 
 and then a few days later driving home from our honeymoon  he got frustrated by traffic  and he threw a cold big mac in my face
 conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage  
 i was mistaken in thinking that i was unique and alone in this situation 
 one in three american women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life 
 and the cdc reports that fifteen million children are abused every year fifteen
  million so actually  i was in very good company  
 back to my question  why did i stay  
 the answer is easy  i didn 't know he was abusing me  even though he held those loaded guns to my head 
 pushed me down stairs threatened to kill our dog pulled the key out of the car ignition as i drove down the highway  poured coffee grinds on my head
 as i dressed for a job interview  i never once thought of myself as a battered wife  
 instead  i was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man  and i was the only person on earth
 who could help conor face his demons 
 the other question everybody asks
  is why doesn 't she just leave  why didn 't i walk out i could have left any time 
 to me this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask  
 because we victims know something you usually don 't it 's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser 
 because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her
 over seventy percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship  
 after she 's gotten out  because then the abuser has nothing left to lose 
 other outcomes include long term stalking even after the abuser remarries  denial of
  and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children who are regularly forced by family court judges
 to spend unsupervised time
 with the man who beat their mother and still we ask  why doesn 't she just leave  
 i was able to leave because of one final sadistic beating that broke through my denial 
  realized that the man who i loved so much
 was going to kill me if i let him  so i broke the silence  i told everyone  
 the police my neighbors my friends and family  total strangers  
 and i 'm here today
 because you all helped me
  we tend to stereotype victims
 as grisly headlines self destructive women damaged goods 
 the question why does she stay is code for some people
 for it 's her fault for staying as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us 
 but since publishing
  crazy love i have heard hundreds of stories from men and women
 who also got out who learned an invaluable life lesson
 from what happened 
 and who rebuilt lives joyous  happy lives as employees wives and mothers lives completely free of violence
  a typical domestic violence survivor
 right now maybe you 're thinking wow this is fascinating or wow  how stupid was she 
 but this whole time  i 've actually been talking about you i promise you
 there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused
 or who were abused as
  children
 or who are abusers themselves 
 abuse could be affecting your daughter your sister your best friend right now  
 i was able to end my own crazy love story
 by breaking the silence  i 'm still breaking the silence today it 's my way of helping other victims and it 's my final
  request of you 
 talk about what you heard here abuse thrives only in silence 
 you have the power to end domestic violence
 simply by shining a spotlight on it we victims need everyone we need every one of you
 to understand the secrets of domestic violence
 show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and family  
 recast survivors as wonderful lovable people
 with full futures  recognize the early signs of violence
 and conscientiously
  show victims a safe way out together
 we can make our beds our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be thank you
