  i 'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that 's going to tell you a little bit about how we open
  john philip sousa 
 traveled to this place the united states capitol to talk about this technology what he called the quote talking machines 
 sousa was not a fan of the talking machines this is what he had to say these talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country 
 when i was a boy in front of every house
  in the summer evenings you would find young people together singing the songs of the day  or the old songs  
 today you hear these infernal machines going night and day  
 we will not have a vocal chord left sousa said the vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution as was the tail of man when he came from the ape
  now this is the picture i want you to focus on this is a picture of culture 
 we could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of
 culture  it 's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re creation of their culture in that sense it 's
  sousa 's fear
 was that we would lose that capacity because of these quote infernal machines they would take it away  
 and in its place we 'd have the opposite of read write culture what we could call
 culture culture where creativity was consumed but the consumer is not a creator a culture
  where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost  now as you look back
 at the twentieth century at least in what we think of as the quote developed world 
 hard not to conclude that sousa was right  
 never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized never before as concentrated
  never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced and displaced because of these quote infernal machines 
 the twentieth century was that century where at least for those places we know the best 
 culture moved from this read write to 
 existence 
 so second land is a kind of property it is property it 's protected by law
  as lord blackstone described it land is protected by trespass law 
 for most of the history of trespass law by presuming it protects the land all the way down below
 and to an indefinite extent upward now that
 was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land until this technology came along  and people began to wonder
  wonder were these instruments trespassers
 as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country well in one thousand nine hundred and forty five supreme court got a chance to address that question  
 two farmers thomas lee and tinie 
 who raised chickens had a significant complaint because
  of these technologies the complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls of the
 barn when the airplanes flew over the land and so they appealed to lord blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing  
 since time immemorial the law
  had said you can 't fly over the land without permission of the landowner so this flight must stop  
 well the supreme court considered this 
  tradition
 and said in an opinion written by justice douglas that the causbys must lose  
 the supreme court said the doctrine protecting land all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world otherwise
  flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits  
 common sense a rare idea in the law but here it was common sense 
 revolts at the idea  common sense 
 finally  before
 the
  the last great terror to rain down on the content industry
 was a terror created by this technology 
 broadcasting a new way to spread content 
 and therefore a new battle over the control of the businesses that would spread
 content  now at that time the
  the legal cartel that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ascap they
 had an exclusive license on the most popular content and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters
 who really was in charge so between
  finally got together and said okay enough of this and in one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine a lawyer sydney kaye started something called broadcast music inc we
 know it as bmi  
 and bmi was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire including african american music for the first time in the repertoire  
 but most important
 was that bmi took public domain works
 and made arrangements of them which they gave away for free to their subscribers  
 so that in one thousand nine hundred and forty when ascap threatened to double their rates the majority of broadcasters switched to bmi 
 now ascap said they didn 't care  the people will revolt  they predicted
  because the very best music was no longer available because they had shifted to the second best
 public domain provided by bmi  
 well  they didn 't revolt  and in one thousand nine hundred and forty one ascap cracked 
 and the important point to recognize is that even though these
 broadcasters were broadcasting something you would call second best that competition was enough to break
  at that time this legal cartel over access to music  okay three stories here 's the argument 
 in my view the most significant thing to recognize about what this internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read write culture that sousa romanticized
  digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to congress about
 content spreading in businesses in extraordinarily valuable ways like these celebrating amateur culture 
 by which i don 't mean amateurish culture  i mean culture where people produce for the love of what they 're doing and not for the money 
 i mean the culture
 that your kids are producing
 all the time 
 for when you think of what sousa romanticized in the young people together singing the songs of the day of the old songs you should recognize what your kids are doing right now  
 taking the songs of the day and the old songs and remixing them to make them something
  how they understand
 access to this culture 
 so let 's have some very few examples to get a sense of what i 'm talking about here here 's something called anime music video first example taking anime
 captured from television
  you should be confidence jesus survives
  there 's only you in
 the
  it 's important to emphasize that what this is not is
  i 'm not talking about nor justifying people taking other people 's content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner i 'm talking about people taking 
 and recreating using other people 's content using digital technologies to say things differently now the importance of this is not the technique that you 've seen here 
  of course every technique that you 've seen here is something that television and film producers have been able to do for the last fifty years the importance is that that technique has been democratized  
 it is now anybody with access to a $ one thousand five hundred
 computer
 who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently these tools of creativity have become tools of speech
  a literacy for this generation  this is how our kids speak 
 it is how our kids think it is what your kids are as they increasingly understand digital technologies and their relationship
 to themselves now in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies
  the law has not greeted this sousa revival with very much common sense  
 instead the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies as they interact have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal 
 because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies then in the digital world the one fact we can 't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy 
  use therefore requires permission without permission you are a trespasser you 're a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were trespassers
  common sense here  though has not yet revolted
 in response to this response that the law has offered to
  these forms of creativity instead what we 've seen is something much worse than a revolt  
 there 's a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate 
 in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies one side
 builds new technologies such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like youtube
 any content that has any copyrighted content in it whether or not
  not there 's a judgment of fair use that might be applied to the use of that content  and on the other side among our kids 
 there 's a growing copyright abolitionism 
 a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored
 and to be fought at every
  opportunity possible  the extremism on one side begets extremism on the other a fact we should have learned many many times
 over and both extremes in this debate are just wrong now the balance
 that i try to fight for i as any good liberal try to fight for
  looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense  it failed partly because the courts are too passive partly because
 the legislatures are corrupted by which i don 't mean that there 's bribery operating to stop real change but more the economy of influence that 
 governs how congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand
  this until it 's too late to fix it so we need something different 
 we need a different kind of solution and the solution here in my view is a private solution 
 a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again and to realize the economic potential of that and that 's where the story of bmi becomes relevant
  as bmi demonstrated competition here can achieve some form of balance 
 the same thing can happen now  we don 't have a public domain to draw upon now so instead what we need is two types of changes first 
 that artists and creators embrace the idea  choose
 that their work be made available more freely so for example they can say their work is available
  of use but not freely for any commercial use  and second  
 we need the businesses that are building out this read write culture to embrace this opportunity expressly to enable it 
 so that this ecology of free content or freer content can grow on a neutral platform
 where they both exist simultaneously
  and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lessons of the other now  i would talk about one particular such plan 
  that i know something about but i don 't want to violate ted 's first commandment of selling so i 'm not going to talk about this at all i 'm instead just going to remind you
 choice
 is the key for new technology having an opportunity to be open for business and we need to build artist choice here if these new technologies are to have that opportunity but let me end with something i think much more important
 much more important than business it 's the point about how this connects to
  we have to recognize they 're different from us this is us right 
 we made mixed tapes they remix music we watched tv  they make tv
