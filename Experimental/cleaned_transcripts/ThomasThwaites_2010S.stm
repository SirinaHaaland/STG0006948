  if we look around us  much of what surrounds us started life as
 various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world  but of course 
  look like rocks and sludge now they look like
 tv cameras monitors
  annoying radio mics and so this magical transformation is what i was trying to get at with my project which became known as the toaster project  and it was also inspired 
  by this quote from douglas adams and the situation is from the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy and the situation it describes is the hero of the book he 's a 20th century man finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically
  primitive people  and he kind of assumes that yes 
  these villagers he 'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements but of course  realizes that without the rest of human society 
 he can
 barely make a sandwich let alone a toaster  but he didn 't have wikipedia  so i thought
 okay i 'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch and working on the
 the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse engineer i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find 
 took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover
 that inside this object which i 'd bought for just
  there were four hundred different bits made out of
 a  hundred plus different materials  i didn 't have the rest of my life to to do this project i
 had maybe nine months so i thought okay i 'll start with five and these were steel mica plastic copper and nickel 
 so starting with steel how do you make steel  i went and
 knocked on the door of the rio tinto chair of advanced mineral extraction at the royal school
  of mines and said how do you make steel and professor cilliers was very kind and talked me through it 
 and my vague rememberings from  gcse science well steel comes from iron  so i phoned up an iron mine and said 
 hi i 'm trying to make a toaster can i come up and get some
 iron 
  when i got there emerges ray
  he had misheard me and thought i was coming up because i was trying to make a poster  and so wasn 't prepared to take me into the mines but after some nagging i got him to do that
  when you study geology you can see
 what 's happened in the past and there were terrific
 changes in the earth thomas thwaites 
 as you can see they had the christmas decorations up and of course  it wasn 't actually a working mine
  though ray was a miner there the mine had closed and had
 been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction because of course it can 't compete
 on the scale of operations which are happening in south america  australia  wherever  but anyway i got my
 my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to london on the train and then was faced with the problem okay how do you make this rock into components for a toaster  so i went back to professor cilliers and he said
  to the library so i did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy
 completely useless for what i was trying to do because of course they don 't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself
 and you don 't have a smelting plant  
 so i ended up going to the history of science library and looking at this book this is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the west at least and there you can see that woodcut
 is basically what i ended up doing but instead of a
 bellows i had a leaf blower  
 and that was something that reoccurred throughout the project was the smaller the scale you want to work on the further back in time you have to go
  and so this is
 after a day and and about half a night smelting this iron i dragged out this stuff and it wasn 't iron
  but
 luckily
  i found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves and at thirty minutes at full power  and i was able to finish off the process
 so my next 
 the next thing i was trying to get was
  this mine
 was once the largest copper mine in the world it 's
 not anymore  but i found a a retired geology professor to take me down  and he said okay i 'll let you have some water from the mine 
 and the reason i was interested in getting water is because
 water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and
 will start picking up dissolving the minerals from the mine and a good example of this is the rio tinto  which is in portugal 
 as you can see it 's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it 
 so many such that it 's now just a home for
 bacteria who really like acidic toxic conditions  but anyway the water i dragged back from the isle of anglesey where the mine was there was enough copper in it such that i could cast the pins of my metal electric plug
  thing i was off to scotland to get mica  and mica is a mineral
 which is a very good insulator and very good
 at insulating electricity that 's me getting mica  and the last material i 'm going to talk about today is plastic
  my toaster had to have a plastic case 
 plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods  and so plastic comes from oil so i phoned up bp and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the 
 pr office at bp that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil  bp obviously has a bit more on their mind now
 never did  so i looked at other ways of making plastic and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants but also from starches so this 
  is attempting to make potato starch plastic  and for a while that was looking really good i poured it into the mold which you can see there which i 've made from a tree trunk  and it was looking good for a while but i left it outside because you had to leave it outside to dry
  unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato  so
 kind of out of desperation i decided
 that i could think laterally  and geologists have actually christened well they 're debating whether to christen the age that we 're living in
 they 're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the anthropocene the age of man  and that 's because
  geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now  so suddenly it will become kind of radioactive from chernobyl and the two thousand or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since one thousand nine hundred and
 forty five and there 'd also be an extinction event
 like fossils would suddenly disappear
  embedded in the rock  so
 i looked up a plastic so i decided that i could mine some of this modern day rock
  and i went up to manchester to visit a place called axion recycling  and they 're at the sharp end of what 's called the weee  which is this european electrical and electronic
  and that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being
 made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill but
 this
  there 's a picture of my toaster 
 applause that 's it without the case on and there it is on the shelves
  did plug it in i don 't know if you could see but i was never able to make insulation for the wires  kew gardens were insistent that i couldn 't come and
 hack into their rubber tree so the wires were uninsulated so there was two hundred and forty volts going through these
  and for about five seconds the toaster toasted  but then  unfortunately the element kind of melted itself  
 but i considered it a partial success
