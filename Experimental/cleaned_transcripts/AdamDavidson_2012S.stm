  friend of mine who 's a political scientist he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like he said you know there 's this fiscal cliff coming it 's going to
 come at the beginning
  of two thousand and thirteen both parties absolutely need to resolve it but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it  neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it 's due so he said december you 're just going to see lots of
 angry negotiations negotiations breaking apart reports of phone calls that aren 't going well people saying nothing 's happening at all and then sometime around christmas or new year 's we 're going to hear 
  he told me that a few months ago he said he 's ninety eight percent positive they 're going to resolve it  
 and i got an email from him today saying all right we 're basically on track  but now i 'm eighty percent positive that they 're going to resolve it  
 and it made me think i love studying these moments in american history when there was this frenzy of of partisan anger that the economy was on the verge of
  most famous early battle was alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up with alexander hamilton saying we need a central 
  bank the first bank of the united states or else the dollar will have no value  this economy won 't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won 't trust that they just fought off a king they 're not going to accept some central authority 
 and at every moment different partisans saying oh my god the economy 's about to collapse and the rest of us just going about spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy
  to give you a quick primer on where we are a quick refresher on where we are so the fiscal cliff
  i was told that that 's too partisan a thing to say although i can 't remember which party it 's supporting or attacking people say we should call it the
  fiscal slope or we should call it an austerity crisis but then other people say no that 's even more partisan so i just call it the 
  arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem  and
 this is what the inevitable problem looks like so this is a projection of u s debt as a percentage of our overall economy of gdp
  dotted line represents the congressional budget office 's best guess of what will happen if congress really doesn 't do anything  and as you can see sometime around 
  we reach greek levels of debt somewhere around one hundred and thirty percent of gdp  
 which tells you that some time in the next twenty years if congress does absolutely nothing we 're going to hit a moment where the world
  's investors the world 's bond buyers are going to say we don 't trust america anymore we 're not going to lend them any money  except at really high interest rates and at that moment our economy collapses 
 but remember greece is there today we 're there in twenty years we have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis
 here 's another way to look at exactly the same problem  the dark blue line is how much the government spends the light blue line is how much the government gets in and as you can see for most of recent history except for a brief period we
 have consistently spent more than we take in thus the national debt  but as you can also see  projected going forward the gap widens
  a bit and raises a bit and this graph is only through two thousand and twenty one it gets really really ugly out towards two thousand and thirty  
 and this graph sort of sums up what the problem is the democrats  they say well this isn 't a big deal we can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap especially if we raise
  got a better idea why don 't we lower both lines why don 't we lower government spending and lower government taxes and then we 'll be on an even more favorable 
  long term deficit trajectory 
 and behind this powerful disagreement between how to close that gap there 's the worst kind of cynical party politics
  the worst kind of insider
 baseball lobbying all of that stuff but there 's also this powerfully interesting  respectful disagreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophies  
 and
 i like to think when i picture how republicans see the economy what i picture is just some amazingly
  made in germany or japan  but this amazing machine that 's constantly scouring every
 bit of human endeavor and taking
 resources money labor capital machinery away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts and while this might cause temporary dislocation what it does is it
 builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and
  die and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient so much richer for everybody  and
 this view generally believes that there is a role for government a small role to set the rules so people aren 't lying and cheating and hurting each other maybe
  you know have a police force and a fire department and an army  but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery  
 and when i
  picture how democrats and 
 economists picture this economy  most democratic economists are you know they 're capitalists they believe yes that 's a good system a lot of the time it 's good to let markets move 
  resources to their more productive use  but that system has tons of problems
  called unproductive that 's not going to create an equitable fair society that machine doesn 't care about the environment about racism about all these issues that make this life 
 worse for all of us and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses or from richer sources  and give them to other sources
  when you think about the economy through these two different lenses 
 you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve  because the worse the crisis gets the higher the stakes are the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything
  and i can get really despairing i 've spent a lot of the last few years really depressed
  i learned something that i felt really excited about i feel like it 's really good news  and it 's so shocking i don 't like saying it because i think people won 't believe me 
 but here 's what i learned the american people taken as a whole when it comes to these issues to fiscal issues 
 are moderate  pragmatic centrists  and i know that 's hard to believe that the american people are
  let me explain what i 'm thinking  when you look at how the federal government spends money so this is the battle right here
 fifty five percent more than half is on social security medicare medicaid a few other health programs twenty percent defense nineteen percent discretionary  
 and six percent interest so
 when we 're talking about cutting government spending this is the pie we 're talking about and americans overwhelmingly and it doesn 't matter
  matter what party they 're in 
 overwhelmingly like that big fifty five percent chunk  they like social security  they like medicare they even like medicaid even though that goes to the poor and indigent which you might think would have less support  
 and they do not want it fundamentally touched although the american people are remarkably comfortable 
 and democrats roughly equal to republicans
  with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable social security is fairly easy to fix the rumors of its demise are always greatly 
  exaggerated so gradually raise social security retirement age maybe only on people not yet born 
  just reduce it 
 people generally
 are comfortable with it democrats and republicans 
 raise medical health care contributions everyone hates that equally but republicans and democrats hate that together  
 and so what this tells me is when you look at
 the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal
  we are not a nation that that 's powerfully divided on the major major issue  we 're comfortable with it needing some tweaks but we want to keep it we 're not open to a discussion of eliminating it  
 now there is one issue that
 is is hyper partisan and where there is one party that is just spend spend spend we don 't care spend some more and that of course is
  republicans when it comes to military defense spending they way outweigh democrats the vast majority want to protect
 military defense spending that 's twenty percent of the budget
  and that presents a more difficult issue  i should also note that the [ discretionary ] spending which is about nineteen percent of the budget that is democratic and 
  republican issues so you do have welfare food stamps other programs that tend to be popular among democrats but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of department
  of interior inducements for
 oil drilling and other things which tend to be popular among republicans 
 now when it comes to taxes there is more disagreement  that 's a more partisan area  
 you have democrats overwhelmingly supportive of raising the income tax on people who make two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year republicans
 sort of against it although if you break it out by income
 republicans who make less than seventy five thousand dollars a year like this idea so basically republicans who make more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year don 't want to be taxed
  raising taxes on investment income  you also see about two thirds of democrats but only one third of republicans are comfortable with that idea  
 this brings up a really
  which is that we tend in this country to talk about democrats and republicans and think there 's this little group over there called independents that 's what two percent 
 if you add democrats you add republicans you 've got the american people  but that is not the case at all  and it has not been the case for for most of modern american history 
 roughly a third of americans say that they are democrats around a quarter say that they are republicans a tiny little sliver call themselves
  libertarians or socialists or some other small third party and
 the largest block forty percent say they 're independents  
 so most americans are not partisan 
 and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between so even though we have tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues of democrats and republicans 
 we have even more
  more overlap when you add in the independents 
 now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues we get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment but on these fiscal issues these important fiscal issues 
  we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say  and in fact there 's this other group of people who are not as divided as
  talk to a lot of economists and
 back in the ' 70s and ' 80s it was ugly being an economist you were in what they called the saltwater camp meaning harvard princeton mit 
  stanford  berkeley or you were in the freshwater camp university of chicago university of rochester
  you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a keynesian liberal economist and these people didn 't go to each other 's weddings they snubbed each other at conferences it 's still ugly 
  to this day  but in my experience it is really really hard to find an economist under forty who still has that kind of way of seeing the world the vast majority of economists it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of
 either camp the phrase that you want if you 're a graduate student or a postdoc or you 're a professor a 38 year old economics professor is i 'm an empiricist i go by the data 
 and the data is very clear  none of these major theories have been completely successful the 20th century the last hundred years is riddled with disastrous examples 
 of of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful awful job
 the
 the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty
  they still are an awfully arrogant group of people i will assure you but they 're now arrogant about their impartiality 
 and they too see a tremendous range of of potential outcomes  
 and this nonpartisanship is
  that has existed in secret in america for years and years and years i 've spent a lot of the fall
 talking to the three major organizations that survey american political attitudes  pew research  the
 university of chicago 's national opinion research center  and the most important but the least known is the american national election studies group that is the world 's longest most respected poll of political attitudes they 've been doing it
 and forty eight and what they show consistently throughout is that
 it 's almost impossible to find americans who are consistent ideologically who consistently support no we mustn 
  't tax and we must limit the size of government or no we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the
  the ills of capitalism those groups are very very small  the vast majority of people they pick and choose they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument 
 and that that part of it has not changed 
 what has changed is how people respond to vague questions if you ask people vague questions like do you think there should be more government or less government
  government should
 especially if you use loaded language do you think the government should provide handouts or do you think the government should redistribute then you can see radical partisan change but when you get 
  specific when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration people are remarkably centrist
  they 're remarkably open to compromise so what we have then when you think about the fiscal cliff don 't think of it as
 the american people fundamentally can 't stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations 
 think of it as a tiny tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process and they 've captured the process through familiar ways
 a primary system which encourages that small group of people 's voices  because that small group of people the people who answer all yeses or all noes 
  on those ideological questions they might be small but every one of them has a blog every one of them has been on fox or msnbc in the last week 
  them becomes a louder and louder voice  but they don 't represent us  they don 't represent what our views are  and that gets me back to the dollar  and it
 gets me back to reminding myself that that we know this experience we know what it 's like to have
 these people on tv 
 in congress yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don 't adopt their view completely  because it 's happened about the dollar ever since there 's
  been a dollar  
 we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton in one thousand nine hundred and thirteen we had this ugly battle over the federal reserve when it was created with vicious angry
 arguments over how it would be constituted and a general agreement that the way it was constituted was the worst possible compromise a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing this dollar
  then everyone agreeing okay so long as we 're on the gold standard it should be okay the fed can 't mess it up so badly  but then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international
 currency coordination during richard nixon 's presidency each of those times we were on the verge
  verge of complete collapse  and nothing happened at all throughout it all the dollar has been one of the most
 stable  reasonable currencies and we all use it every single day  no matter what the people screaming about
 tell us no matter how how scared we 're supposed to be and
 this long term fiscal picture that we 're in right now i think what what is most maddening
  were simply able
 to show not that they agree with each other not that they 're able to come up with the best possible compromise  but that they are able to just
 begin the process towards compromise we all instantly are better off 
 the fear is that the world is watching the fear is that the longer we delay
 any solution the more the world will look to the u s not as the
  of stability in the global economy but as a place that can 't resolve its own fights 
 and the longer we put that off the more we make the world nervous  the higher interest rates are going to be the quicker we 're going to have to face a day of of horrible calamity  and so just the act of compromise itself and
  real compromise would give us even more time would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road
  between two fundamentally different
