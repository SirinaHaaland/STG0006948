  explain how these identities come together it started four years ago  when a friend and i opened our first ramadan fast at one of the busiest mosques in new york
  crowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets it was an fbi agent 's wet dream 
 but being a part of this community we knew how welcoming this space was for years i 'd seen photos of this space being documented as a lifeless and cold monolith  much like the stereotypical image painted of the american muslim experience  
 frustrated by this myopic view my friend and i had this crazy idea
  let 's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of ramadan and share those stories on a blog we called it thirty mosques in thirty days and we drove to all the fifty 
  states and shared stories from over one hundred vastly different muslim communities  ranging from the cambodian refugees in the l a projects to the black sufis living in the woods of south carolina 
  exciting was seeing people from around the world being inspired to take their own 30 mosque journey there were even these two nfl athletes who took a sabbatical from the league to do so  
 and as thirty mosques was blossoming around the world 
 i was actually stuck in pakistan working on a film my codirector omar and i were at a breaking point with many of our friends on how to position the
  the movie is called these birds walk and it is about wayward street kids who are struggling to find some semblance of family  
 we focus on the complexities of youth and family discord  
 but our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings to make the film more relevant essentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories into sociopolitical symbols 
 of course we didn 't listen to them  and instead we championed the tender gestures of love and headlong flashes of youth
  the agenda behind our cinematic immersion was only empathy an emotion that 's largely deficient from films that come from our region of the world  
 and as these birds walk played at film festivals and theaters internationally i finally had my feet planted at home in new york 
 and with all the extra time and still no real money 
  my wife tasked me to cook more for us
  and whenever i 'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat something felt off 
 for those that don 't know halal is a term used for meat that is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict islamic guidelines  
 unfortunately the majority of halal meat in america doesn 't rise to the standard that my faith calls for 
 the more i learned about these unethical practices the more violated i felt  
 particularly because businesses from my own community
 were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy 
 so with emotions running high and absolutely no experience in butchery some friends and i opened a meat store in the heart of the east village fashion district 
 laughter we call it honest chops  and we 're reclaiming halal by sourcing organic humanely raised animals  and by making it
  there 's really nothing like it in america the unbelievable part is actually that ninety percent of our in store customers are not even muslim 
 for many it is their first time interacting with islam on such an intimate level
