  so let me start by taking you back back into the mists of your memory
 to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life  but certainly the most anticipated year in all
  all human history the year two thousand  remember that
 the dotcom bubble  stressing about whose party you 're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight  
 before the champagne goes flat  and then there 's that inchoate yearning that was felt  i think by many 
 that the millennium that the year two thousand should mean more more than just a two and some zeroes
 our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment
 and back in two thousand agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff 
 visionary measurable long term targets called the millennium development goals 
 now i 'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow  
 or by the bedside table  but just in case you don 't  and your memory needs some jogging  the deal agreed then goes like
  this developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty hunger and deaths from disease alongside some other targets by two thousand and fifteen  
 and developed nations promised to help them
 get that done
 by dropping debts increasing smart aid and trade reform  well we 're approaching two thousand and fifteen so
  how are we doing on these goals  but we 've also got to decide do we like such global goals some people don 't  
 and if we like them we 've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward  what does the world want to do together we 've got to decide a process by which we decide 
 well i definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through  and here 's just a few reasons why  incredible
 partnerships between the private sector political leaders philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world but also
 two hundred and fifty thousand people marched in the streets of edinburgh outside this very building for make poverty history  all together they achieved these results  
 increased the number of people on
  four million lives will be saved  and combined this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year last year than in the year two thousand that 's five 
  thousand fewer kids dying every day  ten times you lot not dead every day  because of all of these partnerships 
  news is probably the subject of a different tedtalk 
 anyway for now anyone involved in getting these results  thank you  i think this proved these goals are worth it but there 's still a lot of unfinished business  
 still  seven point six million children die every year of preventable treatable diseases  
 and one hundred and seventy eight million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting a horrible term which means physical and cognitive
  lifelong impairment  so there 's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we 've got but then a lot of people think
 there are things that should have been in the original package that weren 't agreed back then that should now be included like sustainable development targets 
 natural resource governance targets  access to opportunity to knowledge
 equity  fighting corruption
  this is measurable and could be in the new goals  but the key thing here is what do you think should be in the new goals what do you want
 are you annoyed that i didn 't talk about gender equality or or education should those be in the new package of goals 
 and quite frankly that 's a good question but there 's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be
  as we gather here in edinburgh  
 technocrats appointed by the u n and certain governments with the best intentions are busying themselves designing a new package of goals  
 and currently they 're doing that through pretty much the same old 
 elite closed process 
 but of course since then the web and mobile telephony  along with ubiquitous reality tv formats have spread all around the world 
 so what we 'd like to propose is that we use them
  to involve people from all around the world in an historic first 
 the world 's first truly global poll and consultation 
 where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time  i mean wouldn 't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this given that we can 
 there 's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake
  tens of millions of lives or deaths at stake and i 'd argue  the security and future of you and your family is also at stake  
 so if you 're with me  i 'd say there 's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign collecting connecting and committing  
 so first of all we 've got to ground this campaign in core polling data let 's go into every country that will let us in
  one people what they want the new goals to be making special efforts to reach the poorest those without access to modern technology and let 's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward 
 then we 've got to
 commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward the original goals didn 't really have good baseline
  and we 're going to need the help of big data through all through all of this process to make sure we can really monitor the progress and then we 've got to connect with the big crowd  
 now here we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and upstarts  telecoms companies
  reality tv show formats
  gaming companies  telecoms all of them together in kind of their
  we are the world moment 
 could they come together and help the millennium development goals get rebranded into the millennial generation 's goals  and if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment 
 and that comment turned into a commitment we could crowdsource a force of three hundred million people around the world to help see these goals through  
  if we have this collected data  and this connected crowd  based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit i think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations  
 but the question really is through this process will we all have become committed  
 and if we are are we ready to iterate monitor and provide feedback make sure these promises are really delivering results  
 well there 's some
 fantastic examples here to scale up  mostly piloted within africa actually there 's open data kenya which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are are they delivering results often they 're not in the right place and
 ushahidi which means witness in swahili  which geocodes and crowdsources information
 in complex emergencies to help target responses 
 this is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy where citizens on the edge of a network are helping
  to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague
 stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level
 and inverts that pyramid 
 this openness this forcing openness is key  and if it wasn 't entirely transparent already  i should be open  i 've got a
  trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live 
 with population increases  consumption patterns increasing and conflict over scarce natural resources  
 and look at the state of global politics today look at the rio earth summit that happened just last week  or the mexican  g20 also last week  
  our world leaders our global politics currently can 't get it done 
 they need our help 
 they need the cavalry and the cavalry 's not going to come from mars it 's got to come from us 
 and i see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the
  to really build that constituency that 's going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century  i started
 in two thousand let me finish in two thousand and thirty  
 many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago we had called make poverty history  
 it was a naive thought in many people 's minds  and it 's true it was just a t shirt slogan that worked for the
  but look 
 the empirical condition of living under a dollar and twenty five is trending down  and look where it gets to by two thousand and thirty it 's getting near zero  
 now sure progress in china and india and poverty reduction there was key to that 
 but recently also in africa poverty rates are being reduced it will get harder as we get towards zero  
 as the poor will be increasingly located in
  fragile states or maybe in middle income states where they don 't really care about the marginalized  
 but i 'm confident with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one 
 i think we can get this and other goals done  
  was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy
 or where say a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces i mean
 it would be all over the news for a week right you just put up just as one of your numbers there that
 five thousand is that that the number
 everything that is actually on our news agenda  and it 's invisible 
 this must drive you crazy jd it does  and we 're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels for example and aid alone is not the whole solution nobody thinks it is 
 but you know 
 if people saw the results of this smart aid i mean they 'd be going crazy for it 
 i wish the two hundred and fifty thousand people who really did march outside
  this very building
 knew these results  right now they don 't  and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it because we have not 
 creatively we 've failed to communicate this success so far 
 if those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments i know for a fact we 'd get better policy 
 the mexican  g20 need not have been a bust  rio if anyone cares about the environment need not have been
  a bust  okay but these conferences are going on and i know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept but actually  the bits that are are making a difference 
 and what the politicians need is more permission from the public ca but you haven 't fully worked out the web mechanisms etc by which this might happen  i mean if the people here who 've had experience using open platforms you 're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this
  absolutely ca all right well i must say  if
 this conference led in some way to advancing that idea that 's a huge idea and if you carry that forward  that is really awesome so thank you
