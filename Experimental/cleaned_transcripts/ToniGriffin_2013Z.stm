  detroit had become the poster child for an american city in crisis  there was a housing collapse an auto industry collapse  
 and the population had plummeted by twenty five percent between two thousand
  thousand and two thousand and ten  and many people were beginning to write it off as it had topped the list of american shrinking cities 
 by two thousand and ten i had also been asked by the kresge foundation and the city of detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process
 for the city to create a shared vision for its future
 i come to this work as an architect and an urban planner  
 and i 've spent my career working in other contested cities like chicago my hometown  harlem which is my current home washington
 and newark new jersey 
 all of these cities to me still had a number of unresolved issues related to urban justice issues of equity  inclusion and access  
 now by two thousand and ten  as well  popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like detroit  and devoting whole issues to
  i was asked by a good friend fred bernstein to do an interview for the october issue of architect magazine 
 and he and i kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title can this planner save detroit 
 so i 'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now because obviously it 's completely absurd that a single person let alone a planner could save a city 
 but i 'm also smiling because i thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession
  role in helping the city to think about how it would recover from its severe crisis  
 so i 'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city a little bit about detroit  
 and i want to do that through the voices of detroiters  so we began our process in september of two thousand and ten  it 's just after a special mayoral election 
 and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide
  planning process which brings a lot of anxiety and fears among detroiters 
 we had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process  and people came out from all over the city including areas 
  that were stable neighborhoods as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy  
  city at that time 
 so obviously we have a q & a portion of our program  and people line up to mics to ask questions many of them step very firmly to the mic  put their hands across their chest and go 
 i know you people are trying to move me out of my house right 
 so that question is really powerful and it was
 certainly powerful to us in the moment
  when you connect it to the stories that some detroiters had and actually a lot of african americans ' families have had that are living in midwestern cities like detroit  
 many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great grandparents who were one of one point six million people who migrated from the rural south to the industrial north
  as depicted in this painting by jacob lawrence the great migration 
 they came to detroit for a better way of life 
 many found work in the automobile industry the ford motor company as depicted in this mural by diego rivera in the detroit institute of art 
 the fruits of their labors would afford them a home for many the first piece of property that they would ever know and a community with other 
  home buyers the first couple of decades of their life in the north is quite well
 up until about one thousand nine hundred and fifty  which coincides with the city 's peak population at one point eight million people 
 now it 's at this time that detroit begins to see a second kind of migration a migration to the suburbs  between one thousand nine hundred and fifty and two thousand the region grows by thirty percent  
  in place as families and businesses flee the city  leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs  during that same period between one thousand nine hundred and fifty 
 and two thousand two thousand and ten the city loses sixty percent of its population and today it hovers at above seven hundred thousand 
  many tell us that they 're one of only a few homes on their block that are occupied  and that they can see several
 abandoned homes from where they sit on their porches  citywide there are eighty thousand vacant homes 
 they can also see vacant property they 're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties
  and they know that because the city has lost so much population 
 their costs for water electricity  gas are rising because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need  
 citywide there are about one hundred thousand vacant parcels  now to quickly give you all a sense of a scale because i know that sounds like a big number but i don 't think
  quite understand until you look at the city map so the city is one hundred and thirty nine square miles you can fit boston san francisco  and the island of manhattan within its footprint  
 so if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together it looks like about twenty square miles and that 's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we 're sitting on today 
 manhattan at twenty two square miles so it 's a lot of vacancy  
  happening in their communities  
 and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots  and they 're starting community gardens  which are creating a great sense of community stewardship but they 're very very clear to tell us that this is not enough 
 that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them 
 now there 's been a lot of speculation
  ten about what to do with the vacant property and
 a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening or what we call urban agriculture  
 so many people would say to us what if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland it can provide fresh foods and it can put detroiters back to work too 
 when i hear that story i always imagine the folks from the great migration rolling over in their graves  
 because you can imagine that they didn 't sacrifice moving from the south to the north to create a
  better life for their families only to see their  great grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle  
 especially in a city where they came with little less than a high school education or even a grammar school education and were able to afford the basic elements of the american dream steady work and a home that they owned 
 now there 's a third wave of migration happening in detroit a new ascendant of cultural
  entrepreneurs 
 these folks see that same vacant land and those same abandoned homes as opportunity for new entrepreneurial ideas and profit  so much so that former models can move to detroit  
 buy property start successful businesses and restaurants and become successful community activists in their neighborhood bringing about very positive change  
 similarly we have small manufacturing
  companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city 
 this company shinola which is a luxury watch and bicycle company  deliberately chose to relocate to detroit and they they quote
 themselves by saying they were drawn to the global brand of detroit 's innovation  
 and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things now we have community
 stewardship happening in neighborhoods 
 we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises  and we have businesses relocating and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all 
 a city that 's under the control of an emergency manager  and just this july filed for chapter nine
  we started this process and by two thousand and thirteen we released detroit future city which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence
 not what it was but what it could be looking at new ways of economic growth 
 new forms of land use more sustainable and denser neighborhoods a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system and a heightened
  capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change  
 three key imperatives were really important to our work one was that the city itself wasn 't necessarily too large  but the economy was too small 
  there are only twenty seven jobs per one hundred people in detroit  very different from a denver or an atlanta or a philadelphia that are anywhere between
  people 
 secondly  there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come 
 it wasn 't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before 
 and urban agriculture  while a very productive and successful intervention happening in detroit  was not the only answer 
 that what we had to do is look at these areas where we
  had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population
 of what could be new productive innovative and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities  where still nearly three hundred thousand residents lived  so 
 we came up with one neighborhood typology there are several called a live make neighborhood 
  abandoned structures
 and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises with a specific emphasis on looking at the again  majority eighty two percent african american population 
 so they too could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the
 communities with which they resided 
 then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses so that it could
  be used for storm water management for example by using surface lakes and retention ponds that created neighborhood amenities places of recreation  and actually helped 
  to elevate adjacent property levels  or we could use it as research plots where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils
  or we could use it to generate energy  
 so the descendants of the great migration could either become precision watchmakers at shinola like willie h who was featured in one of their ads last year 
 or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like shinola the good news is there
  a future for the next generation of detroiters  both those there now and those that want to come 
 so no thank you mayor menino who recently was quoted as saying i 'd blow up the place and start over there are very important people 
 business and land assets in detroit and there are real opportunities there so while detroit might not be what it was detroit will not die  thank you
