  it come from what do we do about it well for most adults it 's a relatively mild disease a little fever a little headache
 joint pain  maybe a rash in fact most people who get it don 't even know they 've had it 
 but the more we find out about the zika virus the more terrifying it becomes for example doctors have noticed
 an uptick of something called guillain barr syndrome
 in recent outbreaks in
  your immune system attacks your nerve cells it can partially or even totally paralyze you fortunately that 's quite rare and most people recover  
 but if you 're pregnant
 when you 're infected
 you 're at risk of something terrible indeed a child with a deformed head 
 here 's a normal baby 
  here 's that infant with what 's called 
 a brain in a head that 's too small and there 's no known cure it was actually doctors
 in
 northeastern brazil who first noticed just a year ago 
 outbreak that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly it took medical doctors another year to be sure that it was caused by the
 but they 're now sure and if you 're a bring on the evidence type  check out this publication 
 so where did it come from and how did it get here  and it is here  like many of our viruses it came out of africa 
 specifically the zika forest
 in uganda  researchers at the nearby yellow fever research institute identified an unknown virus
 in a monkey in the the zika forest which is how it got its name the first human cases of zika fever surfaced a few years later in 
 the virus then spread through west africa and east through equatorial asia pakistan  india
  but it was still mostly in monkeys and of course mosquitoes 
 in fact in the sixty years between the time it was first identified in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven
 and two thousand and seven there were only thirteen reported cases of human zika fever  
 and then something extraordinary happened on the tiny
 micronesian yap islands there was an outbreak that
  of the population how did it get there by air 
 today we have two billion commercial airline passengers 
 an infected passenger can board a plane fly halfway around the world before developing symptoms if they develop symptoms at all 
 then when they land the local mosquitoes begin to bite them and spread the fever
  fever then next surfaced in two thousand and thirteen
 in french polynesia by december of that year it was being transmitted locally by the mosquitoes 
 that led to an explosive outbreak in which almost thirty thousand people were affected 
 from there it radiated around the pacific there were outbreaks in the cook islands in new caledonia
  in vanuatu in the solomon islands and almost all the way
 around to the coast of south america and easter island and then in early two thousand and fifteen there was
 an upsurge of cases of a dengue like syndrome
 in the city of natal in northeastern brazil the virus wasn 't dengue it was zika and it spread
  down the coast a big metropolitan center soon became the epicenter 
 well people have speculated that it was two thousand and fourteen world cup soccer fans that brought the virus into the country  
 but others have speculated that perhaps it was pacific islanders participating in championship canoe races
 that were held in rio that year that brought it in
  the virus is being locally transmitted by mosquitoes virtually throughout south america central america mexico and the caribbean islands
 until this year  the many thousands of cases that have been diagnosed in the us were contracted elsewhere  
 but as of this summer  it 's being transmitted
  so what do we do about it well preventing infection
 is either about protecting people or about eliminating the mosquitoes let 's focus on people first 
 you can get vaccinated 
 you can not travel to zika areas or you can cover up and apply
  getting vaccinated is not an option because there isn 't a vaccine yet and there probably won 't be for a couple of years staying home
 isn 't a foolproof
 protection either because we now know that it can be sexually transmitted 
 covering up and applying insect repellent does work until you forget 
 so that leaves the mosquitoes and here 's how we control them now spraying insecticides
 the protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals that
 kill people as well as bugs although it does take quite a lot more to kill a person than to kill a bug these are pictures from
 brazil and nicaragua but it looks the same in miami florida and
 we of course can spray insecticides from planes
  summer 
 mosquito control officials in dorchester county south carolina  authorized spraying of naled an insecticide early one morning as recommended by the manufacturer 
 later that day a beekeeper
 told reporters that her bee yard looked
 like it had
  bees are the good guys  the citizens of florida protested  
 but spraying continued  
 unfortunately so did the increase in the number of zika fever cases that 's because insecticides aren 't very effective 
 so are there any approaches
 that are perhaps more effective than spraying
  but
 with less downsides than toxic chemicals i 'm a huge fan of biological controls and i share that view
 with rachel carson author of silent spring the book that
 is credited with starting the environmental movement in this book she tells the story as an example of how a very nasty
 insect
 pest of livestock was
 eliminated in the last century 
 no one knows that extraordinary story today so jack block and i when we were writing an editorial about the mosquito problem today retold that story 
 and in capsule form it 's that pupae that 's the immature form of the insect were irradiated until they were sterile
 grown to adulthood and then released from planes all over the southwest the southeast and down into mexico and into central america
 literally by the hundreds of millions from little airplanes eventually eliminating that terrible insect pest
 for most of the western hemisphere
 our real purpose in writing this editorial was
  introduce readers to how we can do that today
 not with radiation but with our knowledge of genetics let me explain this is the bad guy aedes aegypti it
 's the most common insect vector of diseases not just zika but dengue chikungunya west nile virus
  it 's an urban mosquito  and it 's the female
 that does the dirty work she bites
 to get a blood meal to feed her offspring males
 don 't bite they don 't even have the mouth parts to bite a little british company called oxitec
 genetically modified that mosquito so that when it mates with a wild female its
  eggs don 't develop to adulthood let me show you 
 this is the normal reproductive cycle oxitec designed the mosquito so that when the male mates with the wild female
 the eggs don 't develop 
 sounds impossible 
 well let me show you just  diagrammatically how they do it now this represents the nucleus of a mosquito cell  and that tangle in the middle represents
 its genome the sum total of its genes scientists added a single gene that codes for a protein represented by this
 orange ball that feeds back on itself
 to keep cranking out more of that protein  the extra copies however go and gum
  killing the organism to keep it alive in the laboratory they use a compound called tetracycline tetracycline shuts off that gene
 and allows normal development they added another little wrinkle so that they could study what happens  and that is they added a gene
 that makes the insect glow under uv light
 so that when they released it they could follow exactly how far it went how long it lived
 and all of the kinds of data for a good scientific study now this is the pupal stage and at this stage
 the females are larger than the males that allows them to sort them into the males and the females
 and they allow only the males to grow
  to adulthood and let me remind you that males don 't bite from there it 's pretty simple they take beakers full
 of male mosquitoes  load them into milk cartons and drive around the city releasing them guided by gps 
 here 's the mayor of a city releasing the first batch of what they call the friendly aedes now i wish i could tell you this is an american city but it 's not
 it brought down the cases of dengue by 
  percent that 's better than any insecticide spraying can do 
 so why aren 't we using this remarkable biological control in the us  that 's because
 it 's a gmo 
  a genetically modified organism  notice the subtitle here says if the fda would let them
 they could do the same thing here when zika arrives and of course it has arrived  so now i have to tell you
 the short form of the long  torturous story of gm regulation in the us
 in the us there are three agencies that regulate genetically modified organisms
  the fda the food and drug administration the epa the environmental protection agency and the usda us department of agriculture  
 took these folks two years to decide
 that it would be the fda that would regulate the genetically modified mosquito and they would do it
 as a new animal drug if that makes any sense  
 took them another five years going
  and forth and back and forth to convince
 the fda
 that this would not harm people and it would not harm the environment they finally gave them this summer  permission to run a little
 test in the florida keys where they had been invited years earlier when they keys
  it were that easy 
 when the local residents heard that there would be genetically modified mosquitoes tested in their community some of them began to organize protests 
 they even organized a petition on the internet with this cuddly logo 
 which eventually
 accumulated some one hundred and sixty thousand signatures and they demanded a referendum
 which will be conducted in just a couple of weeks about whether the trials would be permitted at all well it 's miami that really needs
 these better ways
 of controlling insects and there the attitudes are changing in fact very recently
 a bipartisan group of more than sixty legislators wrote to hhs secretary sylvia burwell
  asking that she at the federal level expedite access for florida
 to this new technology  so the bottom line is this biological control of harmful insects
 can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly than using
  which are toxic chemicals that was true in rachel carson 's time it 's true today  what 's different
 is that we have enormously more information
 about genetics than we had then and therefore more ability to use that information
 to affect these biological controls  and i hope that what i 've done
 is aroused your curiosity enough to start your own inquiry not
  into just gm mosquitoes
 but to the other genetically modified
 organisms that are so controversial today  
 i think if you do that and you dig down through all of the misinformation and the marketing on the part of the organic food industry and the greenpeaces
 and find the science  the accurate science you 'll be surprised and pleased
