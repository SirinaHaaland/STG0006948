  how many creationists do we have in the room  probably none i think we 're all darwinians  and yet
 many darwinians are anxious a little uneasy would like to see some limits on just how far the darwinism goes
  it 's all right you know spiderwebs  sure they are products of evolution the world wide web not so sure  
 beaver dams yes hoover dam no
 what do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves
 fruits of the tree of life and hence in some sense obeying evolutionary rules  and yet people are
 interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to
 thinking to our thinking  and so i 'm going to talk a little bit about that keeping in mind that we have a lot
  on the program here  so you 're out in the woods or you 're out in the pasture and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass it
 climbs up to the top and it falls and it climbs and it falls and it climbs
 trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass  what is this ant doing 
 what is this in aid of what goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass
 what 's in it for the ant and the answer is nothing 
 there 's nothing in it for the ant 
 well then 
 why is it doing this is it just a fluke  yeah  it 's just a fluke  
 it 's a lancet fluke it 's a little brain worm it 's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach
  of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle salmon swim upstream
 to get to their spawning grounds and lancet flukes
 commandeer a passing ant crawl into its brain and drive it up a blade of grass like an all terrain vehicle
  so there 's nothing in it for the ant 
 the ant 's brain
  has been hijacked
 by a parasite that infects the brain inducing suicidal behavior  
 pretty scary
  well  does anything like that happen with human beings
  this is all on behalf of a cause other than one 's own genetic fitness of course  
 well  it may already have
  occurred to you that islam means surrender or submission of 
 to the will of allah 
 well  it 's ideas not worms that hijack our brains
  now am i saying that a sizable
 minority of the world 's population has had their brain
  hijacked by
 parasitic ideas no
 it 's worse than that most people have there
 are a lot of ideas to die for
  many people have laid down their lives for communism and many have laid down their lives for capitalism  and many for catholicism and many for islam 
 these are just a few
 of the ideas that are to die for  they 're infectious 
  and we might as well try to have a theory of what 's going on when that happens so that we
  hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others 
 i myself am a philosopher  and
 one of our occupational hazards is that
 people ask us what the meaning of life is and you have to have a bumper sticker you know you have to have a
  this is mine the
 secret of happiness is find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it
  most of us now that the me decade is well in the past now we actually do this one set of ideas or another
 have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own
  this is what our summum bonum is it 's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have
 now this is a profound biological effect  it 's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests and no other species does anything at all like it 
 well how are we going to think about this it is on the one hand a biological effect and a very large one 
 unmistakable  now  what theories do we want to use
 to look at this well many theories but how
  could something tie them together the idea of replicating ideas ideas
 that replicate by passing from brain to brain richard dawkins whom you 'll be hearing later in the day  
 invented the term memes and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book the
  's everybody 's idea now  and he 's not responsible for what i say about memes i 'm responsible
 for what i say about memes  actually i think we 're all responsible
 for not just
 the
  effects of our ideas but for their likely misuses  
 so it is important i think to richard and to me that these ideas not be
 abused and misused  they 're very easy to misuse that 's why they 're dangerous  
 and it 's just about a full time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then
 running off
 to one dire purpose or another so we have to keep
 plugging away trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful
 variants of our ideas continue to spread but it is a problem
  we don 't have much time and i 'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out because there 's a lot of other things that are going to be said so let me just
 point out memes are like viruses that 's what richard said back in ' ninety three and you might think well how can that be i mean a virus is
  viral telecommunications but what 's a virus a virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude 
 laughter that is there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does 
 and that 's what a meme is it 's an information packet with attitude  what 's a meme made of 
 what are bits made of
  of information and
 can be carried in any physical medium  what 's a word made of 
 sometimes when people say do memes exist i say well do words exist 
 are they in your ontology if they are words
 are memes that can be pronounced  then there 's all the other memes that can 't be pronounced there are different species of memes
 remember the shakers  
 gift to be simple simple  beautiful furniture and of course they 're basically extinct now
  and one of the reasons is
 that among the
  is that one should be celibate not just the priests everybody well it
 's not so surprising that
 they 've gone extinct but in fact that 's not why they went extinct  
 they survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren 't there and there were lots of
  needed a foster home  and so they had a ready supply of converts  and they could keep it going and in principle it could 've gone on forever 
 with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts 
 the idea being passed on through proselytizing  instead of through the gene line  
 so the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they 're not being passed
  on
 genetically a meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness  after all the meme for  shaker dom was essentially
 a sterilizing
 parasite there are other parasites that do this which render the host
 sterile  it 's part of their plan
 they don 't have to have minds to have a plan  i 'm just going to
 draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective
  which i recommend i 've not time to go into
  jared diamond 's wonderful book guns germs and steel 
 he talks about how it was germs more than guns and steel that conquered
 the new hemisphere the western hemisphere that conquered the rest of the world when european
 explorers and travelers
 spread out they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to that they had
  learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years thousands of years of
 living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens  
 and they just wiped out these pathogens just wiped out the native people who had no immunity to them at all
 and we 're doing it again  we 're doing it this time with toxic
  ideas  yesterday  a number of people nicholas negroponte and others spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas
 get spread out thanks to all the new technology all over the world and i agree it is largely
 wonderful largely wonderful but
 among all those ideas that inevitably
  flow out into the whole world
 thanks to our technology are a lot of toxic ideas  now this has been realized for some time sayyid qutb is
 one of the founding fathers of
 fanatical islam one of the ideologues that inspired
  one has only to glance at its press films fashion shows beauty contests ballrooms wine bars and broadcasting stations 
 memes these memes are spreading around the world
 and they are
 wiping out whole cultures  they are wiping out languages  they are wiping out traditions
 and practices  and it 's not our fault
 anymore than it 's our fault when our germs
 lay waste to people that haven 't developed the immunity we have
 an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture we 're a free society  so we let pornography and all these things
  like a mild cold  they 're not a big deal for us but we should recognize
 that for many people in the world they are a big deal  
 and we should be very alert to this as we spread our education and our technology 
 one of the things that we are doing
 is
 we 're the vectors of memes that are correctly
  viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes the memes that they are prepared to die for 
 well now how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes that is not the job
 of the science of memetics memetics is morally neutral 
  and so it should be 
 this is not the place for hate and anger  if you 've had a friend who 's died of aids then
 you you hate hiv but the way to deal with that is to do science  and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral
 perspective
