  settling in for the day at work and this guy that you sort of recognize from down the hall  walks right into your cubicle and he steals your chair doesn 't
  say a word just rolls away with it 
 doesn 't give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that are out there doesn 't acknowledge the fact that you might need your chair to get some work done today  
 you wouldn 't stand for it you 'd make a stink you 'd follow that guy back to his cubicle and you 'd say why my chair 
 okay  so now it 's tuesday morning and you 're at the office  
 and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar
  and it 's from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall  and the subject line references some project that you heard a little bit about but there 's no agenda there
 's no information about why you were invited to the meeting  and yet you accept the meeting invitation and you go  
 and when this highly unproductive session is over 
 you go back to your desk and you stand at your desk and you say boy i wish i had those two hours back like i wish i had my chair back
  every day we allow our coworkers who are otherwise very very nice people to steal from us
  and i 'm talking about something far more valuable than office furniture i 'm talking about time your time 
 in fact  i believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new
  the primary symptom of mindless accept syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar 
 it 's an involuntary reflex ding click  bing it 's in your calendar gotta go i 'm already late for a meeting 
 meetings are important right and collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise and a well run meeting can yield really
  positive actionable results  but between globalization and pervasive information technology 
 the way that we work has really changed dramatically over the last few years  
 and we 're miserable 
 laughter and we 're miserable not because the other guy can 't run a good meeting  it 's because of mas our mindless accept syndrome
  have evidence to prove that mas is a global epidemic let
 me tell you why a couple of years ago i put a video on youtube  and in the video i acted out every terrible conference call you 've ever been on it
 goes on for about five minutes and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings 
 there 's the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting there are the participants who have no idea why they 're
  of collapses into this collaborative train wreck and everybody leaves very angry it 's kind of funny
  our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal
  couple of weeks after i put that online five hundred thousand people in dozens of countries  i mean dozens of countries  
 watched this video  and three years later it 's still getting thousands of views every month it
 's close to about a million right now and
 in fact some of the biggest companies in the world companies that you 've heard of but i won 't name have
  asked for my permission to use this video in their  new hire training
 to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company
  and if the numbers there are a million views and it 's being used by all these companies aren 't enough proof that we have a global problem with meetings 
 there are the many many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up 
 thousands of people wrote things like omg that was my day today
  day every day this is my life 
 one guy wrote it 's funny because it 's true  eerily sadly depressingly true it made me laugh until i cried  and cried  and i cried some more 
 this poor guy said my daily life until retirement or death sigh 
  are real quotes and it 's real sad a common theme running through all of these comments online
 is this fundamental belief that we are powerless to do anything other than go to meetings and suffer through these poorly run meetings and live to meet another day 
 but the truth is we 're not powerless at all in
 fact the cure for mas is right here in our hands it 's right at our fingertips literally  it 's something that i call no
  if i remember my high school spanish means something like enough already make it stop
