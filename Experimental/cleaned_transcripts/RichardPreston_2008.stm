  rainforests temperate rainforests where it can rain more than one hundred inches a year  this is the realm of the coast redwood tree
  its species name is sequoia sempervirens sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on earth 
 the range of the species goes up to as much as three hundred and eighty feet tall that 's thirty eight stories tall these are trees that would stand out in midtown manhattan 
 nobody knows how old the oldest living coast redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any
  them to count their annual growth rings and in any case  the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow  but it 's believed that the oldest living redwoods are 
 perhaps two thousand five hundred years old roughly the age of the parthenon
  the north coast of california where the rain is really intense 
 in recent historic times about ninety six percent of the coast redwood forest was cut down especially in a series 
  of bursts of intense liquidation logging clear cutting that took place in the
 about four percent of the primeval redwood rainforest remains intact  wild and now protected
 entirely protected in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of california  including redwood national park  
 but curiously 
  the fragments that we have left to this day remain
 redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through
  and even today individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before including in the summer of two thousand and six hyperion  the world 's tallest tree  
 i 'm going to do a little gedanken experiment  i 'm going to ask you to imagine what a redwood really is as a living organism and chris if i could have you up
  here  i have a tape measure
  it 's a kind loaner from ted  
 and chris if you could take the end of that tape measure we
 're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big redwood is unfortunately 
 this tape isn 't long enough it 's only
  tape  chris could you extend your arm out that way there we go ok  and
 maybe about here about thirty feet is the diameter of a big redwood 
 now  let your imagination go upward into space think about this tree  
  an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time  
 the redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time not human time  but what we might call redwood time  
 redwood time
 moves at a more stately pace than human time
  to us when we look at a redwood tree  it seems to be motionless and still  and yet redwoods are constantly in motion 
 moving upward into space  
 articulating themselves and filling redwood space over redwood time  over thousands of years plant this small seed  wait two thousand years and you get this the lost monarch it dwells in the grove of
  titans on the north coast and was discovered in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and yet when you look at the base of a redwood tree  you 're not seeing the organism you
 're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant and most of the organism is overhead unseen 
 i became very interested and i wrote about
 a couple steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy
  also are world class forest ecology scientists 
 steve sillett when he was a 19 year old college student at reed college 
 had heard that the redwood forest canopy is considered to be a so called redwood desert that is to say at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of redwood trees
  and with a friend of his he took it upon himself to free climb a redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there he climbed up a small tree next to this giant redwood and then
 he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands and ended up hanging like catching a bar of a trapeze  and then from there he climbed directly up the bark
 until he got to the top of the tree  his friend a guy named marwood
  neither one of them had noticed that there was a yellow jacket wasp 's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that steve had jumped into and when marwood made the jump he was covered with wasps
 stinging him in the face and eyes he nearly let go 
 he would have fallen to his death being seventy five feet above the ground  but they made it to the top  and what they found was not a redwood desert but a lost world a kind of three dimensional labyrinth in the air filled
  with unknown life now i had been working on other topics the emergence of infectious diseases 
 which come out of the natural ecosystems of the earth  make a trans species jump  and get into humans  
 after three books on this it got to be a bit much in a way 
 my wife and i adore our
  i began climbing trees with my kids as
 as just something to do with them using the so called arborist climbing technique with ropes you use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree  children are incredibly adept at climbing trees that 's my son oliver 
 they don 't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do 
  if ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest 
 humans appear to be the only primates that i know of
 that
 are afraid of heights all other primates when they 're scared they run up a tree where they feel safe 
 we camped overnight in the trees in tree boats this is my daughter laura then fifteen looking out of a tree boat she 's by the way tied in with a rope
 so she can 't fall 
 looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us we had been visited in the night by flying squirrels who don 't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they 've never seen them in the canopy before  
 and we practiced advanced techniques like sky walking where you can move from
  tree to tree through space rather like spiderman  
 it became a writing project  when steve sillett gets up into a big redwood he fires an arrow  which trails a fishing line  which gets over a branch in the tree and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line 
 you ascend thirty stories there are two people climbing this tree  gaya  which is thought to be one of the oldest redwoods there they are they are
  of the way up that tree  
 you do feel a sense of exposure there is a small person right down there on the ground you feel like you 're climbing a wall of wood  but then you enter the redwood canopy and 
 it 's like coming through a layer of clouds and all of a sudden you lose sight of the ground and you also lose sight of the sky  and you 're in a three dimensional labyrinth in the air 
 filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil which is populated with all kinds of small organisms
 there are epiphytes  plants that grow on trees  these are huckleberry bushes many species of mosses  and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree  
 when you get near the top of the tree  
 you feel like you can 't fall in fact it 's difficult to move you 're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don 't occur near the ground  it 's like scuba diving into a coral reef
  you 're going upward instead of downward  and then the trees tend to flare out into platform like areas at the top maria 's sitting on one of them these limbs could be five to six hundred years old redwoods grow very slowly in their tops 
 they also have a feature thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry
  and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you 're resting 
 redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration 
 a redwood is a fractal  and as they put out limbs 
 the limbs burst into small trees copies of the redwood 
 now here we see a reiteration in
  one of the older redwoods this reiteration is a huge flying buttress that comes out the tree itself
  this buttress is less than halfway up the tree
 and then it bursts into a forest of redwoods this particular extra trunk
 is a meter across at the base and extends upward for one hundred and fifty feet  it 's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the mississippi river  and yet it 's only
  of the crown structure of a redwood named iluvatar  made by steve sillett  marie antoine and their colleagues gives you an idea what you 're seeing here is a hierarchical 
 schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks  
  to give a sense of scale 
 there 's the person right there the person is waving to us i 've wanted to ask craig venter
 if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to and if we were able to reiterate then the fingers of our hand would be people
  who looked like us  
 and they would have people on their hands and so on and if we had redwood like biology we would have six layers of people on our hands as it were and it would be a lovely thing to 
  be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time 
 laughter to reiterate the point
  let 's go closer into iluvatar  
 we 're looking at that yellow box  and this hallucinatory drawing shows you everything you see in this drawing is iluvatar 
 these are millennial structures portions of the tree that are believed to be more than one thousand years old there are four humans in this shot one two 
  and there 's also something that i want to show you this is a flying buttress 
 redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk going back into the main trunk and fusing with it 
  flying buttresses just as in a cathedral help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time  
  wired them like patients in 
 they 're finding out that redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks possibly all the way into their root systems they also have the ability to put roots anywhere 
  in the tree itself if a portion of a redwood is rotting the redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart
  got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just you know extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off 
 canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep 
 hundreds of feet above the ground  and there are organisms in this soil that have as yet no names this is an unnamed species of
  a copepod is a crustacean these copepods are a major constituent
 of the oceans  and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales what they 're doing in in the redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean  or how they got there 
 is completely unknown 
 there are some interesting theories that if i had time i would tell you about but as you go and you look closer at a tree what you see is you see increasing complexity
  're looking at the very top of gaya 
 which is thought to be the oldest redwood gaya may be three thousand to five thousand years old  no one really knows  but its top has broken off and it 's been rotting back now  this little japanese garden like
 creation
 probably took seven hundred years to form in its complexity that we see right now  as you look at a tree
  it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree  
 i have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk  
 the eastern hemlock tree has often been described as the redwood of the east  and we 're moving in a full circle now in the 
 a small organism appeared in richmond  virginia  
 called the hemlock woolly adelgid it made a trans species jump out of some other organism in asia  where it was living on hemlock trees in asia  when it moved into 
  its new host the eastern hemlock tree  it escaped its predators  and the new tree had no resistance to it the eastern hemlock forest is being considered in some 
  ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the mississippi river  i hadn 't even known that there were rainforests in the east but in great smoky
  mountains national park
 it can rain up to one hundred inches of rain a year
  and in the last two to three summers
  these invasive organisms this kind of ebola of the trees as it were has swept through the primeval hemlock forest of
  and has absolutely wiped it out 
 i climbed there this past summer  this is great smoky mountains national park and the hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see  
 and what we 're seeing is not just the potential death of the eastern hemlock species that is to say its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite but we 're also seeing the death
  for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial
 labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns it 's absolutely heartbreaking to see one of the things that is just
 i almost can 't conceive it is the idea that the national news media hasn 't picked this up at all and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in north america
  what can the redwoods tell us about ourselves well i think they can tell us something about human time  the flickering 
 transitory quality of human time
 and the brevity of human life the necessity to love  
 but we 're different from trees and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have we are human and we have the capacity to
  love we have the capacity to wonder and we have a sort of boundless curiosity 
 a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates i think 
 and at least for me personally  the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children  
 exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth
  and i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that
 that with my children i 've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who
 are lucky enough or possibly stupid enough to still climb trees  thank you very much
  it was nathan myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like two thousand years and older on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the earth except on that one
  i mentioned hyperion the world 's tallest tree 
 and i was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it in two thousand and six and while we were climbing hyperion  marie antoine
 spotted an unknown species of  golden brown ant about halfway up the trunk  
 ants are not known to occur in redwood trees curiously enough  
 and we wondered whether this ant this species of ant was only endemic to that one tree
  possibly to that grove  and in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again and so no specimens have ever been collected we don 't know what it is we just know it 's there ca 
 so you have to wonder when you know  if some other
 species than us was recording the stories that mattered on earth you know 
  our stories are about iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip you 've just told us a different story of this this tragic arms race that 's happening and maybe whole
 ecosystems gone forever it
 's an amazing sense of wonder you 've given me  and a sense of just how fragile this this whole thing is rp it is fragile and you know i think about emerging human diseases
 parasites that move into the human species but that 's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species
  worldwide all through the ecosystems and you know the earth itself ca partly caused by us  inadvertently rp caused by humans caused by the movement of humans 
 you can think of the earth 's biosphere as a palace  and the continents are rooms in the palace and the islands are small rooms
  but lately  
 the doors of the palace have been flung open and the walls are coming down ca 
 richard preston thank you very much i think
