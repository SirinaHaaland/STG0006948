  i was born with bilateral retinoblastoma  retinal
  right eye was removed
 at seven months of age  i was thirteen months when they removed my left eye the first thing i did
 upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care
  wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes the problem
 was getting caught  it 's impressions about blindness
 that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself
 think for a moment about your own impressions
 of blindness think about your reactions when i first came onto the stage  
 or the prospect of your own blindness or a loved one going blind 
 the terror is incomprehensible
 to most of us because blindness
 is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness hapless exposure
 to the ravages of the dark unknown  how poetic
  fortunately for me my parents were not poetic they were
  they understood
 that ignorance and fear
 were but matters of the mind and the mind is adaptable they
 believed that i should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities
 as everyone else in their own words i would move out
 which i did when i was eighteen
 i will pay taxes
 thanks
 and they knew the difference between love and fear fear immobilizes 
  us in the face of challenge  they knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge  i was not raised with fear  
 now  moving forward  how do i manage today 
 the world is a much larger nursery  
 fortunately i have my trusty long cane  
 longer than the canes used by most blind people i call it my freedom staff 
 it will keep me
  undignified departure from the stage i do see that cliff edge  
 they warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage  i don 't care to set a new precedent
  but beyond that many of you may have heard me clicking as i came
  those are flashes of sound
 that go out
 and reflect from surfaces all around me  just like a bat 's sonar  and return to me with patterns with pieces of information  
 much as light does for you and my brain  thanks to my parents
  to form images in my visual cortex which we now call the imaging system from those patterns of information much as your brain does  
 i call this process flash sonar
  it is how i have learned to see through my blindness to navigate my journey
 through the dark unknowns of my own challenges
  which has earned me the moniker the remarkable batman now batman
 i will accept  bats are cool  
 batman is cool  but i was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable
  i have always regarded myself much like anyone else who
  navigates
 the dark unknowns of their own challenges is that so
 remarkable  i do not use my eyes  i use my brain  
 now  someone  somewhere  must think that 's remarkable or i wouldn 't be up here but
 let 's consider this for a moment
  who faces or who has ever faced a challenge  raise your hands 
 whoosh okay  lots of hands going up a moment let me do a head count 
 this will take a while okay 
 lots of hands in the air keep
  have an idea those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges  put your hands down  
 okay anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own 
 so we all face challenges and we all face the
  which is endemic to most challenges which is what what most of us fear  okay  but we all have brains
 that allow us that activate to allow us to navigate
 the journey through these challenges
  wouldn 't
 tell me
 where the lectern was so you can 't trust those ted folks 
 find it yourself they said so 
 and the feedback for the p a system is no help at all so
  now i present to you a challenge  so if you 'd all close your eyes for just a moment okay and
 you 're going to learn a bit of flash sonar  i 'm going to make a sound 
 i 'm going to hold this panel in front of me but i 'm not going to move it just listen to the sound for a moment
  nothing very interesting now  listen to what happens to that same exact sound when i move the panel 
 you do not know the power of the dark side
  now keep your eyes closed
 because did you hear the difference  okay  now  let 's be sure for your challenge  
 you tell me  just say now when you hear
 the panel start to move okay we 'll relax into this
  open your eyes all right so
 just a few centimeters you would notice the difference you 've experienced sonar 
 you 'd all make great blind people 
 let 's have a look at what can happen
 when this activation
  see with your eyes and we can see with our ears brian bushway it 's not a matter of enjoying it more or less
  wouldn 't go back to being sighted jr the bigger the goal the more obstacles you 'll face and on the other side of that goal is victory
  these people look terrified not so much we have
 delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly forty countries when
  blind people learn to see sighted people seem inspired
 to want to learn to see their way better more clearly with less fear 
 because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all
 to navigate any type of challenge through any form
 of darkness to discoveries unimagined
 when we are activated i wish you all
 a most activating journey
  spectacular standing ovation at ted thank you for an extraordinary talk
  just one more question about your world your inner world that you construct we think
 that we have things in our world
  you as a blind person don 't have but what 's your world like what do you have that we don 't have 
 dk three hundred and sixty degree view
 so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me  it works around corners  it works through surfaces 
 generally it 's kind of a fuzzy  three dimensional geometry one of
 an instructor when he lost his vision  
 after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house conversations 
 people in the kitchen people in the bathroom  several floors away several walls away he said it was something like having  x ray vision ca 
 what do you picture that you 're
  a sound when they laugh when they fidget  when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever  i hear everything i hear every little movement that every single person makes none of it really escapes my attention  
  from a sonar perspective the size of the room the
 curvature of the audience around the stage  it 's the height
 of the room 
 like i say it 's all that kind of three dimensional surface geometry all around me ca well daniel you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way
