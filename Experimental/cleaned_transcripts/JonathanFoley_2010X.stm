  have a conversation about this incredible global issue that 's at the intersection of land use food and environment something
 we can all relate to and what i 've been calling the other inconvenient truth but first i want to take you on a little journey
 let 's first visit our planet but at night and from space
 this is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet
 and the thing you would notice first of course is how dominant the human presence on our planet is
 we see cities we see oil fields you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea
 that we are dominating much of our planet and mostly through the use of energy that we see here at night
 but let 's go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime
 what we see during the day is our landscapes
 this is part of the amazon basin a place called rondonia in the south center part of the brazilian amazon
 if you look really carefully in the upper right hand corner you 're going to see
  a thin white line which is a road that was built in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s
 if we come back to the same place in two thousand and one
 what we 're going to find is that these roads spurt off more roads and more roads after that at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest where there are going to be a few cows
 these cows are used for beef we 're going to eat these cows and these cows are eaten
  basically in south america in brazil and argentina they 're not being shipped up here
 but this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation is something we notice a lot of around the tropics especially in this part of the world
 if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world we can go to the bolivian edge of the amazon here also in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five
 and if you look really carefully there 's a thin white line through that kind of seam
  and there 's a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle let 's come back again a few years later here in two thousand and three
 and we 'll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like iowa than it does like a rainforest in fact what you 're seeing here are soybean fields
 these soybeans are being shipped to europe and
  to china as animal feed especially after the mad cow disease scare about a decade ago where we don 't want to feed animals animal protein anymore because that can transmit disease
  instead we want to feed them more vegetable proteins so soybeans have really exploded showing how trade and globalization are
  world is that landscape after landscape after landscape have been cleared and altered for growing food and other crops
 so one of the questions we 've been asking is how much of the world is used to grow food and where is it exactly and how can we change that into the future and what does it mean
 well our team has been looking at this on a global scale using satellite data and ground based data kind of to track
  farming on a global scale
 and this is what we found and it 's startling this map shows the presence of agriculture on planet earth
 the green areas are the areas we use to grow crops like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever
 that 's sixteen million square kilometers worth of land if you put it all together in one place it 'd be the size of south america
 the second area in brown is the world 's pastures and rangelands where our animals live
 that area 's about thirty million square kilometers or about an africa 's worth of land
 a huge amount of land and it 's the best land of course is what you see and what 's left is like the middle of the sahara desert or siberia or the middle of a rain forest
 we 're using a planet 's worth of land already
 if we look at this carefully we find
  about forty percent of the earth 's land surface is devoted to agriculture
 and it 's sixty times larger than all the areas we complain about our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live half of humanity lives in cities today
 but a sixty times larger area is used to grow food
 so this is an amazing kind of result and it really shocked us when we looked at that so we 're using an enormous amount of land for
  agriculture but also we 're using a lot of water
 this is a photograph flying into arizona and when you look at it you 're like what are they growing here it turns out they 're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert
 using water sprayed on top
 now the irony is it 's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the twin cities
 but what 's really interesting is this water 's got to come from some place and it comes from here the colorado river in north america
  well the colorado on a typical day in the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s this is just you know not a flood not a drought kind of an average day it looks something like this
 but if we come back today during a normal condition to the exact same location this is what 's left
 the difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food or maybe golf courses in scottsdale you take your pick
 well this is a lot of water and again we 're mining water and using it to grow food
 and today if you travel down further down the colorado it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean we 've literally consumed an entire river in north america for irrigation
 well that 's not even the worst example in the world this probably is the aral sea
 now a lot you will remember this from your geography classes this is in the former soviet union in between kazakhstan and uzbekistan one of the great
  seas of the world
 but there 's kind of a paradox here because it looks like it 's surrounded by desert why is this sea here
 the reason it 's here is because on the right hand side you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand feeding this basin with water
 those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east where snow melts it travels down the river through the desert and forms the great aral sea
  fifty s the soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton believe it or not in kazakhstan to sell cotton to the international markets to bring foreign currency into the soviet union they really needed the money
 well you can imagine what happens you turn off the water supply to the aral sea what 's going to happen here it
 two thousand and four and about eleven months ago it 's
 pretty extraordinary
 now a lot of us in the audience here live in the midwest imagine that was lake superior
 imagine that was lake huron it 's an extraordinary change this is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is this is a change
  in the fundamentals of the environment of this region
 let 's start with this the soviet union didn 't really have a sierra club let 's put it that way
 so what you find in the bottom of the aral sea ain 't pretty there 's a lot of toxic waste a lot of things that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne
 one of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of soviet
 biological weapons testing you can walk there today
 weather patterns have changed nineteen of the unique twenty fish species found only in the aral sea are now wiped off the face of the earth
 this is an environmental disaster writ large
 but let 's bring it home
 this is a picture that al gore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the soviet union a long long time ago showing the fishing fleets of the aral sea
  you see the canal they dug they were so desperate to try to kind of float the boats into the remaining pools of water but they finally had to give up because the piers and the moorings simply couldn 't keep up with the retreating shoreline
 i don 't know about you but i 'm terrified that future archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about our time in history and wonder what were you thinking
 well that 's the future we have to look forward to
 we already use about fifty percent of the earth 's fresh water that 's sustainable and agriculture alone is seventy percent of that
 so we use a lot of
  water a lot of land for agriculture we also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture
 usually when we think about the atmosphere we think about climate change and greenhouse gases and mostly around energy
 but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases too if you look at carbon dioxide from
 burning tropical rainforest or methane coming from cows and rice or nitrous oxide from
  too many fertilizers it turns out agriculture is thirty percent of the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere from human activity
 that 's more than all our transportation it 's more than all our electricity it 's more than all other manufacturing in fact
 it 's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world
 and yet we don 't talk about it very much
 so we have this incredible presence today of agriculture
  dominating our planet whether it 's forty percent of our land surface seventy percent of the water we use thirty percent of our greenhouse gas emissions
 we 've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers causing huge problems of water quality from rivers lakes and even oceans
 and it 's also the single biggest
 driver of biodiversity loss
 so without a doubt agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age
 no question and it rivals climate change in importance and they 're both happening at the same time
 but what 's really important here to remember is that it 's not all bad it 's not that agriculture 's a bad thing in fact we completely depend on it it
 's not optional it 's not a luxury it 's an absolute necessity
 we have to provide
  food and feed and yeah fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people in the world today
 and if anything we 're going to have the demands on agriculture increase into the future it 's not going to go away it 's going to get a lot bigger mainly because of growing population
  we 're seven billion people today heading towards at least nine probably nine and a half before we 're done
 as the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous we 're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does
 so more people eating more stuff and richer stuff
 and of course having an energy crisis at the same time where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio energy sources
  so you put these together it 's really hard to see how we 're going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production
 well how are we going to do this how are going to double global ag production around the world
 well we could try to farm more land this is an analysis we 've done where on the left is where the crops are today
 on the right is where they could be based on soils and climate
  assuming climate change doesn 't disrupt too much of this which is not a good assumption
 we could farm more land but the problem is the remaining lands are in sensitive areas they have a lot of biodiversity a lot of carbon things we want to protect
 so we could grow more food by expanding farmland but we 'd better not because it 's ecologically a very very dangerous thing to do
 instead we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture
  and farm the lands we have better
 this is work that we 're doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment
 the green areas here show where corn yields just showing corn as an example are already really high probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil
  but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we 're only getting maybe twenty or thirty percent of the yield you should be able to get
 you see a lot of this in africa even latin america but interestingly eastern europe where soviet union and eastern bloc countries used to be is still a mess agriculturally
 now this would require nutrients and water it 's going to either be organic or conventional or some mix of the two to deliver that plants need water and nutrients
 but we can do this and there are opportunities to make this work
 but we have to do it in a way that
  sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future
 we have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better
 right now it 's kind of an all or nothing proposition we can grow food in the background that 's a soybean field and in this flower
 flower diagram it shows we grow a lot of food but we don 't have a lot clean water we 're not storing a lot of carbon we don 't have a lot of biodiversity
 in the foreground we have this prairie that 's wonderful from the environmental side but you can 't eat anything what 's there to eat
 we need to figure out how to bring both of those together into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together
 now when i talk about this people often tell me well isn 't blank the answer organic food local food gmos new trade
  subsidies new farm bills
 and yeah we we have a lot of good ideas here but not any one of these is a silver bullet
 in fact what i think they are is more like silver buckshot
 and i love silver buckshot you put it together and you 've got something really powerful but we need to put them together
 so what we have to do i think is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution
 with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation conservation
 not to have them fighting each other but to have them collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture something i call terraculture
 or farming for a whole planet
 now having this conversation has been really hard and we 've been trying very hard to bring these key points to people to reduce the controversy
  to increase the collaboration i want to show you a short video that does kind of show our efforts right now to bring these sides together into a single conversation so let me show you that
 the
  so we face one of the greatest grand challenges in all of human history today
 the need to feed nine billion people and do so sustainably and equitably and justly
 at the same time protecting our planet for this and future generations
 this is going to be one of the hardest things we ever have done in human history and we absolutely have to get it right
 and we have to get it right on our first and only try
 so thanks very much
