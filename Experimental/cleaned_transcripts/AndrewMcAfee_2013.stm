  the writer george eliot cautioned us that among all forms of mistake prophesy is the most gratuitous  the person that we would all acknowledge as
 i 'm going to ignore their cautions and make one very specific forecast in the world that we are creating very quickly 
 we 're going to see more and more things that look like science fiction and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs  our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves  which means we 're going to need fewer truck drivers we
 're going to hook siri up to watson and use that to automate a lot of the work that 's currently done by customer
  service reps and troubleshooters and diagnosers  and we 're already taking 
 painting him orange  and putting him to work carrying shelves around warehouses  which means we need a lot fewer people to be walking up and down those aisles 
 now for about two hundred years people have been saying exactly what i 'm telling you the age of technological unemployment is at hand
  starting with the luddites smashing looms in britain just about two centuries ago  and they have been wrong our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment which brings up a critical question  
 why is this time different if it really is 
 the reason it 's different is that just in the past few years our machines have started
  they 're still acquiring new skills for example  mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive 
 but the research arm of the defense department just launched a competition to have them do things like this and if the track record is any guide this competition is going to be successful 
 so when i look around i think the day is not too far off at all when we 're going to have
 androids doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now  
 and we 're creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs it 's a world that erik brynjolfsson and i are calling the new 
  machine age the thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news this is the best economic news on the planet these days 
 this is the best economic news we have these days for two main reasons  the first is technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we 're on
 where output goes up over time  while at the same time prices go down and volume and quality just
 continue to explode now some people look at this and talk about shallow materialism  but that 's absolutely the wrong way to look at it this is abundance  which is exactly what we want our economic system to provide  
 the second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that once the androids start doing jobs  we don 't have to do them anymore  and we get freed up from drudgery
  when i talk about this with my friends in cambridge and silicon valley they say fantastic no more drudgery no more toil this gives us the chance to imagine an entirely different kind of society 
 a society where the creators and the discoverers and the performers and the innovators
  and there 's actually a huge amount of truth here we are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place in a world where it is just about as easy to generate an object as it is to print a document 
 we have amazing new possibilities the people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists are now makers and they 're responsible for massive amounts of
  artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never  ever possible for them before  
 so this is a time of great flourishing and the more i look around the more convinced i become that this quote from the physicist freeman dyson is not hyperbole at all 
 this is just a plain statement of the facts we are in the middle of an astonishing period
 great hang up flourish go home  we 're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges as we head deeper into the future that we 're creating the first are economic 
  and they 're really nicely summarized in an apocryphal story about a  back and forth between henry ford ii and walter reuther who was the head of the auto workers
  they were touring one of the new modern factories and ford playfully turns to reuther and says hey walter 
 how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues and reuther shoots back hey henry how are you going to get them to buy cars 
 reuther 's problem in that anecdote is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy that 's full of machines  and we see this very clearly in the statistics if you look over the past couple decades at the returns
  to capital in other words corporate profits we see them going up and we see that they 're now at an all time high  if we look at the returns to labor in other words total wages 
  paid out in the economy we see them at an all time low and heading very quickly in the opposite direction  
  volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people 
 you really want a large  stable  prosperous middle class we have had one of those in america for just about the entire postwar period  
 but the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now  we all know a lot of the statistics but just to repeat one of them median income in america has actually gone down over the past fifteen years  and we 're in danger
  getting trapped in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization continue to go up over time  
 the societal challenges that come along with that kind of inequality deserve some attention there are a set of societal challenges that i 'm actually not that worried about  and they 're captured by images like this this is not the kind of societal
  that i am concerned about there is no shortage of dystopian visions about what happens when our machines become 
 and they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us i 'm going to start worrying about those the day my computer becomes aware of my printer 
 so this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about to tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age i want to tell a story about two
  stereotypical american workers and to make them really stereotypical  let 's make them both white guys and the first one is a 
 professional creative type manager  engineer doctor lawyer that kind of worker we 're going to call him ted he
 's at the top of the american middle class
  works as a laborer  works as a clerk does low level white collar or blue collar work in the economy we 're going to call that guy bill 
 and if you go back about fifty years  bill and ted were leading remarkably similar lives for example in one thousand nine hundred and sixty they were both very likely to have full time jobs working at least forty hours a week  
 but as the social researcher charles murray has documented as we started to automate the economy
 one thousand nine hundred and sixty is just about when computers started to be used by businesses as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy  
 the fortunes of bill and ted diverged a lot over this time frame ted has continued to hold a full time job bill hasn 't 
 in many cases bill has left the economy entirely  and ted very rarely has over time
  ted 's marriage has stayed quite happy bill 's hasn 't 
 and ted 's kids have grown up in a two parent home  while bill 's absolutely have not over time 
 other ways that bill is dropping out of society he 's decreased his voting in presidential elections  
 and he 's started to go to prison a lot more often
  i cannot tell a happy story about these social trends  and they don 't show any signs of reversing themselves  they 're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic 
  group we look at  and they 're actually getting so severe that they 're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the civil rights movement  
  lives  and they 've got all the benefits to show from that while bill is leading a very different life they 're actually both proof of how right voltaire was when he talked about the benefits of work and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils [ work saves a man from three great evils boredom vice and need voltaire ]
 so with these challenges what do we do about them the economic playbook is surprisingly
 surprisingly clear surprisingly straightforward in the short term especially the robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two so the classic econ one hundred and one playbook is going to work just fine  
 encourage entrepreneurship  
 double down on infrastructure and make sure we 're turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills  
 but over the longer term if we are moving into an economy that 's heavy on technology and light on labor  and we are then we have to consider some more radical
  interventions for example something like a guaranteed minimum income 
 now that 's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable  because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth 
 i did a little bit of research on this notion and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those
  friedrich hayek  richard nixon and milton friedman  and if you find yourself worried that
 something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent you might be interested to know that social mobility one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the united
  is now lower than it is in the northern european countries that have these very generous social safety nets  so the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward  the societal one 
 is a lot more challenging  i don 't know what the playbook is for getting bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life i do know that education is a huge part 
  of it i witnessed this firsthand  i was a montessori kid for the first few years of my education and what that education taught me is that the world is an interesting place
 and my job is to go explore it  
 the school stopped in third grade so then i entered the public school system  and it felt like i had been sent to the gulag 
 with the benefit of of hindsight i now know the job was to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer  but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of bore me into some submission with what was going on around me we have to do better than this we cannot
  keep turning out bills
 so we see some green shoots that things are getting better we see technology deeply impacting education and engaging people from our youngest learners up to our oldest ones 
 we see very prominent business voices telling us we need to rethink some of the things that we 've been holding dear for a while  and we see very serious and
  to understand how to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have so the green shoots are out there i don
 't want to pretend for a minute that what we have is going to be enough we 're facing very tough challenges to give just one example there are about five million americans who have been unemployed for at least six months we
 're not going to fix things for them by sending them back to montessori 
 and my biggest worry is that we 're creating a world where we 're going to have glittering technologies embedded in kind of a
  shabby society and supported by an economy that generates inequality instead of opportunity  but i actually don 't think that 's what we 're going to do i think we 're going to do something a lot better 
 for one very straightforward reason the facts are getting out there the realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known  if we wanted to accelerate that process we could do things like have our best economists and policymakers
 play jeopardy against watson  
 we could send congress on an autonomous car road trip  and if we do enough of these kinds of things the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different 
 and then we 're off to the races because i don 't believe for a second
 that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too
  to even try  
 i started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths who were separated by an ocean and a century  let me end it with words from politicians who were similarly distant 
 winston churchill came to my home of mit in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine and he said if we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance it 
  can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production 
  i am a firm believer in the people 
 if given the truth they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis the great point is to give them the plain facts so the optimistic note great point that i want to leave 
  you with is that the plain facts of the machine age are becoming clear  and i have every confidence that we 're going to use them to chart a good course into the challenging  abundant economy that we 're creating
