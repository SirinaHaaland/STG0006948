  two american friends are traveling together in italy  they go to see michelangelo 's david and when they finally come face to face with the statue they both freeze dead in their tracks
 the first guy we 'll call him adam
 is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form the second guy we 'll call him bill is transfixed
  by embarrassment at staring at the thing there in the in the center  
 so here 's my question for you which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for george bush  which for al gore
  i don 't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes we all know that it 's bill and in this case the stereotype
 corresponds to reality it really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience 
 people who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty variety diversity new ideas travel 
 people low on it like things that are familiar that are safe and dependable
  if you know about this trait you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior you can understand why artists are so
  you can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read what kinds of places they like to travel to and what kinds of food they like to eat once you understand this trait  you can understand why anybody would eat at applebee 's but not anybody that you know 
 this trait also tells us a lot about politics the main researcher of this trait robert mccrae says that open individuals have an affinity for liberal progressive
  society which is open and changing whereas closed individuals prefer conservative traditional right wing views 
 this trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join so here 's the description of a group i found on the web 
 what kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world 
 and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all this is from some guy named ted
  's see now  if openness predicts who becomes liberal  and openness predicts who becomes a tedster then might we predict that most tedsters are liberal 
 let 's find out i 'm going to ask you to raise your hand whether you are liberal left of center on social issues we 're talking about primarily
 or conservative and i 'll give a third option because i know there are a number of libertarians in the audience so
  please raise your hand down in the simulcast rooms too let 's let everybody see who 's here
 please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center  please raise your hand high right now ok 
 please raise your hand if you 'd say you 're libertarian  ok  about a
 two dozen and please raise your hand if you 'd say you are right of center or conservative
  because if our goal is to understand the world to seek a deeper understanding of the world our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder 
 because when people all share values when people all share morals they become a team and once you engage the psychology of teams  it shuts down open minded thinking
 when the liberal team loses as it did in two thousand and four and as it almost did in two thousand
 we comfort ourselves we try to explain why half of america voted
 for the other team  we think they must be blinded by religion or
 by simple stupidity
  if you think that half of america votes republican because they are blinded in this way 
 then my message to you is that you 're trapped in a moral matrix in a particular moral matrix and by the matrix i mean literally the matrix like the movie the matrix 
 but i 'm here today to give you a choice  
 you can either take the blue pill
  and stick to your comforting delusions or you can take the red pill learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix now
 because i know ok
 i assume that answers my question i was going to ask you which one you picked but no need you 're all high in openness to experience  and besides 
 it looks like it might even taste good and you 're all epicures so anyway  let 's go with the red pill  let 's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us 
  psychology
 is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth  developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds and
 programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others  the best definition of innateness i 've ever seen this just clarifies so many things for me is from the brain
 scientist gary marcus he says the initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience 
 nature provides a first draft which experience then revises built in doesn 't mean unmalleable it means organized in advance of experience 
 ok so what 's on the first draft of the moral mind 
 to find out 
 my colleague craig joseph and i read through the literature on anthropology on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology looking for matches what are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines that you find across cultures and even across species
  we found five five best matches which we call the five foundations of morality  the first one is harm care we 're all mammals here we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really 
 bond with others care for others feel compassion for others especially the weak and vulnerable it gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm 
  there 's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals but the evidence for people could not be clearer  this norman rockwell painting is called the golden rule and we heard about this from karen armstrong of course as the foundation of so many
 religions that second foundation underlies the other thirty percent of the moral statements i 've heard here at ted the third foundation is in group loyalty
 do find groups
 in the animal kingdom you do find cooperative groups but these groups are always either very small or they 're all siblings  it 's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate 
  join together into groups but in this case groups that are united to fight other groups this probably comes from our long history of tribal living of tribal psychology 
 laughter sports is to war as pornography is to sex we get to exercise
 some ancient ancient drives
  the fourth foundation is authority respect here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species  
 but authority in humans is is not so closely based on on power and brutality as it is in other primates
  it 's based on more voluntary deference and even elements of love at times 
 the fifth foundation is purity sanctity
 this painting is called the allegory of chastity 
 but purity 's not just about suppressing female sexuality  it 's about any kind of ideology any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body by controlling what you put into your body  and while the political
 right may moralize sex much more the political left is really doing a lot of it with food food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays and a lot of it is ideas about purity about what you 're willing to touch or put
  into your body  
 i believe these are the five best candidates for what 's written on the first draft of the moral mind i think this is what we come with at least a preparedness to learn all of these things  
 but as my son max grows up in a liberal college town how is this first draft going to get revised and how will it end up being different
 from a kid born sixty miles south of
  to think about culture variation  let 's try a different metaphor  if there really are five systems at work in the mind
 five sources of intuitions and emotions then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels where you can set it to a different setting on every channel 
 and my colleagues brian nosek and jesse graham and i 
 made a questionnaire  which we put up on the web at
 and so far thirty thousand people have taken have taken this questionnaire and you can too here are the results here are the results from about
 american citizens 
 on the left i 've plotted the scores for liberals on the right those for conservatives in the middle the moderates the blue line shows you people 's responses on the average of all the harm questions  so as you see people care about harm 
  and care issues they give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board  but as you also see liberals care about it a little more than conservatives the line slopes down same story for fairness  
  are very low liberals are basically saying no this is not morality in group authority purity this stuff has nothing to do with morality i reject it but as people get more conservative the values rise 
 we can say that liberals have a kind of a 
  morality conservatives have more 
 morality  we find this in every country we look at here 's the data for one thousand one hundred canadians i 'll just flip through a few other slides
  new zealand western europe eastern europe  latin america the middle east east asia and south asia notice also that on all of these graphs the slope is steeper on in group authority purity which shows that within any country 
 the disagreement isn 't over harm and fairness everybody i mean  we debate over what 's fair but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter
 moral arguments within cultures are especially
  this effect is so robust
 that we find it no matter how we ask the question in one recent study we asked people to suppose you 're about to get a dog you picked a particular breed you learned some new information about the breed suppose you learn that this particular breed is
 independent minded and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal  well if you are a liberal you say hey that 's great because liberals like to say fetch  please 
  but if you 're conservative 
 that 's not so attractive if you 're conservative and you learn that a dog 's extremely loyal to its home and family and doesn 't warm up quickly to strangers for conservatives well loyalty is good dogs ought to be loyal but to a 
 liberal it sounds like this dog is running for the republican nomination 
 so you might say ok  there are these differences between liberals and conservatives but what makes those three other foundations moral aren 't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and puritanism what makes them moral the answer i think is contained
  in this incredible triptych from hieronymus bosch 
 the garden of earthly delights in the first panel  we see the moment of creation 
 all is ordered all is beautiful all the people and animals are doing what they 're supposed to be doing where they 're supposed to be 
 but then given the way of the world things change we get every person doing whatever he wants with every aperture of every other person and every other animal 
 some of you might recognize this as the
  but the ' 60s inevitably gives way
 to the ' 70s where the
 cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more of course bosch called this hell  so this this triptych these three panels
 portray the timeless truth
 that order tends to decay the truth of social entropy  but lest you think this is just some part of the christian imagination where christians have this weird problem with pleasure
  pleasure here 's the same story the same progression told in a paper that was published in nature a few years ago in which
 ernst fehr and simon gachter had people play a commons dilemma a game in which you give people money
 and then on each round of the game they can put money into a common pot  and then the experimenter doubles what 's in there and then it 's all divided among the players so it 's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues where we 're asking people to make a sacrifice and they
  themselves don 't really benefit from their own sacrifice but you really want everybody else to sacrifice but everybody has a temptation to a free ride  and what happens
 is that at first people start off reasonably cooperative and this is all played anonymously 
 on the first round people give about half of the money that they can but they quickly see you know what other people aren 't doing so much though i don 't want to be a sucker i 'm not going to cooperate
  and so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good down to close to zero  but then and here 's the trick fehr and gachter said on the seventh round they told people you know what 
 new rule if you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren 't contributing you can do that 
 and as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on cooperation shoots up it shoots up and it keeps going up there 's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems it really helps it 's not enough to just appeal to people 's good motives it really helps to have some sort of punishment
  if it 's just shame or embarrassment or gossip  you need some sort of punishment to bring people when they 're in large groups to cooperate there 's even some recent research suggesting that religion
 priming god making people think about god often in some situations leads to more cooperative more pro social behavior
  some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere in part for the purpose of
  trusting each other and then being more effective at competing with other groups  i think that 's probably right although this is a controversial issue
 but i 'm particularly interested in religion and the origin of religion and in what it does to us and for us 
 because i think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the grand canyon the grand canyon is really simple it 's just a lot of rock and then a lot of water and wind and a lot of
  and you get the grand canyon it 's not that complicated  this is what 's really complicated that there were people living in places like the grand canyon  cooperating with each other or on the savannahs of africa or on the frozen shores of alaska 
  and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of babylon and rome and tenochtitlan  how did this happen this is an absolute miracle much harder to explain than the grand canyon  the answer i think is that they used every tool in the toolbox 
  but it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub groups and if those sub groups have some internal structure  
 and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality to pursue higher nobler ends  
 and now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives  because liberals reject three of these foundations they say no let 's celebrate diversity
  let 's question authority and they say keep your laws off my body 
 liberals have very noble motives for doing this traditional authority  traditional morality can be quite repressive and restrictive to those at the bottom  to women to people that don 't fit in 
 so liberals speak for the weak and oppressed  they want change and justice even at the risk of chaos this guy 's shirt says stop bitching start a revolution if you 're high in openness to experience revolution is good it 's change it 's fun 
 conservatives
  on the other hand speak for institutions and traditions  they want order even at some cost to those at the bottom  
 the great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve it 's really precious and it 's really easy to lose so as edmund burke said the restraints on men as well as their liberties are to be reckoned among their rights this was after the chaos of the french revolution  
 so once you see this once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute that they form a balance on on change versus stability
 then i think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix
 this is the great insight that all the asian religions
 have attained 
 think about yin and yang yin and yang aren 't enemies yin and yang don 't hate each other yin and yang are both necessary like night and day for the functioning of the world  you find the same thing in hinduism
  there are many high gods in hinduism two of them are vishnu the preserver and shiva the destroyer  
 this image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body  you have the markings of vishnu on the
  left so we could think of vishnu as the conservative god  you have the markings of shiva on the right  shiva 's the liberal god  and they work together 
 you find the same thing in buddhism these two stanzas contain i think the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology 
 from the zen master seng ts 'an if you want the truth to stand clear before you never be for or against the struggle between for and against is the mind 's worst disease
 it 's a disease that has been caught by many of the world 's leaders  but before you feel superior to george bush before you throw a stone ask yourself do you accept this 
 do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil can you be not for or against anything  
 so what 's the point what should you do well  if you take the greatest insights from ancient asian philosophies and religions and you combine them with the latest
  research on moral psychology  i think you come to these conclusions that our righteous minds were designed by evolution
 to unite us into teams  to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth so
 what should you do am i telling you to not strive  am i telling you to embrace seng ts 'an and stop stop with this struggle
 of for and against no absolutely not i 'm not saying that
  is an amazing group of people
 who are doing so much using so much of their of their talent their brilliance their energy their money 
 to make the world a better place to fight to fight wrongs  to solve problems
  but as we learned from samantha power in her
 story about sergio vieira de mello  you can 't just go charging in saying you 're wrong and i 'm right
 everybody thinks they are right a lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people 
 and if you want to change other people a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are
 understand our moral psychology understand that we all think we 're right
 and then step out even if it 's just for a moment step
  step out of the moral matrix just try to see it as as a struggle playing out in which everybody does think they 're right and everybody at least has some reasons even if you disagree with them everybody has some reasons for what they 're doing 
 step out and if you do that 
 that 's the essential move to cultivate moral humility  to get yourself out of this self righteousness which is the normal human condition think about the dalai lama think about the enormous moral authority
 of the dalai lama and it
  to make the world a better place
