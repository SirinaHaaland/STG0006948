  is a different kind of death it 's bigger 
 we didn 't really realize that until one thousand nine hundred and fourteen when the last passenger pigeon a female named martha  died at the cincinnati zoo
  this had been the most abundant bird in the world
 that 'd been in north america for six million years  suddenly it wasn 't here at all 
 flocks that were a mile wide and four hundred miles long used to darken the sun 
 aldo leopold said this was a biological storm
  and indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest from the mississippi to the atlantic from canada
 down to the gulf  but it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades what happened  well commercial hunting happened 
 these birds were hunted for meat
 that was sold by the
  was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up
 and slaughter them by the tens of thousands it was the cheapest source of protein in america 
 by the end of the century there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers  
 there 's an upside to the story this made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the american bison  and so these birds
 saved the buffalos
  a lot of other animals weren 't saved the carolina parakeet
 was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere it was hunted to death for its feathers  
 there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the heath hen it was loved they tried to protect it it died anyway a local newspaper spelled out there is no survivor there is no future  there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again there
 's a sense of deep tragedy that
  goes with these things and it happened to lots of birds that people loved  it happened to lots of mammals  
 another keystone species is a famous animal called the european aurochs there was sort of a movie made about it recently 
 and the aurochs was like the bison  this was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire europe and asian continent 
 from spain to korea
  the documentation of this animal goes back to the lascaux cave paintings  
 the extinctions still go on  there 's an ibex in spain called the bucardo it went extinct in two thousand 
 there was a marvelous animal a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in tasmania south of
  called the tasmanian tiger  
 it was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos a
 little bit of film was shot 
 sorrow
  out that using the dna in museum specimens fossils maybe up to two hundred
 thousand years old could be used to bring species back 
 what would you do where would you start well you 'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there 
 i started with my wife ryan phelan  who ran a biotech business called dna direct  
 and through her one of her colleagues
  george church one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed  
 so he and ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the wyss institute in harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons conservation ornithologists bioethicists  
 and fortunately passenger pigeon dna had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist
  named beth shapiro all she needed from those specimens at the smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue 
 because down in there is what is called ancient dna it 's dna which is pretty badly fragmented 
 but with good techniques now you can basically reassemble the whole genome then the question is can you reassemble
 with that genome the whole bird george church thinks you can 
 so in his book regenesis which i recommend he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species and he has a machine called the multiplex automated
  genome engineering machine it 's kind of like an evolution machine you try combinations of genes that you write
  one of george 's famous unreadable slides  nevertheless
 points out that there 's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair the
 passenger pigeon has one point three billion base pairs in its genome 
 so what you 're getting is the capability now of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene
  's what happens in normal hybridization anyway  so this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species
 with the genome of its closest living relative now along the way george points out that
 his technology the technology of synthetic biology is currently accelerating at four times the rate of moore 's law it 's been doing that since two
  thousand and five and it 's likely to continue  
 okay the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the  band tailed pigeon  they 're abundant there 's some around here 
 genetically the  band tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon  there 's just some bits that are  band tailed pigeon 
 if you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits  you 've got the extinct bird back  cooing at you 
  there 's work to do you have to figure out exactly what genes matter  so there 's genes for the short tail in the  band tailed pigeon genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon and
 so on with the red eye peach colored breast flocking and so on add them
 all up and the result won 't be perfect  
 but it should be be perfect enough because nature doesn 't do perfect either  
 so this meeting in boston led to three things
  first off ryan and i decided to create a nonprofit called revive and restore that would push de extinction generally
 and try to have it go in a responsible way  and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon  
 another direct result was a young grad student named ben novak who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was fourteen and had also learned how to work with ancient dna  himself sequenced the passenger pigeon  
 using money from his family and friends
 we hired him full time now 
 this photograph i took of him last year at the smithsonian he 's looking down at martha the last passenger pigeon alive
 so if he 's successful she won 't be the last the third result of the boston meeting was the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of
  but they 'd never met each other and
 national geographic got interested because national geographic has the theory that the last century  discovery was basically finding things  
 and in this century discovery is basically making things de extinction falls in that category so they hosted and funded this meeting and thirty five scientists they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists basically meeting to see if they had work to do
  some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical there 's three of them
 who are not just re creating ancient species they 're recreating extinct ecosystems
 in northern siberia in the netherlands and in hawaii  
 henri from the netherlands with a dutch last name i won 't try to pronounce is working on the aurochs  the aurochs is the
 ancestor of all
  and so basically its genome is alive it 's just unevenly distributed  
 so what they 're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive hardy looking cattle like that maremmana primitivo on the top there
 to rebuild over time with selective back breeding the aurochs 
 now re wilding is moving faster in korea than it is in america  and so the plan is
  areas all over europe they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job its old ecological role of clearing the somewhat barren closed canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it 
 another amazing story
 came from alberto
 alberto worked with the bucardo in spain the last bucardo was a female named celia who was still alive  but then
  they captured her  they got a little bit of tissue from her ear  they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen
  released her back into the wild but a few months later  she was found dead under a fallen tree  
 they took the dna from that ear  
 they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat the pregnancy came to term 
  sometimes interspecies clones have
 respiration problems this one had a malformed lung and died after ten minutes  
 but alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then and this will move ahead and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern spain
  pioneer of great depth is oliver ryder 
 at the san diego zoo his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over one thousand species over the last thirty five years  
 now when it 's frozen that deep  minus one hundred and ninety six degrees celsius the cells are intact and the dna is intact they 're basically
  so someone like bob lanza
 at advanced cell technology took some of that tissue from an endangered animal called the javan banteng put it in a cow the cow went to term  and
 what was born was a live healthy baby javan banteng  who thrived and is still alive  
 the most exciting thing for bob lanza is the ability now to take any kind of cell with induced pluripotent stem cells
 turn it into germ cells like sperm and eggs  
 so now we go to mike mcgrew who is a scientist at roslin institute in scotland  and mike 's doing miracles with birds  
 so he 'll take say falcon skin cells fibroblast 
 turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells since it 's so pluripotent it can become germ plasm 
 he then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo
 of a chicken egg so that that chicken will have basically the gonads of a falcon  you get a male and a female each of those and out of them comes falcons 
 real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens 
 ben novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting he showed how all of this can be put together
  sequence of events he 'll put together the genomes of the  band tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon he 'll take the
 techniques of george church and get passenger pigeon dna the techniques of robert lanza and michael mcgrew get that dna into chicken gonads and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs  squabs 
  passenger pigeon parents to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon so what do you do about that 
 well birds are pretty hard wired as it happens so most of that is already in their dna  
 but to supplement it part of ben 's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds
 and feeding grounds
  were some conservationists really famous conservationists like stanley temple who is one of the founders of conservation biology  
 and kate jones from the iucn which does the red list  they 're excited about all this but they 're also concerned that it might be competitive
 with the extremely important efforts to protect endangered species that are still alive that haven 't gone extinct yet
  animals out there  you want to work on getting the market for ivory in asia down so you 're not using twenty five thousand elephants a year 
 but at the same time
 conservation biologists are realizing that bad news bums people out and so the red list is really important keep track of what 's endangered and critically endangered and so
  they 're about to create what they call a green list 
 and the green list will have species that are doing fine thank you 
 species that were endangered like the bald eagle but they 're much better off now  thanks to everybody 's good work  
 and protected areas around the world that are very very well managed so basically they 're learning how to build on good news  
 and they see
 reviving extinct species as the kind of good news you might be able to build on
  examples captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species the california condor was down to 
  and eighty seven everybody thought is was finished  
 thanks to captive breeding at the san diego zoo  there 's four hundred and five of them now  two hundred and twenty six are out in the wild 
 that technology will be used on de extincted animals another success story is the mountain gorilla in central africa
  one thousand nine hundred and eighty one dian fossey was sure they were going extinct there were just two hundred and fifty four left  now there are eight hundred and eighty  they 're increasing in population by three percent a year  
 the secret is they have 
  program which is absolutely brilliant  so this photograph was taken last month by ryan with an iphone 
 that 's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors
  another interesting project though it 's going to need some help is the northern white rhinoceros there 's no breeding pairs left but this is the kind of thing that a wide variety 
  of dna for this animal is available in the frozen zoo a bit of cloning you can get them back
  you want extinct species back do you want extinct species back 
 tinker bell is going to come fluttering down it
 is a tinker bell moment because what are
 people excited about with this what are they concerned about we 're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon
  so ben novak  even as we speak 
 is joining the group that beth shapiro has at uc santa cruz they 're going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the  band tailed pigeon 
 as that data matures they 'll send it to george church who will work his magic get passenger pigeon dna out of that we 'll get help from bob lanza and mike 
  mcgrew to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens that can produce passenger pigeon squabs that can be raised by
  from then on it 's passenger pigeons all the way maybe for the next six million years you can do the same thing as the costs come down for the carolina parakeet 
 for the great auk 
 for the heath hen for the ivory billed woodpecker for the eskimo curlew for the caribbean monk seal for the woolly mammoth 
 because the fact is humans have
  a huge hole in nature in the last ten thousand years 
 we have the ability now  and maybe the moral obligation to repair some of the damage  
 most of that we 'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species  
 but some species that we killed off totally
 we could
  consider bringing back to a world that misses them 
  emotional topic some people stand i suspect there are some people out there
 sitting kind of asking tormented questions almost about well wait wait wait wait wait wait a minute 
 there 's something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way  there 's going to be
 unintended consequences you 're going to uncork some sort of pandora 's box of
  do they have a point stewart brand well
 the earlier point is we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct  
 and many of them were keystone species and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go 
 now  there 's the shifting baseline problem which is so when these things come back they might replace some birds that are there
  slow process one of the things i like about it 
 we will get woolly mammoths back ca well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling thank you so much for
