  friend 's house and she had on her shelf a copy of the dsm manual  which is the manual of mental disorders it lists every known mental
  and it used to be back in the ' 50s a very slim pamphlet and then it got
 bigger and bigger and bigger and now it 's
 eight hundred and eighty six pages long and it lists currently three hundred and seventy four mental disorders  so i was leafing through it wondering if
 i had any mental disorders and it turns out i 've got twelve i 've got generalized anxiety disorder  which is a
  i 've got nightmare disorder  which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure  and
 all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going
  malingering and generalized anxiety disorder because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious  anyway i was looking through this book wondering if i was much crazier than i thought i was 
 or maybe it 's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you 're not a trained professional 
  disorder i didn 't know which of these was true but i thought it was kind of interesting and i thought maybe i should
 meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view  which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists 
 it was a man called brian who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies they 're called the cchr  
 and i said to him
  prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo science that can 't be trusted
  it 's where they send the serial killers and the people who can 't help themselves and
 i said to brian well what did tony do and he said  hardly anything he
 beat someone up or something  and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence  but he faked
  now he 's stuck in broadmoor
 and nobody will believe he 's sane do you want us to try and get you into broadmoor to meet tony so i said yes please 
 so i got the train to broadmoor i began to yawn uncontrollably around kempton park 
 which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious they yawn uncontrollably
  center  which is where you get to meet the patients  it looks like a giant
 hampton inn  it 's all peach and pine and calming colors and the only
 bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons and the patients started drifting in and they were quite
  the worst evil in the world but i 'm thinking it 's probably a good idea 
 and then brian said here 's tony and a man was walking in and he wasn 't overweight he was in very good physical
  he was wearing a pinstripe suit and he had his arm outstretched like someone out of the apprentice he looked like
 a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was
 very sane  
 and he sat down and i said so is it true that you faked your way in here 
 and he said yep yep absolutely i beat someone up when i was seventeen and i was in prison awaiting trial and my cellmate said to me ' you know what you have to do
  fake madness 
 tell them you 're mad you 'll get sent to some cushy hospital  nurses will bring you pizzas you 'll have your own playstation ' i said well how did you do it he said well i asked to see the
 prison psychiatrist and i 'd just seen a film called ' crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls
  a biography of ted bundy that they had at the prison library anyway he faked madness
 too well  he said and they didn 't send him to some cushy hospital
 and the minute he got there said he took one look at the place asked to see the psychiatrist said there 's been a terrible misunderstanding  i 'm not mentally ill 
 i said how long have you been here for 
 he said well if i 'd just done my time in prison for the original crime i 'd have got five years  
 i 've been in broadmoor for twelve years 
 tony said that it 's a lot harder
 to convince people you 're sane than it is to convince them you 're crazy he said 
 i thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what 's on tv  
 i subscribe to new scientist and recently they had an article about how the u s army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives
  did you know that the u s army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives '
 when i read my medical notes i saw they 'd written ' believes bees can sniff out explosives ' he said 
 you know they 're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state  but
 how do you sit in a sane way how do you cross your legs in a sane way it 's just impossible when tony said that to me i thought to myself am i
 sitting like a journalist
 am i crossing my legs like a journalist he said  you know  i 've got the
 stockwell strangler on one side of me  
 and i 've got the ' tiptoe through the tulips ' rapist on the other side of me  so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening  and they take that as a sign of madness  they say it proves that i 'm aloof
  only in broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness anyway he seemed completely normal to me but what did i know 
 and when i got home i emailed his clinician anthony maden i said what 's the story 
 and he said yep we accept that tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because
 his hallucinations that had seemed quite cliche to begin with just
  vanished the minute he got to broadmoor however  we have assessed him and we 've determined that what he is
 is a psychopath 
 and in fact faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath it 's on the checklist cunning manipulative 
 so faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong  and i spoke to other experts and
 they said the pinstripe suit classic psychopath speaks to items one and two on
  the checklist  glibness superficial charm and grandiose sense of self worth and i said well but why didn 't he hang out with the
 the other patients classic psychopath it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy so all the things that had seemed most
 normal about tony was evidence according
 to his clinician that he was mad in this new way  he was a psychopath  and his clinician said to me if you want to know more
  about psychopaths you can go on a
 course run by robert hare who invented the psychopath checklist so i did i went on a  psychopath spotting course and i am now
 a certified and i have to say extremely adept psychopath spotter 
  's the statistics one in a hundred regular people is a psychopath so there 's one
 thousand five hundred people in his room  fifteen of you are psychopaths  
 although that figure rises to four percent of
 ceos and business leaders so i think there 's a very good chance there 's about
 thirty or forty psychopaths in this room
  be carnage by the end of the night 
 laughter hare said the reason why is because
 capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior the
 lack of empathy the glibness  cunning
  in fact capitalism perhaps at its most remorseless is a physical manifestation of psychopathy it 's like a form of psychopathy that 's
 come down to
 affect us all
 hare said you know what forget about some guy at broadmoor who
 may or may not have faked madness who cares that 's not a big story the big story he said is corporate psychopathy you want to go and interview yourself
  so i gave it a try i wrote to the
 enron people i said could i come and interview you in prison to find out it you 're psychopaths and
 they didn 't reply 
 so i changed tack i emailed chainsaw al dunlap the
 asset stripper from the 
 he would come into failing businesses and close down thirty percent of the workforce just turn american towns into
  ghost towns and
 i emailed him and i said i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and
 interested in the predatory spirit and fearless can i come and interview you about your special brain anomaly and he said come on over 
 so i went to al dunlap 's grand
  've got sharks and he was saying this in a less effeminate way you 've got more sharks and you 've got
 tigers it was like narnia 
 and then we went into his kitchen
 now al dunlap would be brought in to
 save failing companies he 'd close down thirty percent of the workforce and he 'd quite often fire people with a joke like
 for instance one famous story about him somebody came up to him and said i 've just bought myself a new car and he said  well you may have a new car but i 'll tell you what you don 't have
  so in his kitchen he was in there with his wife judy and his bodyguard sean and i said you know how i said in my email that you might have a special
 brain anomaly that makes you special he said yeah it 's an amazing theory it 's like star trek you 're going where no man has gone before and i said
  i 've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket can i
 go through them with you and he looked intrigued despite himself and he said okay go on and i said okay  
 grandiose sense of self worth which i have to say would have been
  who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions
  going down the psychopath checklist basically turning it into who moved my cheese 
 but i did notice something happening to me the day i was with al dunlap whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal like 
  he said no to juvenile delinquency he said he got accepted into west point  and
  's only ever been married twice admittedly his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like but people say
 stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument and his second marriage has lasted forty one years  so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of 
  i thought to myself well i 'm not going to put that in my book  and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned
 me a little bit psychopathic because i was desperate to shove him in a
 box marked psychopath i was desperate to define him by his
 maddest edges and i realized my god this is what i 've been doing for twenty years it 's what all journalists do we travel across the world with our notepads
  we wait for the gems  and the gems are always the
 outermost aspects of our interviewee 's personality and we stitch them together like medieval monks and we
 leave the normal stuff on the floor  and you know this is a country that
  certain mental disorders hugely childhood bipolar children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums
  which scores them high on the
 bipolar checklist  when i got back to london tony phoned me he said why haven 't you been returning my calls
  say you feel remorse for your crime they say ' typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn 't ' it 's like witchcraft  they turn everything 
  i 've got a tribunal coming up will you come to it 
 so i said okay  so i went to his tribunal and after fourteen years in broadmoor they let him go
  decided that he shouldn 't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of
 recidivism so they let him go and outside in the corridor he said to me you know what jon everyone 's a bit psychopathic
  to go to belgium there 's a woman there that i fancy but she 's married so i 'm going to have to get her split up from her husband 
 anyway that was two years ago and that 's where my book ended and for the last twenty
  everything was fine nothing bad happened he was living with a girl outside london  he was according to brian the scientologist making up for lost time  
 which i know sounds ominous but isn 't necessarily ominous  
 unfortunately after twenty months he did go back to jail for
 a month he
 got into a fracas in a bar he called it ended up going to jail for a month which i know is bad but at least a month implies that
  't too bad  and then he phoned me  and you know what i think it 's right
 that tony is out because you shouldn 't define people by their maddest edges and what tony is is he 's 
 he 's a gray area in a world that
  the gray areas are where you find
 the complexity it 's where you find the
 humanity and it 's where you find the truth 
 and tony said to me jon
  could i buy you a drink in a bar i just want to thank you for everything you 've done for me and i didn 't go what would
  you have done thank you
