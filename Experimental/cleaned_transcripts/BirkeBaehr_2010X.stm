  my name is birke baehr and i 'm eleven years old  i came here today to talk about what 's wrong with our food system  
 first of all i would like to say that i 'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on tv at public schools and pretty much everywhere
  else you look it seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids like me to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn 't good for us or the planet 
 little kids especially are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys  i must admit  i used to be one of them  
 i also used to think that all of our food came from these happy little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day
 what i discovered was this is not true  
 i began to look into this stuff on the internet in books and in documentary films in my travels with my family  
 i discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system  
 first there 's genetically engineered seeds and organisms that is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature like taking the dna of a fish and putting it
  into the dna of a tomato  yuck don 't get me wrong i like fish and tomatoes  but this is just creepy 
 the seeds are then planted  then grown the food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s and
 most folks don 't even know
  did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity 
 these include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight  yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way  and let me tell you corn is in everything 
 and don 't even get me started on the confined animal feeding operations called cafos 
 laughter conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow
  they do this because they 've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again  
 next more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables like pesticides and herbicides to kill weeds and bugs  
 when it rains these chemicals seep into the ground  or run off into our waterways  poisoning our water too
  then they irradiate our food trying to make it last longer  so it can travel thousands of miles from where it 's grown to the supermarkets  
 so i ask myself how can i change how can i change these things this is what i found out i discovered that there 's a movement for a better way  
 now a while back i wanted to be an nfl football player  
 i decided that i 'd rather be an organic farmer instead
  i can have a greater impact on the world 
 this man  joel salatin they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system  
 since i 'm home schooled i went to go hear him speak one day 
 this man this lunatic farmer doesn
  or genetically modified seeds and so for that he 's called crazy by the system
  i want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices by buying our food directly from local farmers or our neighbors who we know in real life 
 some people say organic or local food is more expensive  but is it really 
 with all these things i 've been learning about the food system  it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer or we can pay the hospital
 now i know definitely which one i would choose  i want you to know 
  that there are farms out there like bill keener in sequatchie cove farm in tennessee whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud just like i thought  
  vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from  
 i want you to know that there are farmers ' markets in every community popping up  i want you to know that me my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips  i try to share this everywhere i go 
 not too long ago my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal
  he asked him if he wanted organic toasted o 's or the sugarcoated flakes you know the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front
  my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic toasted o 's cereal because birke said he shouldn 't eat sparkly cereal 
 and that my friends is how we can make a difference one kid at a time so next time you 're at the grocery store think local choose organic know your farmer and know your food  thank you
