  early days of twitter it was like a place of radical 
 people would admit shameful secrets about themselves  and other people would say oh my god  i 'm exactly the same 
 voiceless people realized that they had a voice and it was powerful and eloquent
 if a newspaper
 ran some racist or homophobic column  we realized we could do something about it we could get them we could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn 't
 a social media shaming 
 advertisers would withdraw their advertising when powerful people misused their privilege  we were going to get them 
  democratization of justice  hierarchies were being leveled out  we were going to do things better 
 soon after that a disgraced pop science writer called jonah lehrer he 'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes  and he was drenched in shame and regret he told me  and he had the opportunity
  to publicly apologize at a foundation lunch this was going to be the most important speech of his life maybe it would win him some salvation 
 he knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be 
  his event but what he didn 't know until he turned up was that they 'd erected a giant screen twitter feed right next to his head 
 laughter another one in a monitor screen in his
  the foundation did this because they were monstrous 
 i think they were clueless i think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of twitter was hitting the increasingly horrific reality  
 and here were some of the tweets that were cascading into his eye line as he was trying to apologize jonah lehrer boring us into forgiving him 
 and jonah lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame that one must have been written by the
  psychiatrist ever to know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern and jonah lehrer is just a 
 that last word is a very human thing to do to dehumanize the people we hurt  it 's because we want to destroy people but not feel bad about it 
 imagine if this was an actual court and the accused was in the dark
  for another chance and the jury was yelling out bored 
 you know when we watch courtroom dramas we tend to identify with the kindhearted defense attorney  
 but give us the power and we become like hanging judges 
 power shifts fast  we were getting jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege  but jonah was on the floor
  then and we were still kicking and congratulating ourselves for punching up 
 and it began to feel weird and empty when there wasn 't a powerful person who had misused their privilege that we could get 
 a day without a shaming began to feel like a day picking fingernails
 and treading water let me tell you a story it 's about a woman called justine
  sacco  
 she was a pr woman from new york with one hundred and seventy twitter followers  and she 'd tweet little acerbic jokes to them like this one on a plane from new york to london
  internet doesn 't congratulate us for being funny 
 laughter black silence when the internet doesn 't talk back 
 and then she got to heathrow and she had a little time to spare before her final leg so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke
  got no replies  turned off her phone fell asleep 
 woke up eleven hours later turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway 
 and straightaway there was a message from somebody that she hadn 't spoken to since high school that said 
 i am so sorry to see what 's happening to you 
 and then another message from a best friend you need to call me right now
  are the worldwide number one trending topic on twitter 
 what had happened is that one of her one hundred and seventy followers had sent the tweet to a gawker journalist and he retweeted it to his fifteen thousand followers [ and now a funny holiday joke from iac 's pr boss ]
 and then it was like a bolt of lightning a few weeks later i talked to the gawker journalist i emailed him and asked him how it felt
  delicious and then he said but i 'm sure she 's fine 
 but she wasn 't fine  because while she slept twitter took control of her life
 and dismantled it piece by piece first there were the philanthropists
  was anybody on twitter that night
 a few of you did justine 's
 joke overwhelm your twitter feed the way it did mine 
 it did mine and i thought what everybody thought that night  which was wow somebody 's screwed  somebody 's life is about to
  sat up in my bed and i put the pillow behind my head and
 then i thought 
 i 'm not entirely sure that joke was intended to be racist maybe instead of gleefully flaunting her privilege she was mocking the gleeful flaunting of privilege 
  there 's a comedy tradition of this like south park or colbert or randy newman 
  i met justine a couple of weeks later in a bar she was just crushed  and i asked her to explain the joke  and she said 
 living in america puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third world  i was making of fun of that bubble 
 you know another woman on twitter that night a new statesman writer helen lewis she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she tweeted
  i 'm not sure that
 her joke was intended to be racist and she said straightaway she got a fury of tweets saying well you 're just a privileged bitch too and so to her shame she wrote  she shut 
  up and watched as justine 's life got torn apart 
 it started to get darker
  it was their duty to get her fired [ @ justinesacco last tweet of your career # sorrynotsorry
 corporations got involved hoping to sell their products on the back of justine 's annihilation
  googled forty times a month 
 that month between december the 20th and the end of december her name was googled one million two hundred and twenty thousand times
  and one internet economist told me that that meant that google made somewhere between one hundred and twenty thousand dollars and four hundred and sixty eight thousand dollars from justine
  should rape this bitch and then we 'll find out if her skin color protects her from aids 
 and that person got a free pass nobody went after that person we were all so
  excited about destroying justine and our shaming brains are so 
 we couldn 't also handle destroying somebody who was inappropriately destroying justine 
 justine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night from philanthropists to rape the bitch
  always have it worse than men when a man gets shamed it 's i 'm going to get you fired when a woman gets shamed it 's i 'm going to get you fired and raped and
 cut out your uterus and then justine 's employers got involved
  what we had was a delightful narrative arc  we knew something that justine didn 't 
 can you think of anything less judicial than this justine was
  plane and unable to explain herself  and her inability was a huge part of the hilarity 
 on twitter that night  we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun 
 somebody worked out exactly which plane she was on so they linked to a flight tracker website
  looks like to discover that you 've just been torn to shreds because of a misconstrued liberal joke not by
  trolls  but by nice people like us this is what it looks like [ she 's decided to wear sunnies as a disguise ]
 so why did we do it 
 i think some people were genuinely upset  but i think for other people it 's because twitter is basically a mutual approval machine we surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do
 we approve each other and that 's a really good feeling and if somebody gets in the way we screen them out and do you know what that 's the opposite of it 's the opposite of democracy  
 we wanted to show that we cared about people dying of aids in africa 
 our desire to be seen to be compassionate is what led us to commit this profoundly un compassionate act 
 as meghan o 'gieblyn wrote in the boston review this isn 't social justice  it 's a cathartic alternative
  past three years i 've been going around the world meeting people like justine sacco and believe me there 's a lot of people like justine sacco there 's more every day  
 and we want to think they 're fine  but they 're not fine 
 the people i met were mangled 
 they talked to me about depression and anxiety and insomnia and suicidal thoughts 
 one woman i talked to who also told a joke that landed badly
  stayed home for a year and a half before that she worked with adults with learning difficulties  and was apparently really good at her job 
 justine was fired of course because social media demanded it  
 but it was worse than that she was losing herself  she was waking up in the middle of the night
  who she was  
 she was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege  and of course that 's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for like having children out of wedlock but
 the phrase misuse of privilege is becoming a free pass to tear apart pretty much anybody we choose to  
 it 's becoming a devalued term and it 's making us lose our capacity for empathy and for distinguishing between serious and unserious transgressions
 justine had one hundred and seventy twitter followers  and so to make it work she had to be fictionalized 
 word got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire desmond sacco
 early days of twitter when people would admit shameful secrets about themselves and other people would say oh my god i 'm exactly the same 
 these days the hunt is on for people 's shameful secrets 
 you can lead a good ethical life but some bad phraseology in a tweet can overwhelm it all become a clue to your secret
  maybe there 's two types of people in the world those people who favor humans over ideology  and those people who favor ideology over humans  
 i favor humans over ideology  but right now the ideologues are winning 
 and they 're creating a stage for constant artificial high dramas where everybody 's either a magnificent hero or a sickening villain
  even though we know that 's not true about our fellow humans what 's true is that we are clever and stupid 
 what 's true is that we 're grey areas 
 the great thing about social media was how it gave a voice to voiceless people but we 're now creating a surveillance society where the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless 
 let 's not do that
  strikes me about justine 's story is also the fact that if you google her name today this story covers the first one hundred pages of google results there is nothing else about
  in your book  you mention another story of another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm and
 by creating blogs and posting nice  innocuous stories about her love for cats and holidays and  stuff managed to get the story off the first couple pages of google results  but it didn 't last long a couple of weeks later they started creeping back up
 to the top result 
  i think the very best thing we can do if you see a kind of unfair or an ambiguous shaming
 is to speak up because i think the worst thing that happened to justine was that nobody supported her like everyone was against her and that is profoundly traumatizing 
 to be told by tens of thousands of people that you need to get out  but if a shaming happens and there 's a babble of voices like in a democracy  where people are discussing it i think that 's much less damaging so
 i think that 's the
  way forward but it 's hard because if you do stand up for somebody
 it 's incredibly unpleasant bg so let 's talk about your experience because you stood up by writing this book by the way it 's mandatory reading for everybody okay
  you stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers 
 and i assume you didn 't only have friendly reactions on twitter jr it didn 't go down that
  you don 't want to just concentrate because lots of people
 understood and were really nice about the book but yeah  for thirty years i 've been writing stories about abuses of power and
 when i say the powerful people over there in the military or in the pharmaceutical industry everybody applauds me as soon as i say we are the powerful people abusing our power now i get people
  you were talking with people around the table and that was a nice constructive discussion on the other every time you turned to your phone there is this deluge of insults jr yeah this happened last night we had like a ted dinner last night 
  we were chatting and it was lovely and nice and i decided to check twitter somebody said you are a white supremacist and then i went back and had a nice conversation
  i went back to twitter  somebody said my very existence made the world a worse place my friend adam curtis says that
 maybe the internet is like a john carpenter movie from the 1980s when eventually everyone will start screaming at each other and shooting each other and then eventually everybody would 
  flee to somewhere safer  and i 'm starting to think of that as a really nice option
