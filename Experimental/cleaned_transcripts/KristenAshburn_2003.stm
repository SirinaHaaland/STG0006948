  when i first arrived in beautiful zimbabwe  it was difficult to understand that thirty five percent of the population
 is hiv positive  it
 really wasn 't until i was
  invited to the homes of people that i started to understand the human toll
 of the epidemic for instance this is
 herbert with his grandmother when i first met him he was sitting on his grandmother 's lap he has been orphaned  as both of his parents died of aids  and 
 his grandmother took care of him until he too died of aids  he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed 
 got up to make tea she placed him in my own lap and i had never felt a child that that was that emaciated
 before i left i actually asked him if i could get him something i thought he would ask for a toy or candy and
 he asked me for slippers because he said that his feet were cold this is joyce who 's in this picture
 twenty one single mother hiv positive  i photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl  issa
 and i was last week walking on lafayette street in manhattan and got a call from a woman
 who i didn 't know  but she called to tell me that joyce had passed away
 at the age of  twenty three joyce 's mother is now taking care of her daughter  like so many other zimbabwean children who 've been orphaned
 by the epidemic  so a few of the stories with every picture  there are
 individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told all these pictures are from zimbabwe
  him
  tell your own story
  was working at the time doing production for a fashion photographer 
 and i was constantly reading the new york times and stunned by
 the statistics the numbers it was just frightening so i quit my job
 and decided that that 's the subject that i wanted to tackle and i first actually went to botswana  where i spent
  month this is in december two thousand
 then went to zimbabwe for a month and a half 
 and then went back again this march two thousand and two for another month and a half in zimbabwe ca that 's an amazing story
