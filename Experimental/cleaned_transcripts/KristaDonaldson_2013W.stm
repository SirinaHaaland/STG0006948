  years ago i worked for the u s government in iraq helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure  
 and i was there and i worked in that job because i believe that technology can improve
 people 's lives 
 one afternoon i had tea with a storekeeper at the al rasheed hotel in baghdad  and he said to me 
 you americans  you can put a man on the moon but when i get home tonight i won 't be able to turn on my lights 
 at the time the u s government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction how do you ensure technology
  how do you put it in their hands so that it is useful 
 so those are the questions that my colleagues and i at d rev ask ourselves and d rev is short for design revolution  
 and i took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users  and not just any users  but customers who live on less than four dollars a
  one of the key areas we 've been working on recently is medical devices and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with iraq 's electricity grid then 
 there are some commonalities  
 despite the advanced technology it 's not reaching the people who need it most so i 'm
 going to tell you about one of the projects we 've been working on the remotion knee  and it 's a prosthetic knee for above knee amputees  
 and this project started when the jaipur foot organization the largest fitter of
  prosthetic limbs in the world came to the bay area and they said we need a better knee 
 chances are if you 're living on less than four dollars a day  and you 're an amputee  
 you 've lost your limb in a vehicle accident most people think it 's land mines but it 's a vehicle accident you 're walking by the side of the road and you 're hit by a truck or
 you 're trying to to jump on a moving train you 're late for work  and your pant leg gets caught
  and the reality is is that if you don 't have much money like this young named kamal right here the option you really have
 is a bamboo staff to get around and how big a problem is this 
 there 's over three million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee  
 and what are their options this is a high end this is what we 'd call a smart knee it 's got a microprocessor inside
  it can pretty much do anything
 but it 's twenty thousand dollars and to give you a sense of who wears this veterans american veterans coming back from afghanistan or iraq would be fit with something like this 
 this is a low end titanium knee  it 's a polycentric knee  and all that that means is the mechanism is a four bar mechanism that mimics a
  hundred dollars it 's still too expensive for people like kamal 
 and lastly here you see a low end knee this is a knee that 's been designed specifically for poor people 
 and while you have affordability  you 've lost on functionality the mechanism here is a single axis and a single axis is like a door hinge  so you can think about how unstable that would be  
 and this is the type of mechanism that the jaipur foot organization was using when they were looking for a better knee and i just wanted to give you a sense
  of what a leg system looks like because i 'm showing you all these knees and i imagine it 's hard to think how it all fits together  
 so at the top you have a socket  and this fits over someone 's residual limb and everyone 's residual limb is a little bit different 
 and then you have the knee and here i 've got a single axis on the knee so you can see how it rotates and then a pylon  and then a foot  
 and we 've been able to develop a knee a polycentric knee so that type of knee
 that acts like a human knee  mimics human gait for eighty dollars retail 
 but the key is you can have this great invention you can have this great design but how do you get it to the people who most need it how do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives  
 so at d rev we 've done some other projects  and we looked at three things that we really believe
  technologies to customers to users to people who need it 
 and the first thing is that the product needs to be world class it needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market regardless of your income level you want the most beautiful the best product that there is i 'm
 going to show you a video now
  a man named ash you can see him walking he 's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee  and he 's doing a 10 meter walk test and you 'll notice that he 's struggling with stability as he 's walking  
 and something that 's not obvious that you can 't see is that it 's psychologically draining
 to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling 
 now this is a video of kamal you remember kamal earlier holding the bamboo staff he 's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee  and he 's doing that same
  walk test  and you can see his stability is much better 
 so world class isn 't just about technical performance it 's also about human performance  
 and most medical devices we 've learned as we 've dug in are really designed for westerners for wealthier economies  but the reality is is our users our customers  
 they do different things they sit
 cross legged more we see that they squat they kneel in prayer  and we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market  
 so the second thing we learned and this leads into my second point which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be 
 and at d rev we go one step further and we say you need to
  so it 's not just the end user that you 're thinking about but everyone who interacts with the product so for example the prosthetist who fits the knee  
 but also the context in which the knee is being fit what is the local market like how do all these components get to the clinic do they all get there on time  the supply chain everything that goes 
  into ensuring that this product gets to the end user and it goes in as part of the system and it 's used  
  first version the jaipur knee so this is it right here 
 notice anything about it 
 it clicks  
 we 'd seen that users had actually modified it so do you see that black strip right there that 's a homemade noise dampener  
  we also saw that our users had modified it in other ways  you can see there that that particular amputee he had wrapped bandages around the knee  he 'd made a cosmesis  and if you look at the knee  
 it 's got those pointy edges right  
 so if you 're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari it 's really obvious that you 're wearing a prosthetic limb and in societies where there 's social stigma around being disabled
  people are particularly acute about this  
 so i 'm going to show you some of the modifications we did we did a lot of iterations not just around this but some other things but here we have the version three the remotion knee but if you look in here you can see
 the noise dampener  
 it 's quieter  the other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile  we made it thinner  and something that 's not obvious is that we designed it
  and this goes into my last point we really truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it 's needed  it needs to be  market driven and  market driven means
 that products are sold they 're not donated they 're not heavily subsidized our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user  it also has to be designed to be very affordable 
 but a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer and use is what creates impact and we believe that as designers
  designers it holds us accountable to our customers  
 and with centralized manufacturing 
 you can control the quality control and you can hit that $ eighty price point with profit margins built in and now those profit margins are critical because if you want to scale if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee  it needs to be economically
  i want to give you a sense of where we are at  we have fit over five thousand amputees  
 and one of the big indicators we 're looking at of course is does it improve lives  well the standard is is
 someone still wearing their knee six months later  the industry average is about sixty five percent  ours is seventy nine percent 
 and we 're hoping to get that higher 
 right now  our knees are worn in twelve countries this is where we want to get though in the next three years
 we 'll double the impact in two thousand and fifteen and we 'll double it each of the following years after that 
 but then we hit a new challenge and that 's the number of skilled prosthetists who are able to fit knees  
 so i want to end with a story of 
  was eighteen years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg  and she traveled twelve hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with
 and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers 
 she 's particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman  because she was in school she had just started school to study engineering  
 and she said well now that i can walk again i can go back and complete my studies and to me she represents the next generation of engineers
 solving problems
  and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users
