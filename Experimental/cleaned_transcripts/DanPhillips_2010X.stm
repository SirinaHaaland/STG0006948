 between seventy and eighty percent recycled material stuff that was headed to the mulcher the landfill the burn pile
 it was all just gone this is the first house i built 
 this double front door here with the three light transom that was headed to the landfill 
 have a little turret there  and then these buttons on the corbels here
 right there those are hickory nuts and these
  buttons there those are chicken eggs of course first you have breakfast  and then you
 you fill the shell full of bondo and paint it and nail it up and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time
  this is a look at the inside you can see the three light transom there with the eyebrow windows  certainly an architectural antique
 headed to the landfill even the lockset is probably worth two hundred dollars
  in the kitchen was salvaged 
  merritt stove if you like to cook cool stove  this is going up into the turret  i got that staircase
 for twenty dollars including delivery to my lot 
 then looking up in the turret you see there are bulges and
  this is
 a laundry chute and this right here is a shoe last
 those are those cast iron things you see at antique shops so i had one of those so i made some  low tech gadgetry where you just stomp on the shoe last  and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down  
 and then if you 're
 smart enough it goes on a basket on top of the washer if not it goes goes into the toilet this
 is a bathtub i made made out of scrap two by four started with the rim  and then
 glued and nailed it up into a flat corbeled it up and flipped it over then did did the two profiles on this side it 's a two person tub
  after all it 's not just a question of hygiene but there 's a possibility
  this faucet here is just a piece of osage orange  it looks a little phallic but after all it 's a bathroom 
 this is a house based on a budweiser can it doesn 't look like a can of beer but the design take offs are absolutely unmistakable the barley hops 
  design worked up into the eaves then the dentil work comes directly off the can 's red white blue and silver 
 going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can i just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until i got the size i want then 
 on the can it says this is the famous budweiser beer we know of no other beer blah blah blah so we changed that and put this is the famous budweiser house  we don 't know of any other house and so forth and so on 
 this is a deadbolt it 's a fence from a 1930s shaper which is a very angry woodworking machine
  and they gave me the fence but they didn 't give me the shaper  so we made a deadbolt out of it that 'll keep bull elephants out i promise and sure enough we 've had
 no problems with bull elephants 
 the shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer  we 've got bubbles going up there then suds at the top with lumpy tiles where do you get lumpy tiles well of
  i get a lot of toilets and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer and then you have lumpy tiles and then
 the faucet is a beer tap 
 then  this
 panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle class front door in america  we 're getting tired of it it 's kind of clichd now if you put it in the front door 
 your design fails so don 't put it in the front door put it somewhere else it 's a pretty panel of glass
 but if you put it in the front door people say oh you 're trying to be like those guys and you didn 't make it so don 't put it there  
 then  another bathroom upstairs this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle class foyer in america 
 don 't put it in the foyer put it in the shower or in the closet but not in the foyer 
 then somebody gave me a bidet so it got a
 this little house here 
 those branches there are made out of bois d 'arc or osage orange  these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit in order to do
 what i do you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry our housing has become a commodity
  i 'll talk a little bit about that but the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our dna  human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass
  what does that mean  what it means is for every perception we have it needs to tally with the one like it before  or we don 't have continuity and we become a little bit disoriented  so i can show you an object you 've never seen before 
 that 's a cell phone  
  but you 've never seen this one before what you 're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features  and then you go through your databanks
  cell phone oh that 's a cell phone
 if i took a bite out of it you 'd go wait a second that 's not a cell phone that 's one of those new
 chocolate cell phones you 'd have to start a new category
  how we process information you translate that to the building industry if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked we go oh dear  
 that 's cracked let 's repair it let 's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in because that 's what you do with a cracked pane 
 never mind that it doesn 't affect our lives at all it only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural
  if we took a small hammer and we added cracks to all the other windows 
 then we have a pattern  because gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern we 'll go ooh 
 that 's nice so 
 that serves me every day repetition creates pattern if i have one hundred of these one hundred of those it makes no difference what these and those are if i can repeat anything 
 i have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs
  shards of glass branches it doesn 't make any difference  
 that causes a lot of waste in the building industry the second cause is friedrich nietzsche along about one thousand eight hundred and eighty five wrote a book titled the birth of tragedy 
 and in there  
 he said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives on the one hand we have an apollonian perspective  
 which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized
 and perfect
  on the other end of the spectrum we have a dionysian perspective which is more given to the passions and intuition tolerant of organic texture and human gesture  
 so the way the apollonian personality takes a picture
 or hangs a picture is they 'll get out a transit
 and a laser level and a micrometer ok honey a thousandth of an inch to the left that 's where we want the picture
  square and centered the dionysian personality takes the picture and goes 
 that 's the difference
  i feature blemish  i feature organic process dead center john dewey
  apollonian
  the third thing
 is arguably
 the industrial revolution started in the renaissance with the rise of humanism then got a little jump start along about the french revolution by the middle of the 19th century it 's in full flower  
 and we have dumaflaches and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything
 that we 
 up to that point had to do by hand so now we have standardized materials  well  trees don 't grow two inches by four inches eight ten and twelve feet tall 
 we create mountains of waste and they 're doing a pretty good job
 there in the forest working all the byproduct of their industry with
  and particle board and so forth and so on but it does no good
 to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption and that 's what 's happening  
 and so if something isn 't standard
  the fourth thing
 is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials well that 's just a myth 
 and there 's a story  jim tulles one of the guys i trained i said jim it
 's time now  i got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew time for you to go dan i just don 't think i 'm ready 
 jim now it 's time you 're the down oh 
  so we hired on and he was out there with a tape measure 
 going through the trash heap looking for header material or the board that goes over a door 
 thinking he 'd impress his boss that 's how we taught him to do it the superintendent walked up and said what are you doing oh just looking for header material waiting for that 
  not paying you to go through the trash get back to work and jim had the wherewithal to say you know  if you were paying me three hundred
  an hour i can see how you might say that but right now i 'm saving you five dollars a minute do the math 
 good call tulles from now on you guys hit this pile first and the irony is that he wasn 't very good at math but
 once in a while you get access to the control room and then you can kind of mess with the dials and that 's what happened there
 the fifth thing is that maybe after two thousand five hundred years plato is still having his way
  with us in his notion of perfect forms he said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want  
 and we force environmental resources to accommodate that so we all have in our head the perfect house the american dream  which is a house  the dream house 
 the problem is we can 't afford it so we have the american dream look alike which is a mobile
  now there 's a blight on the planet 
 it 's a chattel mortgage 
 just like furniture just like a car you write the check and instantly it depreciates thirty percent after a year you can 't get insurance on everything you have in it only on seventy percent 
 wired with 14 gauge wire typically nothing wrong with that unless you ask it to do what 12 gauge wire 's supposed to do and that 's what happens 
 it out gasses formaldehyde so much so
 that there is a federal law in place
 to warn new mobile
  home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger 
 are we just being numbingly stupid the walls are this thick the whole thing has the structural value of corn 
 so i thought palm harbor village was over there no no we had a wind last night  it 's gone now 
 then when they degrade what do you do with
  all that
 that apollonian platonic model is what the building industry is predicated on and there are a number of things that exacerbate that 
 one is that
 all the professionals all the tradesmen vendors 
 inspectors engineers architects all think like this  
 and then it works its way back to the consumer who demands the same model it 's a self fulfilling prophecy we can 't get out of
  then here come the marketeers and the advertisers 
 we buy stuff we didn 't know we needed 
 all we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice how disgusting 
 laughter but you know what they did they hooked a metaphor into it and said i drink dr pepper
  and pretty soon we 're swilling that stuff by the lake ful by the billions of gallons it doesn 't even have real prunes doesn 't even keep you regular 
 my oh my that makes it worse and we get sucked into that faster than anything 
 then a man named jean paul sartre wrote a book
 titled being and nothingness it 's a pretty quick read you can snap through it in maybe 
 maybe two years if
  read eight hours a day in there he talked about the divided self
 he said human beings act differently when they know they 're alone
 than when they know somebody else is around so if i 'm eating spaghetti  and i know i 'm alone i can eat like a backhoe  i can wipe my mouth on my sleeve
  napkin on the table chew with my mouth open 
 make little noises  scratch wherever i want 
 but as soon as you
  chew with my mouth closed no scratching now what i 'm doing is fulfilling
 your expectations of how i should live my life 
 i feel that expectation and so i accommodate it and i 'm living my life according to what you expect me to do 
 that happens in the building industry as well  that 's why
  the same sometimes we even have these formalized
 cultural expectations i 'll bet all your shoes match sure enough we all buy into that laughter
 and with gated communities  
 we have a formalized expectation with a homeowners ' association sometimes those guys are nazis my oh my 
 that exacerbates and continues
  the last thing is gregariousness  human beings are a social species we like to hang together in groups 
 just like wildebeests just like lions wildebeests don 't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests 
 human beings are like that we do what that group does that we 're trying to identify with
 you see this in junior high a lot those kids they 'll work all summer long kill themselves so that they can afford one
  pair of designer jeans  so along about september they can stride in and go i 'm important
 today see don 't
 touch my designer jeans  i see you don 't have designer jeans 
 you 're not one of the beautiful see i 'm one of the beautiful people see my jeans right there is reason enough to have uniforms 
 and so that happens in the building industry as well
  have confused maslow 's hierarchy of needs just a little bit 
 on the bottom tier we have basic needs shelter clothing food water  
 mating and so forth second  security third relationships fourth status self esteem that is vanity and we 're taking vanity and shoving it down here
  and so we end up
 with vain decisions 
 and we can 't even afford our mortgage we can 't afford to eat anything except beans that is our housing has become a commodity  
 and it takes a little bit of nerve
 to dive into those primal terrifying parts of ourselves
 and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity but make it something
  that bubbles up from seminal sources that takes a little bit of nerve and darn it  once in a while you fail but
 that 's okay  if failure destroys you then you can 't do this i fail
 all the time every day  and i 've had some whopping failures i promise  big 
  he tried it a fifth time and it still didn 't work what a moron early on  contractors come by and say dan you 're a cute little bunny but
 you know this just isn 't going to work what don 't you do this why don 't you do that and your instinct is to say well why don
 't you suck an egg 
 but you don 't say that  because they 're the guys you 're targeting and so what we 've done
  and this isn 't just in housing it 's in clothing and food and our transportation needs our energy we sprawl just a little bit and
 when i get a little bit of press  i hear from people all over the world and we may have invented excess  but the problem of waste is
  and i don 't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana 
 but we 're clearly in trouble  and what we need to do is reconnect with those
 really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say you know i think i would like to put
 cds across the wall there what do you think honey
  down what we need to do is reconnect with who we really are and that 's thrilling indeed  thank you very much
