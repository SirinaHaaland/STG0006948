  first of all for those of you who are not familiar with my work i create multicultural characters so characters from lots of different backgrounds
 so before the present is the new future a bit about the
  long story filled with intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame  but i was totally immersed in this world that was
 filled with everybody  and then i went on to the
  united nations school and that just completely so i began
 sort of developing these voices and these people  all of whom were loosely based on people i really know and so for example
  in performing them  i would really try to inhabit them  and for example  i don 't really talk
  that was one of my people  and i 'm going to bring a few of my friends i think of them as my friends to this stage in this spirit of the idea that the
 present is the new future in sort of a meta way  because i thought about it and the future for me  what can be so frightening is that i don 't know what 's coming  i don 't know if that 's true for other people but that notion of
 thinking about how we can understand the future and predict outcomes for me
  's terrifying to not know what might be coming and so the idea that there are questions that i 've never seen
 that my people are going to answer and some of these characters have been with me for ages some of them don 't even have names i don 't know what 's going to happen i don 't know what 's coming  
 and all i can do is remind myself that i told chris i 'd fly by the seat of my pants and now that i 'm up here it sort of feels like that dream where you
  don 't have any pants on and so i suppose i 'm going to be flying by the seat of my ass 
 that said let 's just see who comes out may we have the first question do you ever get headaches from the microchips implanted in your brain 
 right okay  well first of all i 'll just say that i hope you can hear me okay  my name is
  lorraine levine  and
 the idea of microchips implanted in my brain frankly
  just putting on my glasses reminds me of thank god i 'm not wearing the google glasses no offense to them  i 'm glad that you all enjoy them but at my age 
 just putting on the regular ones i have already gives me too much information
  understand what i 'm saying to you i don 't
 need to know more  i don 't want to know 
 that 's it  that 's enough i love you all you 're wonderful  it 's fabulous to be here with such big machers again this year
  hi everybody my name is nereida i just want to say first of all that dating is never boring under any circumstance  
 but i am very excited to be here right now so i am just trying to remind myself that you know like  the purpose of being here and everything i mean trying to answer these questions it is very exciting  
 but i also i just need to acknowledge that ted is an incredible experience right now in the present like
  i just need to say like isabel allende  isabel allende  okay maybe it doesn 't mean  of course it means something to you but to me it 's like another level  okay because i 'm latina and i really appreciate the fact that there are role models here that i can really  
 i don 't know i just need to say that that 's incredible to me and sometimes when i 'm nervous and everything like that i just need to like 
 say some affirmations that can help
  really helps me to get grounded now i can use allende allende allende and you know i just need to say it like it 's so incredible to be here and i knew that we were going to have these questions i was so nervous and i was thinking just like oh my god oh my god  and 
  reminding me because i 've had like some very especially since the last time we were here at ted it was like  unbelievable and then right after
  many crazy things happened like we ended up going to the white house to perform that was like amazing  and i 'm standing there and i was just like please don 't say oh my god don 't say oh my god and i just kept saying it oh my god oh my god 
 and you know i kept thinking to myself like  president obama has to come up here at the same podium  and i 'm standing here saying oh my god it 's like the separation of church and state it 's just i couldn 't like  i couldn 't process it was really 
  too much so i i think i 've lost my way but what i wanted to say is that dating for me  you know as far as i 'm concerned  however you reproduce as long as you 're enjoying yourself and it 's with
  consenting asexual i don 't know  you know where i 'm going with that
 i never been at ted before you know what i 'm saying  i think sarah jones maybe she didn 't want me to come out last time i don 't know why you know what i 'm saying obviously i would be like a perfect fit for
  first of all that i 'm in hip hop you know what i 'm saying i know some of y 'all may be not really as much into the music but the first way y 'all can always
  that i 'm in hip hop is ' cos
 i hold the microphone in an official emcee posture y 'all can see that right there that 's how you hold it all right so you get your little tutorial right there but when sarah jones told me we was gonna come up here i was like betch you know what i 'm saying ted is real fly i got a whole lot of dope
  all getting interrogated and whatnot that 's what i 'm trying to leave behind in new york you know what i 'm saying so anyway  
 i would have to say my top five songs right now is all out of my own personal catalogue you know what
 i mean so if you want to know more about that you know what i 'm saying we could talk about the
  as far as i 'm concerned  you know i believe in creative commons and i think it 's really important that you know  that needs to be sustainable and everything and i mean
 as far as i 'm concerned  i mean this right here this environment i would like to sustain you know what i mean but i 'm
 just saying if y 'all are interested in the top five songs you need to holler at me
  i have to say that i don 't know about how many of my organs have been 3 d printed as such  
 but i can tell you that it is so challenging to me kind of thinking about this concept of the future and
 that you know all
  all around the world parents are kind of
 telling their small children  please you have to eat that you know i have slaved over a hot  3d printer all day so that you can have this meal you know 
 that kind of thing
 and of course now that we have changed you know from the global south there is this total kind of perspective shift that is happening around the
 you can 't just say to them well there are starving children  
  it is the future  nobody is starving anymore thank god  but
 as you can tell i have kind of that optimism
  and i do hope that we can continue to kind of 3d print 
 well let us just say i like to think that even in the future we will have the publication kind of you know 
 all the food that 's fit to print  but everybody please do enjoy that and again i think that you do
 do throw a cracking good party here at ted thank you
  that like as a feminist  
 i like  i really find that like  because i was born in the ' 90s and like
  there were a lot of women who were
 as far as feminism was concerned like maybe they didn 't understand that like a feminist like me like
  don 't think it 's required that you have to have a certain kind of voice  
 or like a certain way of presenting yourself to be feminist because i think that like feminism can be really hot  
 and i think actually that it 's really vital and important  like  the quotation i 'm wearing is from like gloria steinem and like  
  and you don 't have to wear like an eileen fisher caftan just to like  prove that you are a feminist like not
 that there 's anything wrong with that but my mom
  like why do you have to wear pants that like  
 objectify your body  i like my pants  like  i like my voice like she 's
 like  why do you have to talk like talk like what like i 'm expressing myself  and i think that we have to like  reach out  like  not
  a word that i created that means like so strict it 's ridiculous so that 's
  you know what  so
 my name is joseph mancuso first of all i just want to say that i appreciate that ted in general has been a pretty orderly crowd a pretty orderly group
  you know i just have to say the
 whole thing with baldness and you know here 's the thing 
 as long as the woman in my case because it 's a modern world do whatever you want to do i don 't have any problem with anybody  enjoy yourself
 as much as you think they do
 about the you know  i mean i remember hearing this woman  she loved her husband it was the sweetest thing it 's a pretty young girl you know  and this guy 's older  
 and  you know she said she would love him even if he had snow on the roof
 or even if melted and disappeared altogether
  as far as i 'm concerned it 's about the love am i right or am i right  so that 's it that 's it that 's it i don 't got nothing more to say keep your noses clean
  know what to call myself now  because i have really my chinese identity but my kids
  myself in front of audience of people like this but
 if had to give my opinion
 about meat i think first the most important thing is to say
 that we don 't have
  it can also not be poison  maybe we can have some middle ground for that but
 i will continue to consider
 this idea  and i will report back maybe next year
  enjoy that i 'm a member of the blackfeet nation i 'm also half lakota  but that is my given name and
  an activist i 'm also a professional 
 i 'm
 most popular on college and university campuses  you know whenever they want to do a diversity
  do i think there will ever be a post racial world  i think really i can 't talk about race without remembering that it is a construct
 in certain respects  but also that  you know until we redress the wrongs of the
  going to be turned around i don 't care if the present is the new future 
 i think there 's a lot of great people here at ted who are working to address that  so with that  if anything i 've said today makes you feel uncomfortable 
 you 're welcome
  okay well i 'm just gonna answer this really fast as like three or four different people i mean really fast i 'm just gonna let y 'all know that as far as diet is concerned  if you don 't love yourself inside 
 there is no diet on this earth that is going to make your behind small enough for you to feel good  so just stop wasting your time  
 i would just like to say as an african woman that i believe the diet that we need
 is really to remove
 the crazy
 belief
 that there is anything wrong with a nice backside no i am teasing about that 
 there is nothing wrong with a woman of size that is what i am trying to say  women celebrate your body for god 's sake stop running around starving you are making yourselves and
  talking about what 's the most popular diet 
 i 'm gonna start off by telling y 'all that this is my first time here at ted 
 i might
 not be your typical person you  find on this stage my dental work not as nice as some people  
 but i made sarah jones promise she gonna bring me
  this time ' cause she didn 't bring me before  but
 you know i just want to say there 's a lot of things more important than counting calories 
 and as somebody living on the streets in new york  and getting to come here hear y 'all ideas worth spreading 
  i believe in this idea that the present is the new future  that where you sit you create everything that 's gonna come for 
 and for me i think
 homeless is the wrong word for it anyway you know
 i might not have me no place to lay my head at night  but that just makes me houseless 
 i have me a home you do too find it
 and try to find yourself in there make sure you
  know it 's not just about virtual
 reality in space  
 that 's wonderful but it 's also about the actual reality here on earth how are people living today how can you be part of the solution
 thank y 'all for thinking about that right now in the present moment to influence the future i appreciate
