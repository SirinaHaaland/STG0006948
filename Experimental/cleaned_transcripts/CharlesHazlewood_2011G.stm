  am a conductor  
 and i 'm here today to talk to you about trust 
 my job depends upon it there has to be between me and the orchestra an unshakable bond
  born out of mutual respect through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in 
 now in the old days  conducting music making was less about trust and more frankly about coercion 
 up to and around about the second world war conductors were invariably dictators these tyrannical figures who would rehearse not just the orchestra as a whole but individuals within it within an inch of their
  i 'm happy to say now that the world has moved on music has moved on with it we now have a more democratic view and way of making music a two way street i 
 as the conductor have to come to the rehearsal with a cast iron sense of the outer architecture of that music  within which there is then immense personal freedom
 for the members of the orchestra to shine 
 for myself of course  i have to completely trust my body language that 's all i have at the point of sale it 's silent
  gesture i can hardly bark out instructions while we 're playing
  k
  k
  all this to work
  got to be in a position of trust i have to trust the orchestra and even more crucially i have to trust myself think about it when you 're in a position of not trusting  what do you do you
  overcompensate and in my game that means you overgesticulate you end up like some kind of rabid windmill 
  i remember at the beginning of my career again and again on these dismal outings with orchestras i would be going completely insane on the podium trying to engender a small scale crescendo really just a little upsurge in volume  
 bugger me they wouldn 't give it to me  
 i spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms and how futile seemed the words the words of advice to me from
  great british veteran conductor sir colin davis who said conducting charles is like holding a small bird in your hand if you hold it too tightly  you crush it 
 if you hold it too loosely it flies away i have to say in those days i couldn 't really even find the bird 
 now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me in terms of music has been my adventures in south africa the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view but a country
  through its musical culture has taught me one fundamental lesson 
 that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life giving trust 
 back in two thousand i had the opportunity to go to south africa to form a new opera company  so i went out there and i auditioned  mainly in rural township locations right around the country i heard about two thousand singers 
 and pulled together a company of forty of the most jaw droppingly amazing young performers the majority of whom were black but there were a handful
 of white performers  now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period that one of those white performers had in his previous incarnation been a member of the south african police force  
 and in the last years of the old regime he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community 
 now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room the general
  's be under no illusions in south africa  the relationship most devoid of trust is that between a white policeman and the black community  
 so how do we recover from that ladies and gentlemen  simply through singing  we sang  we sang  
 we sang  
 and amazingly new trust grew and indeed friendship blossomed  and that showed me such a
  that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words
 cannot  
 so we got some shows off the ground we started touring them internationally one of them was carmen we then thought we 'd make a movie of carmen which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside cape town called khayelitsha 
  the piece was sung entirely in xhosa which is a beautifully musical language if you don 't know it it 's called u carmen e khayelitsha 
  want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making
  oh
  something which i find utterly
 enchanting about south african music making is that it 's so free  south africans just make music really freely and i think in no small
  that 's due to one fundamental fact they 're not bound to a system of notation they don 't read music  they trust their ears  you can teach a bunch of south africans a tune in about five seconds flat and then as if by magic they will spontaneously improvise
 a load of harmony around that tune because they can now those of us that live in the west if i can use that term  i think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music
  that somehow it 's all about skill and systems therefore it 's the exclusive preserve of
  an elite  talented body 
 and yet ladies and gentlemen  every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis 
 and if i can broaden this out for a second i 'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity with total confidence about movies probably about literature  
 but how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music
  this 
 and what i 'm going to say to you now is i 'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self confidence to take the plunge to believe that you can trust your ears  you 
  can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue fiber dna what makes a great piece of music great 
  on three notes t e d now hang on a minute i know you 're going to say to me t doesn 't exist in music well
 ladies and gentlemen there 's a time honored system which composers have been using for hundreds of years which proves actually that it does  
 if i sing you a musical scale a 
 g and i just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet same
  the same as f in music so t is f so t e d is the same as f e d now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme which is ted have a listen
  or do i smell some doubt in the room okay we 'll play it for you again now and we 're going to highlight we 're going to poke out the t 
  if you 'll pardon the expression
 my goodness me 
  it was loud and clear surely 
  i think we should make this even more explicit ladies and gentlemen it 's nearly time for tea would you reckon you need to sing for your tea i think i think we need to sing for our tea  we 're going to sing those three wonderful notes t e d will you have a go for me audience t e d charles
 hazlewood yeah you sound a bit more like cows really than than human beings shall we try that one again and look if you 're adventurous you go up the octave
  you see now we 're going to put that in the context of the music  the music will start and then at a signal from me  you will sing that
  there 's a project that i 'm initiating at the moment that i 'm very excited about and wanted to share with you because it is all about changing perceptions and indeed building a new level of trust 
 the youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy  which as you can imagine  if you don
  an experience of it yourself is quite a big thing to take on board  but the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me  aside from her very existence 
 is that it 's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden the community of disabled people and i found myself looking at the paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology 
  's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting
 there 's a grimmer side to that truth which is that it 's actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust to really believe that disability and sports 
 can go together in a convincing and interesting fashion  so i find myself asking where is music in all of this 
 so i decided to create a platform for that potential it 's going to be britain 's first ever national disabled orchestra it 's called paraorchestra i 'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had it
 was a really extraordinary moment just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians normally when you improvise
 and i do it all the time around the world there 's this initial period of
  like everyone 's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring an awful pregnant silence 
 then suddenly as if by magic  bang we 're all in there and it 's complete bedlam you can 't hear anything no one 's listening no one 's trusting no one 's
 responding to each other  now in this room with these four disabled musicians within five minutes a rapt listening a rapt response and some really
  i was born without my left hand right hand
  'm making music i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane i become alive
  from playing an instrument and performing
  i only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are paraorchestra is the name of that project if any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point  
 please let me know now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great joseph haydn 
 wonderful austrian composer in the
  half of the 18th century spent the bulk of his life in the employ of prince nikolaus esterhazy along with his orchestra  now this prince loved his music  
 but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time which is just on the 
  place called esterhazy a long way from the big city of vienna now one day in one thousand seven hundred and seventy two the prince decreed that the musicians ' families the orchestral musicians ' families were no longer
 welcome in the castle they weren 't allowed to stay there anymore they had to be returned to vienna as i say an unfeasibly long way away in those days  you can imagine the musicians were disconsolate  
 haydn remonstrated with the prince but to no avail so given the prince loved his music haydn thought he 'd write a symphony to make the point and we 're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now and you 'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen
 i 'm pleased to say the prince did take the tip from the orchestral performance and the musicians were reunited with their families but i think it sums up my talk rather well this that where there is trust there is music by extension life 
 where there is no trust the music quite simply withers away
