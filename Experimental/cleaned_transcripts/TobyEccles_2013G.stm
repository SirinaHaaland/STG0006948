  i 'm here today to talk about social change  not
 a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that but a new business model for social change a new way of tackling the problem 
 in britain
  percent
 of all men who come out of short sentences
 from prison re offend again within a year  
 now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit
 and how many previous times do you think they 've been in prison
  we went to talk to the ministry of justice  and we said to the ministry of justice what 's it worth to you
 if fewer of these guys re offend it 's got to be worth something right i mean there 's prison costs  there 's
 police costs there 's court costs all these things that you 're spending money on to deal with these guys  what 's it worth now of
 we care about the social value social finance the organization i helped set up  cares about social stuff  but
 we wanted to make the economic case  because if we could make the economic case  then the value of doing this would be completely compelling  and if we can agree on both a value
 and a way of measuring whether we 've been successful at reducing that re offending then we can do something
  social impact bond is simply saying if we can get the government to agree that we can create a contract
 where they only pay
 if it worked  so that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn 't work  which for still quite a lot of bits of government
  that 's a serious issue  now many of you may have noticed there 's a problem at this point and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened  
 so
 we have to raise some money  we use the contract
 to raise money from socially motivated investors 
 socially motivated investors there 's an interesting idea  right  
 but actually  there 's a lot of people who if they 're given the chance would love to invest in something that does social good
  and here 's the opportunity do you want to also help government find whether there 's a better economic model 
 not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re offend and putting them back in again  
 but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes
 and fewer victims  so we find some investors  and they pay for a set of services
  and if those services are successful then they improve outcomes  
 and with those measured reductions in re offending government saves money and with those savings they can pay outcomes  
 and the investors do not just get their money back  but they make a return  so in march two thousand and ten we signed the first social impact bond
 with the ministry of justice around peterborough prison
  was to work with three thousand offenders
 split into three cohorts of one thousand each  
 now each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison they 've got to have a year to commit their crimes six months to get through the court system  
 and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer as similar as possible and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of
 10 percent reduction for every conviction event that didn 't happen  so we get paid for crimes saved  now if
 we achieved that 10 percent reduction across all three cohorts then the investors get a seven and a half percent
 annualized return on their investment  and if we do better than that they can get up to thirteen percent annualized return on their investment
  is okay  so
 everyone wins here right the ministry of justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works 
 investors get two opportunities for the first time they can invest in social change 
 also they make a reasonable return and they also know that
 first investors in these kinds of things they 're going to have to believers they 're going to have to care in the
  program  but if this builds a track record over five or ten years  then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product 
 the service providers well for the first time they 've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they 're doing
 in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they 're doing over five or six years not just one or two as often happens at
 fewer crimes fewer victims  
 now the offenders they also benefit instead of just coming out of the prison with forty six pounds in their pocket half of them not knowing where they 're spending their first night out of jail 
 actually  
 someone meets them in prison  learns about their issues  meets them at the gate  takes them through to somewhere to stay  
 connects them to benefits connects them to employment drug
  rehabilitation mental health  whatever 's needed  
 so
 let 's think of another example 
 working with children in care social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people 
 so children in the state care tend to do very badly
  only thirteen percent achieve a reasonable level of five gcses at sixteen  
 against fifty eight percent of the wider population more troublingly twenty seven percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care  
 and even more worryingly  and this is a home office statistic  seventy percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care the state is not a great
  there are great programs for
 adolescents who are on the edge of care and thirty percent of kids going into care are adolescents
 so we set up a program with essex county council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those
 for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system  essex only pays in the event that it 's saving
  investors have put in three point one million pounds that program started last month  others around homelessness in london around
 youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country there are now thirteen social impact bonds in britain  
 and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world so david cameron 's put twenty million pounds
 into a social outcomes fund to support this idea  obama has suggested three
  hundred million dollars in the u s budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward 
 and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest so what 's caused this excitement why is this so different for people 
 well the first piece which we 've talked about is innovation it enables testing of new ideas in a way that 's less difficult
  the second piece it brings is rigor  by working to outcomes people really have to test and bring data
 into the situation that one 's dealing with so taking peterborough as an example  we
 add case management across all of the different organizations that we 're working with so they know what actually has been done with different
  and at the same time they learn from the ministry of justice and we learn because we pushed for the data what actually happens whether they get re arrested or not and we learn and adapt the program accordingly  
 and this leads to the third element which is new  and that 's flexibility  because
 normal contracting for things when you 're spending government money you 're spending our money  tax money  and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control
  exactly how you spend it 
 now any entrepreneur in the in the room knows that version one point zero the business plan is not the one that generally works  
 so when you 're trying to do something like this you need the flexibility to adapt the program 
 and again in peterborough  we started off with a program but we also
  over the period of time  
 we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term  
 greater engagement
 from the prisoners longer term engagement as well  
 the last element is partnership  there is at the moment a stale debate going on very often state 's better  public sector 's better private sector 's better
  social sector 's better for a lot of these programs actually for creating social change we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work  
 and this creates a structure through which they can combine 
 so where does this leave us this leaves us with a way
 that people can invest in social change  we 've met thousands  possibly millions of people who want the
 opportunity to invest in social change  we 've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences 
 with this kind of model we can help bring them together  thank you
