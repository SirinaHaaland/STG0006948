  usually i like working in my shop  but when it 's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river 
 then i just love it and i 'll cut some wood and drill some holes and
 watch the water and maybe i 'll have to walk around and look for washers you have no idea how much time i spend
  this is the double raindrop of all my sculptures it 's the most talkative 
 it adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops
 that land near each other instead of expanding circles  they 're expanding
  all the sculptures move by mechanical means do
 you see how there 's three peaks to the yellow sine wave  
 right here i 'm adding a sine wave with four peaks
  and turning it on
  four hundred aluminum cans  
 tule is a reed that 's native to california and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious
  a single drop of rain increasing amplitude
  the spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip
  adds together four different waves and here i 'm going to pull out the double wavelengths and increase the single 
 the mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about three thousand pulleys
  transferred to a larger scale actually a lot larger with a lot of help fourteen thousand
  is a collaboration with choreographer gideon obarzanek  strings attached to dancers  
 this is very early rehearsal footage but the finished work 's on tour
 and is actually coming through  l a in a couple weeks 
 a pair of helices and forty wooden slats
  take your finger and draw this line
  those stratus clouds that go in parallel stripes across the sky 
 did you know that 's a continuous sheet of cloud that 's dipping in and out of the condensation layer 
 what if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world  
 the earth is neither flat nor round
  it 's wavy 
 it sounds good  
 but i 'll bet you know in your gut that it 's not the whole truth and i 'll tell you why i have a two year old daughter who 's the best thing ever and i 'm
 just going to come out and say it my daughter is not a wave  
  if you took even just the slightest step back the cycles of
 hunger and eating  waking and sleeping laughing and crying would emerge as pattern 
 but i would say if i did that too much would be lost 
 this tension between the need to look deeper
 and the beauty and immediacy of the world where if you even try to look deeper you 've already missed what you 're looking for
  tension is what makes the sculptures move  and for me the path between these two extremes takes the shape of a wave let me show you one more
  evoke so many different images some of them are like the wind and some are like waves and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math is there an actual inspiration behind
  each one are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you
 design it rm well some of them definitely have a direct observation like
 literally two raindrops falling and just watching that pattern is so stunning and then
 just trying to figure out how to make that using
 stuff i like working with my hands there 's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood and trying to make it
 jc and does it ever change do you think you 're designing one thing and then when it 's produced it looks like something else 
 rm the double raindrop i worked on for nine months and when i finally turned it on
 i actually hated it  the very moment i turned it on  
 i hated it it was like a really deep down gut reaction  and i wanted to throw it out 
 and i happened to have a friend who was over and he said
  wait and i waited and
 the next day i liked it a bit better the next day i liked it a bit better and now i really love it and so
 i guess  one the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes  and two it does not look like as expected jc
 the relationship evolves over time well thank you so much that was a gorgeous treat
