  i want to tell you about a pressing social issue  now  it 's not nuclear arms  it 's not immigration and it 's not malaria 
 i 'm here to talk about movies 
 now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
 in film we can be wildly entertained  and we can also be transported through storytelling 
 storytelling is so important  stories tell us what societies value they offer us lessons and they share and preserve our history 
  stories are amazing  
 but stories don 't give everyone the same opportunity to appear within them  
 particularly not stories compartmentalized in the form of american movies 
 in film  interestingly enough females are still erased and marginalized in a lot of our stories  and i learned this for the first time about ten years ago when i did my first study on gender role in
  films since then we 've conducted more than thirty investigations my team is tired 
 and i 've committed my life as researcher and activist to fighting the inclusion crisis in hollywood 
 so today what i 'd like to do is tell you about
  that crisis i want to talk about gender inequality in film i want to tell you how it is perpetuated and then i 'm going to tell you how we 're going to fix it 
 however one caveat before i begin 
 my data are really depressing 
 so i want to apologize in advance because i 'm going to put you all in a really bad mood  but i 'm going to bring it up at the end
  and i 'm going to present a silver lining to fix this mess that we 've been in for a very very long time 
 so let 's start with the gravity of the situation each year my research team examines the top one hundred grossing films in the united states 
 what we do is we look at every speaking or named character on screen 
 now to count in one of my investigations  all a character has to do is say one word this is
  a very low bar 
 thus far we 've looked at eight hundred movies from two thousand and seven to two thousand and fifteen cataloguing every speaking character on screen for gender race ethnicity  lgbt and characters with a disability  
 let 's take a look at really some problematic trends first females are still noticeably absent
  film  across eight hundred movies and thirty five thousand two hundred and five speaking characters less than a third of all roles go to girls and women  less than a third there 
  's been no change from two thousand and seven to two thousand and fifteen and if you compare our results to a small sample of films from one thousand nine hundred and forty six to one thousand nine hundred and fifty five there 's been no change in over a half of a century  over half of a century
 but we 're half of the population 
 now if we look at this data intersectionally which has been a focus of today  the picture becomes even more problematic  
 across the top one hundred films of just last year forty eight films didn 't feature one black or african american speaking character not one seventy films were devoid of asian or asian american speaking characters that were girls or women
 none eighty four films didn 't feature one female character that had a disability and 
 were devoid of lesbian  bisexual or transgender female speaking characters this is not underrepresentation 
 this is erasure  and i call this the
  when we move from
 prevalence to protagonist the story is still problematic out of a hundred films last year only thirty two featured a female lead or colead driving the action 
 only three out of a hundred films featured an underrepresented female driving the story  and only one diverse woman that was forty five years of age or older at the time of theatrical release 
 now let 's look at portrayal
 in addition to the numbers you just saw  females are far more likely to be sexualized in film than their male counterparts  matter of fact they 're about three times as 
  likely to be shown in sexually revealing clothing partially naked  and they 're far more likely to be thin  
 we like to say that these gals have no room for a womb or any other internal organ 
 now  all joking aside theories suggest research confirms exposure to thin ideals and objectifying content can lead to body dissatisfaction internalization of the thin ideal and
  see on screen and what we see in the world they do not match they do not match  matter of fact if we lived in the screen world we would have a population crisis on our hands  
 so as soon as i recognized these patterns i wanted to find out why  and it turns out that there are two drivers to inequality on screen 
 content creator gender and misperceptions of the audience  let 's unpack them really quick
 you want to change any of the patterns i just talked about all you have to do is hire female directors turns out the female directors are associated with in terms of short films and indie indie films more girls and women on screen 
 more stories with women in the center 
 more stories with women forty years of age or
  i think is good news for this crowd more underrepresented sorry 
 sorry but not sorry  more underrepresented characters in terms of race and ethnicity and most importantly  more women working behind the camera in key production roles 
 easy answer to the problems that we just talked about or
  only four point one percent are women only three are african american or black  and only one woman was asian 
 so
 why is it so difficult
 to have female directors if they 're part of the solution  well to answer this question we conducted a study we interviewed
  dozens of industry insiders and asked them about directors  turns out both male and female executives when they think director they think 
 male they perceive the traits of leadership to be masculine in nature 
  lead a ship be a visionary or be general patton all the things that we 've heard
 their thoughts and ideations pull male the perception of director or a leader is inconsistent with the perception of a woman 
 the roles are 
 which is consistent with a lot of research in the psychological arena  
 second factor contributing to inequality on screen is misperceptions of the audience  i don 't need to tell this crowd
  percent of the people that go to the box office and buy tickets are girls and women in this country  right  
 but we 're not perceived to be a viable or financially lucrative target audience  further there 's some misperceptions about whether females can open a film 
 open a film means that if you place a female at the center  it doesn 't have the return on investment that if you place a male at the center of a story does
 this misperception is actually costly  
 right especially in the wake of franchise successes like the hunger games pitch perfect or that small little indie film star wars  the force awakens 
 our own economic analyses show that gender of the lead character doesn 't play a role in economic success in the united states but what does
  production costs alone or in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country it
 's not the gender of the lead character  so
 at this point we should all be sufficiently depressed no change in fifty years few female directors working behind the camera and the entertainment industry does not trust us as an audience
  you there would be a silver lining and there is 
 there are actually simple and tangible solutions to fixing this problem that involve content creators executives and consumers like the individuals in this room 
 let 's talk about a few of them 
 the first is what i call just add five did you know if we looked at the top one hundred films next year and simply added five female speaking characters
 on screen to each of those films it would create a new norm 
 if we were to do this for three contiguous years  we would be at gender parity for the first time in over a half of a century 
 now this approach is advantageous for a variety of reasons one  it doesn 't take away jobs for male
  it doesn 't cost that much three it builds a pipeline for talent and four it humanizes the production process why  because it makes sure that there 's women on set  
 second solution is for a list talent
 a listers as we all know can make demands in their contracts  particularly the ones that work on the biggest hollywood films  what if those
  simply added an equity clause or an inclusion rider into their contract  
 now  what does that mean well you probably don 't know but the typical feature film has about forty to forty five speaking characters in it 
 i would argue that only eight to ten of those characters are actually relevant to the
  the remaining thirty or so roles there 's no reason why those minor roles can 't match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking taking place 
 an equity rider by an a lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we
  there 's no reason why a network a studio or a production company cannot adopt the same contractual language
 in their negotiation processes third solution 
 this would be for the entertainment industry hollywood in particular to adopt
 the rooney rule when it comes to hiring practices around directors now in the
  the rooney rule stipulates that if a team wants to hire a coach from outside the organization what they have to do is interview an underrepresented candidate 
 the exact same principle can apply to hollywood films how 
 well on these top films  executives and agents can can make sure that women and people of color are not only on the consideration
  but they 're actually interviewed for the job now
 one might say 
 why is this important  because it exposes or introduces executives to female directors who otherwise fall prey to exclusionary hiring practices  
 the fourth solution is for consumers like me and you 
 if we want to see more films by for and about women  we have to support them it may mean going to the independent theater chain
  instead of the multiplex 
 or it might mean scrolling down a little further online to find a film by a female director 
 or it may be writing a check and funding a film particularly by a female director from an underrepresented background  right  
 we need to write  call and email companies that are making and distributing films and we need to post on our social media accounts when we want to
  see inclusive representation 
 women on screen and most importantly women behind the camera we need to make our voices heard
 and our dollars count  now  we actually have the ability to change the world on this one 
 the us
 and its content films in particular have captured the
  imaginations of audiences worldwide  worldwide 
 so that means that the film industry has unprecedented access to be able to distribute stories about equality all around the world  
 imagine what would happen if the film industry aligned its values
 with what it shows
  it could foster inclusion and acceptance for girls and women 
 people of color  
 the lgbt community individuals with disabilities and so many more around the world  
 the only thing that the film industry has to do is unleash
  at the beginning of this talk i said that films
 that they can actually transport us  but i would like to argue that films  they can transform us  
 none of us in this room have grown up or experienced a storytelling landscape with fully realized female characters  
 none of us
  because the numbers haven 't changed what would happen if the next generation of audiences
 grew up with a whole different screen reality what would happen well i 'm here to tell you today that it 's not only possible to 
  change what we see on screen but i am impatient for it to get here 
  agree to take action today to eradicate the epidemic of invisibility  
 and let 's agree to take action today to agree that us audiences and global viewers demand and deserve more 
 and let 's agree today
 that the next generation of viewers
 and audiences that
  they deserve to see the stories we were never able to see  thank you
