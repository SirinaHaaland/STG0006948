  in system d  this
 is a store  
 and what i mean by that is that this is a photograph i took in makoko  shantytown in lagos nigeria  it 's built over the
  and there are no streets where there can be stores to shop  and so the store comes to you 
 and in the same community  this is business synergy  
 this is the boat that that lady was paddling around in and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles
 and sells directly to the people who need the boat and the paddles and this is a global business ogandiro smokes fish in makoko in
  and i asked her where does the fish come from 
 and i thought she 'd say oh  you know  up the lagoon somewhere or maybe across africa but you 'll be happy to know she said it came from here it comes from the north sea it
 's caught here  frozen shipped down to lagos smoked and sold for a
 tiny increment of profit on the streets of lagos  and this is a business incubator  this is olusosun dump  the largest garbage dump in lagos
  and two thousand people work here  and i found this out from this fellow  andrew saboru andrew spent sixteen years scavenging materials on the dump  
 earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler  
 which meant he carried a scale and went around and weighed all the materials that people had scavenged from the dump  
 now he 's a scrap dealer that 's his little depot behind him  and he earns twice the nigerian minimum wage 
 this is a shopping mall
  this is oshodi market in lagos  jorge luis borges had a story called the aleph and the aleph is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists and for me this image is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists  
 so what am i talking about when i talk about system d  it 's traditionally called the informal economy the underground economy
  i don 't conceive of it that way i think it 's really important to understand that something like this is totally open  it 's right there for you to find all of this is happening openly  and aboveboard there 's nothing underground about it it
 's our prejudgment that it 's underground 
 i 've pirated the term system d from the former french colonies
  the former french colonies have turned that into system d for the economy of self reliance or the diy economy  
 but governments hate the diy economy  and that 's why i took this picture in two thousand and seven 
 and this is the same market in two thousand and nine and i think when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness they
  't mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone  i think what we have is a pickle problem  i had a friend who worked
 at a pickle factory and the cucumbers would come flying down this conveyer belt and his job was to pick off the ones that didn 't look so good and throw them in the bin labeled relish where they 'd be crushed and mixed with vinegar and
 used for other kinds of profit this is the
  pickle economy we 're all focusing on this is a statistic from earlier this month in the financial times we 're all focusing on the luxury economy  
 it 's worth one point five trillion dollars every year and that 's a vast amount of money right that 's three times the gross domestic product of switzerland  
 so it 's vast  
 but it should come with an asterisk and the asterisk is that it
  excludes two thirds of the workers of the world one point eight billion people around the world work
 in the economy that is unregulated and informal that 's a
 huge number  and what does that mean well it means if it were united in a single
 political system one
  it would be
 worth ten trillion dollars every year  
 and that would make it the second largest economy in the world after the united states 
 and given that projections are that the bulk of economic growth over the next fifteen years will come from emerging economies in the developing world 
 it could easily overtake the united states and become
  the largest economy in the world so the implications of that are vast  because it means that this is where employment is one point eight billion people
 and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive as andrew saboru did 
 big businesses have recognized this and what 's fascinating about this
  slide  it 's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off 
 it 's that the gala sausage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called uac foods that 's active throughout africa and the middle east  
 but the gala sausage roll is not sold in stores
 uac foods has recognized that it won 't sell if
  it 's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers who run around the streets of lagos at bus stations and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack  
 and it 's been sold that way for forty years it
 's a business plan for a corporation  
 and it 's not just in africa 
 here 's mr clean looking amorously at all the other procter & gamble products 
  the statistic always cited is that wal mart is their largest customer  
 and it 's true as one store  wal mart buys fifteen percent thus fifteen percent of procter & gamble 's business is with wal mart 
 but their largest market segment is something that they call high frequency stores which is all these tiny kiosks and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses that exist in
 system d the
  economy  and procter & gamble makes twenty percent of its money
 from that market segment and it 's the only market segment that 's growing  
 so procter & gamble says we don 't care whether a store is incorporated or registered or anything like that we want our products in that store 
 and then there 's mobile phones this is an ad for mtn  which is a south
  african multinational active in about twenty five countries  and when they came into nigeria nigeria is the big dog in africa one in seven africans is a nigerian 
 and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in nigeria  and when mtn came in they wanted to sell the mobile service like i get in the united states or like people get here in
  or in europe
 expensive monthly plans you get a phone you pay overages  you 're
 killed with fees and their plan crashed and burned  and they went back to the drawing board and they retooled  and they came up with another plan we don 't
 sell you the phone we don 't sell you the monthly plan we only sell you airtime  
 and where 's the airtime sold it 's sold at umbrella stands
 all over the streets where people are
  unregistered  unlicensed but mtn makes most of its profits  
 perhaps ninety percent of its profits from selling through system d the informal economy  
 and where do the phones come from  well they come from here  this is in guangzhou china  and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy
  and if you go in there you follow the guys with the muscles who are carrying the boxes  and where are they going they 're going to eddy in lagos  
 now most of the phones there are not second hand at all the name is a misnomer most of them are pirated they have the name brand on them but they 're not manufactured by the
  are there downsides to that well  i guess you know china has no 
 no intellectual property right  versace without the vowels zhuomani instead of armani 
 s guuuci and 
 all around the world this is how products are being distributed so for instance
  you can buy fake designer glasses  you can buy cloned cologne  you can buy pirated dvds of course  you can buy
 new york yankees caps in all sorts of unauthorized patterns  
 you can buy cuecas baratas designer underwear that isn 't really manufactured by a designer 
  businesses tend to complain about this and their they i don 't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it but
 i did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year
 what they thought about piracy  and they told me well you can 't quote me on this because if you quote me on this i have to kill you but
 they use piracy as market research  the sneaker manufacturer
  told me that if
 they find that pumas are being pirated or adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren 't being pirated they know they 've done something wrong 
 so it 's very important to them to track piracy exactly because of this and the people who are buying the pirates are not their customers anyway because their customers want the real deal  
 now there 's another problem this is a real
 street sign in lagos nigeria all of system d really doesn 't pay taxes right  and when i think about that first of all i think that government is a social contract between
 the people and the government and if the government isn 't transparent then the people aren 't going to be transparent either  but also that we 're blaming the little guy who doesn 't pay his taxes and we 're not recognizing that everyone 's fudging things all over the world including some
 extremely respected businesses and i 'll give you one example there was one company that paid four thousand bribes in the first decade of this millennium 
 and
 a million dollars in bribes every business day right all over the world  and that company was the big german electronics giant siemens
  this goes on
 in the formal economy as well as the informal economy so it 's wrong of us to blame and i 'm not singling out siemens i 'm saying everyone does it 
 okay  i just want to end by saying that
 if adam smith had framed out a theory of the flea market
 instead of the free market what would be some of the principles  first  
  define things and what their facts are 
 and third is and i 'm taking this from the great american beat poet allen ginsberg that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency alternate currencies are also very important 
 and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks
