  people love their automobiles they allow us to go where we want to when we want to they 're a form of entertainment  they 're a form of art 
 a pride of ownership  songs are written about cars prince wrote a great
  little red dirt devil he wrote about a car one of my favorites has always been make love to your man in a chevy van because that was my vehicle when i was in college 
 the fact is when we do our market research around the world we see there 's a nearly universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile seven hundred 
  and fifty million people in the world today own a car and you say boy that 's a lot but you know what that 's just twelve
  percent of the population  we really have to ask the question can the world sustain that number of automobiles  and if you look at projections over the next ten to fifteen to twenty years 
 it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of one point one billion vehicles  if you park those end to end and wrap them around the earth 
  progress with automobile technology over the last one hundred years cars are dramatically cleaner dramatically safer more efficient and radically more affordable than they were one hundred years ago  
 but the fact remains
  the fundamental dna of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same if we were to reinvent the automobile today  rather than one hundred years ago  knowing what we know about the issues associated with our
  product and about the technologies that exist today what would we do we wanted something that was really affordable the fuel cell looked great one tenth as many moving parts a
 fuel cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine  and it emits just water  and we wanted to take advantage of moore 's law with electronic controls and software and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected 
  engine the fuel cell and hydrogen as the energy carrier first was autonomy autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head  we embodied all of the key components 
  of a fuel cell propulsion system  we then had autonomy drivable with hy wire and we showed hy wire here at this conference last year hy wire is the world 's first drivable fuel cell  and we have followed up that now with sequel  and sequel
  truly is a real car so if we could run the video
  but the real key question i 'm sure that 's on your mind where is the hydrogen going to come from and secondly
  when are these kinds of cars going to be available so let me talk about hydrogen first the beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources it can come from fossil fuels it can 
  come from any way that you can create electricity including renewables  and it can come from biofuels and that that 's quite exciting the vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen a lot of hydrogen is produced
  in the world it 's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline which i find is somewhat ironic it 's produced in the fertilizer industry it 's produced in the
 chemical manufacturing industry  that hydrogen is being made because there 's a good business reason for its use  but it tells us that we know how to create it we know how to create it 
 we know how to handle it safely  we did an analysis where you would have a station in
  each of the one hundred largest cities in the united states  and located the stations so you 'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time 
 we put one every twenty five miles on the freeway  
 and it turns out that translates into about twelve thousand stations  and at a million dollars each that would be about twelve billion dollars that 's a lot of money 
 but if you built the alaskan pipeline today that 's half of what the alaskan pipeline would cost
 but the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling
  like recharging your laptop or recharging your cell phone so we 're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen we think it 's a question of not
 whether but a question of when what we 've targeted for ourselves and we 're making great progress toward this goal is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells  
 designed and validated 
  with the internal combustion engine we 're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine  and doing it in terms of affordability at scale volumes its performance and its durability  
 so that 's what we 're driving to for two thousand and ten  we haven 't seen anything yet in our development work that says that isn 't possible 
 we actually think the future is going to be event driven so since we can 't predict the future we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future i 'm very very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks
 sit idle ninety percent of the time  they 're parked all around us they 're usually parked within one hundred feet of the people that own them 
 now if you take the power generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the united states it turns out that 
  the power in four percent of the automobiles equals that of the electric grid of the us that 's a huge
  mobile power generating capability  and hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they 're parked to generate electricity for the grid
 we talked about swarm networks earlier talk about the ultimate swarm having all of the processors and all of the cars when they 're sitting idle being part of a global grid
 for computing
  we find that premise quite exciting 
 the automobile becomes then an appliance not in a commodity sense but an appliance mobile power mobile platform for information and computing and communication as well 
  as a form of transportation and the key to all of this is to make it affordable to make it exciting to get it on a pathway where there 's a way to make money doing it 
  people say how do you sleep at night when you 're wrestling with a problem of that magnitude i tell them i sleep like a baby i wake up crying every two hours laughter
 actually the theme of this conference i think has hit on one of the major keys to pull that off and that 's relationships and working together  thank you very much
  one you know i could be wrong about this but my sense is that in the public mind today  gm is not viewed as
 as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your japanese competitors maybe even as as ford are you serious about it and
  when the consumers want it when the regulators force us to do it we will go there will you guys really try and show leadership on this
