  's good for you because you can can have a break after all these fantastic people
 i must tell you i am like that
  very comfortable
 because usually in life i think my job is absolutely useless i mean i feel useless
 now after
 carolyn and all the other guys i feel like shit
 and definitively i don 't know why
 i am here but you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor you arrive at the opera and they push you you must sing
 i don 't know
 so
 so because i have nothing to show
 nothing to say we shall try to speak about something else
  we can start if you want by understanding it 's just to start it 's not interesting but
 how i work when somebody comes to me and ask
 for what i am known i mean yes lemon squeezer
 toilet brush
 toothpick beautiful toilet seats and
  not a toothbrush
 i don 't try to design the toothbrush i don 't try to say
 oh that will be a beautiful object or something like that that doesn 't interest me because there is different types of design
 the one we can call it the cynical design that means the design invented
  who said what is ugly is a bad sale la laideur se vend mal which is terrible it means the design must be just the weapon for 
  marketing for producer to make product more sexy like that they sell more it 's shit it 's obsolete it
 i call that the cynical design after there is
 the narcissistic design it
 fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers
 after there is people like me who try to deserve to exist
 and who are so ashamed to make this useless job who try to do it in
  make the object for the object but for the result for the profit profit for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush
 i don 't think about the toothbrush i think what will be the effect
 of the brush
 in the mouth and to understand
  what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth i must imagine who owns this mouth what is the life of the owner of this mouth
 in what society this guy live
 what civilization creates this society what animal species
 creates this civilization when i arrive and i take one minute i am not so intelligent when i arrive at the level of animal
  species that becomes real interesting me i have strictly no power to change anything but when i come back i can understand why i shall not do it because today
 to not do it it 's more positive than do it
 or how i shall do it
 but to come back where
 i am at the animal
  species there is things to see there is things to see there is the big challenge the big challenge in front of us
 because there is not a human production which exists
 outside of what i call the big image the big image is our story
  our life we must remember and we can see that in any book of my son of ten years old
 that life appears
 four billion years ago around four billion point two voice offstage four point five yes point five ok ok ok
 i 'm a designer that 's all of christmas gifts
 and before there was this soup called soupe primordiale
 this first soup bloop bloop bloop sort of dirty mud no life nothing so then pshoo shoo
 lightning pshoo arrive pshoo shoo makes life bloop bloop and that dies
 some million years
  at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so
 so stupid the most stupid bacteria
 even i think we we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean and something of oh no forget it
 after we become a fish
 after we become a frog
 after we become a monkey after we become what we are today a super monkey and the fun is
 the super monkey we are today is at half of the story
 can you imagine from that stupid bacteria to us with a microphone with a computer with an ipod four billion years
 and
  and we know and especially carolyn that when the sun will implode
 the earth will burn explode i don 't know what and this is scheduled for four four billion years
 yes she said something like that ok that means we are at half
  of the story fantastic
 it 's a beauty can you imagine it 's very symbolic because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today
 and today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years
 and this territory is fantastic that is our poetry
 that is our our beautiful story it 's our romanticism mu ta tion we are mutants
 and if we don 't deeply understand if we don 't integrate that we are mutants
 we completely miss the story
 because every generation thinks we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know i am the man
 the final man you know we mutate during four billion years before but now
 because it 's me we stop fin for the end for the eternity it is one with a red jacket something like that
 i am i am not sure of that because
 because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is
  is obliged to be a genius
 but everybody is obliged to participate
 and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of exercise a
 minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do
 is the duty of
  vision i can explain you i shall try if you walk like that
 it 's ok it 's ok you can walk
 but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole and you will fall and you will die dangerous
 that 's why perhaps you
 try to have this angle of vision ok i can see if i found something up up
 and they continue up up up up i raise the angle of vision
 but it 's still very selfish selfish egoiste yes selfish
 you you you survive it 's ok
 if you
  of your eyes a little more you go i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can i can help you
 i can design for you a new toothbrush new toilet brush something like that i live in society i live in community it 's ok you start to be
  this level
 the more you can raise
 this angle of view the more you will be important for the society the
 more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise
 to to see far and
  like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation
 that means intelligent people are in this angle that is intelligence
 from this to here that it 's genius
 ptolemy eratosthenes einstein things like that nobody 's obliged to be a genius it 's better but nobody
 take care in this
  to be a good mutant there is some danger there is some trap one trap the vertical because at the vertical of us if you look like that ah my
 god there is god ah god god is a trap god is the answer
 when we don 't know the answer that means
  come back because after there is another trap if you look like that you look to the past or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself it 's called schizophrenia and you are dead also
 that 's why every morning now because you
  good mutant you will raise your angle of view
 out more of the horizontal you are an intelligence never forget
 like that like that it 's very very very important
 what
 what what else we can say about that why do that it 's because
 we if we look from far we see our
 line of evolution
 this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth
 like that but if you take a lens
 like that this line is
  ack ack like that it 's made of
 of light and shadow we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria
 and it 's very important to know where we are because some some cycle there is a spot in the cycle and
 you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle
 that means
 we can imagine i don 't say it was fantastic but in the eightys there was not too much war
 like that
 it was we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized
  in this case people like me
 are acceptable we can say it 's luxurious time we have time to think we have time to i don 't know what
 speak about art and things like that it 's ok
 we are in the light but sometimes like today
 we fall we fall so fast so fast to shadow
  with many many many many face of barbaria because it 's not the barbaria
 we have today it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think there is different type of barbaria that 's why we must adapt
 that means that means when barbaria is back
 forget the beautiful chairs forget the beautiful hotel forget design even i 'm sorry to say forget art forget all that there is priority
  there is urgence you must go back to politics you must go back to radicalization i 'm sorry if that
 that even i do it the best possible that 's why i 'm the best
 it 's nothing because it 's not the right time that 's why i say that i say that
 because i repeat
 nothing exist if it 's not in the good reason the reason of our
 beautiful dream of this civilization and because
  we must all work to finish this story because the scenario of this civilization about love progress 
 and things like that it 's ok but there is so many other different other scenarios
  powerful
 intelligent like this idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now
 we are it 's almost done we have just to finish the story
 that is very very important
 and when you don 't understand really what 's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that you
  future
 back back back back back like that and you can fall and it 's very dangerous no you must really understand that
 because we have almost finished i 'll repeat this story and the beauty of this
 in perhaps fifty years sixty years we can finish completely this civilization and offer
 to our
  children
 the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new romanticism with billions of people who have been born worked lived and
 died before us these people who have worked so much we have now bring beautiful things beautiful gifts we know so many
  our children ok
 done that was our story that passed now you have a duty
 invent a new story invent a new poetry the only rule is
 we have not to have any idea about the next story
  and now do it that 's why i continue to work even if it 's for toilet brush
