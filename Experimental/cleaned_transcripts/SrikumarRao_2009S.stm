  in gratitude at the tremendous good fortune that 's been bestowed on you that as you go through the day  you become
 alive several several times  and
 if your life isn 't like that i 'd like to humbly suggest that you 're wasting your life
  life is too short to be wasted so what i propose to do in the next seventeen minutes i 've used up one minute already
 is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started
 on being there is that of interest to you audience yes srikumar
 rao ok  
 this is a conference on happiness  but even if it wasn 't a conference on happiness would it be right if i said that in some way shape fashion or form
  devoting your entire life to being happy  
 everything you do your job  family children relationships whatever is a quest for happiness correct  
 i 'd like you to think about the following  
 what do you have to get
 in order
  just going to spend a minute on this what do you have to get in order to be happy  
 anybody quick 
 when i conduct this experiment a bunch of stuff comes up  vast wealth  trophy spouse good health lots of travel time etc  
  etc etc right now if you were to think about it you probably have a list of here 's what i need to get in order to be happy 
 i would like you to consider
  this anything that you can get
 let me repeat that anything you can get you can un get is that correct  
 so vast wealth can make you happy  vast wealth can disappear tomorrow  a number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already 
 so whatever you get that can make you happy can go away where does that leave you not
 a very nice place right
 i have a different proposition to suggest to you
 what i have to suggest to you is that there is nothing that you have to get do or be in order to be happy  
 let me repeat that there is nothing that you have to get do or be in order to be happy  in fact happiness is your innate nature it is hardwired into you it is part of your dna 
 not be happy  now all of you are very polite  and
 in some of the other forums i speak in such as top business schools they 're not so polite  and invariably somebody articulates what many of you are thinking which is if happiness 
 is my innate nature how come i am not experiencing it  how come i am experiencing my life sucks
  the answer to that is actually very simple 
 you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy 
 let me repeat that you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy  
 and the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model a mental model is a notion
  have that this is the way the world works all of us have mental models we 've got dozens of mental models  we 've got mental models on how to find a job how to get ahead at work how to pick a restaurant to eat at 
 how to have a movie to go to dozens of them the problem isn 't that we have mental models the problem is that we don 't know that we have mental models we think this is the way the world
  and the more we invest in a mental model  the more it appears that this in fact is the way the world works  
 but it isn 't it 's just a mental model  and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something 
  so we can be something like we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places so we can be happy  
 is a variation of the if then model  and the if then model is if this happens  
 then we will be happy
  if i were to get a better job  if i were to get more money  if my boss would have a heart attack  if only i
  i had children if my children would grow up and go to college it
 doesn 't matter what it is the whole notion is if this happens  then i will be happy  
 and right now the only thing that 's different between
 the persons in this audience is what is the particular if that you are focusing on and the only thing that 's different between you now and
  years ago is what is the particular if that you were focusing on think about your life ten years ago spend a minute doing that
 ten years ago if you remember clearly there were certain things you wanted is that correct  
 odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted ten years ago you now
  is that correct where has that left you 
 in exactly the same place right  what we don 't realize is the model itself is flawed the 
 if then model if this happens i will be happy the model itself is flawed  
  i thought if i became ceo it would help but now i realize it 's not that i want to become a ceo i want to become the billionaire ceo  and then i will be happy 
 you 've got your own variation on that  but it 's the model itself that 's flawed not what you put on the if side of the equation  
 i can demonstrate
  any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity 
 maybe a rainbow a mountain range a valley  the sea  and if you remember that raise your hands if you could  
 virtually all of you could right have you ever wondered why that happened 
 the reason that happened is that somehow for some reason
 at that instant 
 you accepted the universe exactly as it was 
 you didn 't say that 's a beautiful rainbow  but it 's kind of off to the left and if i could move it two hundred yards to the right 
 it would be ever so much more beautiful 
 you didn 't say
  that 's a beautiful valley but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches so if you gave me a chainsaw and twenty minutes i 'd make it ever so much better 
 oh no the rainbow off center was just fine the tree with its crooked branches was just fine  
 and the moment you accepted the universe just as it was 
  self dropped away  and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced and you felt it and i know you felt it because now
  even now after all those years you can still remember it  
 the problem is that your life right now with all of the problems that you have
 more precisely all of the problems that you think you have
 is equally perfect but you do not accept it in fact you 're spending all your time striving
  with might and main to make it different you are not accepting it  
 and when you 're not accepting it you 're buying into the if then model if this happens  then i will be happy  and it 's the model itself that is flawed  
 so let me show you how you can get out of that or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that
  i 'd like to share with you that action we all live our lives because we want to achieve something correct you know we are here and we want to have something
 alex wants to have a successful conference you know many of you want to have
 great programs for your companies that are very successful you want to progress have more money all of that is that correct
  you would like something to happen 
 now i 'd like you to think about the following actions are within your control  not entirely but to a large extent 
 the outcome is completely out of your control  
 ok  
 actions are within your control  the outcome is completely outside your control have any of you recognized that when you have a goal and you start to work towards it  some of the time you don 't achieve your goal and
  some of the time what you get is the exact opposite of what you wanted has that happened to any of you  like there was a friend of mine who
 said gee you know i have
 not been paying a lot of attention to my wife and this has to change so the next time we went on a business trip he bought a very expensive dress for her 
 and this was his way of showing you know i care for you and nice things would happen and
  when he presented the gift to his wife her immediate reaction was after twenty years of marriage you don 't know my size 
 and furthermore don 't you know i never wear this kind of thing and the next thing you know 
 marital spat has that happened to any of you you 've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted
 happens all the time well 
 we live in a world where what we think of what we invest in is the outcome  
 we define our life in the following way here i am here is where i want to go these are the steps i have to take in order to get from where i am to where i want to go  and if i
  how we live we invest in the outcome and as i 've just pointed out the outcome is frequently different from what we would like and sometimes the
 diametric opposite of what we would like you invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of
  frustration  angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck 
 there is an alternative  
 and the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome you invest in the process 
 and the best way to describe that is a quote by john wooden  i don 't know how many of you are familiar with john wooden he
  in the united states and certainly among basketball fans  
 he 's the only person ever to make the basketball hall of fame both as a player and as a coach 
 and what he told his entering team he led ucla to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the ncaa
 and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning
  when it 's over and you look in the mirror did you do the best that you were capable of 
 and if you did the best that you were capable of the score doesn 't matter  
 but i would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of you will find the score to your liking 
 that is investing in a process  what we do is the exact opposite we invest in the outcome  this is what i want oh
  i want it so desperately because if i get it i will be happy  and you try with might and main to do whatever you can  
 but you are always focusing on this is the outcome now
 focusing on the outcome is fine it gives you direction  investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement
  and that is a surefire recipe for failure  what you can do is something else you can invest in the process 
 that is once you have determined here is where i am  here is where i want to be  and that 's fine you focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction  
 and then you invest
 invest yourself completely in the process you say here are the steps you want to take and you put everything into it  
 and if you succeed  wonderful  
 and if you don 't succeed  still wonderful  
 because now you have a new starting point and from that new starting point you select another outcome and keep going  
 and when you do that you will find that every day is a blast  let me give you an example and if you have children raise your hands if you have children
 have you ever seen a small child learn to walk  what happens and this happens typically between eleven and thirteen months is the child gets up and
 she sees everybody walking she wants to walk she gets up she falls down  she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her kisses the place makes it well  she tries again falls down mommy runs up again  after some time mommy
 feels tired and no
  longer runs up and the child stops crying and then she gets up takes a step and doesn 't fall down and then she takes another and a beautiful smile comes on her face 
 and very soon generally within twenty four hours she 's walking all over the place upsetting
 your living room arrangements and you know you 've gone to a new stage of parenting  right now imagine what would happen
 if each time the child fell
 she would say 
 oh my god  i failed again  i 'm never going to learn to walk and you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy
  and not being able to achieve and fail yet again how long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that if
  but that is exactly what we 're doing what the child is doing  is focusing on the process she 's investing in the process  
 not in the outcome  
 what we do is the exact opposite as we grow up we lose the ability to invest in the
  we start investing in the outcome  
 by definition the outcome is outside of our control  and if that 's where we spend all of our emotional energy we are going to get drained as we do 
 but if on the other hand we said here is the outcome  i am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit i could 
 every day is a blast and you 're well on your way to achieving the vision that i outlined to you the question that i get all the time
  nothing makes me passionate 
 so i say ok what would 
 and they invariably come up with you know here is a list of things here 's my job and here 's how much it pays this is the kind of person my boss is the kind of people my colleagues are and here 's how my customers 
  are here 's how much i travel here 's how big my office is how deep the carpeting is how many windows i have a bunch of parameters  
  you because all of that stuff first of all it doesn 't exist 
 but second even if it did and you were plugged into it it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry miserable self there as you are now  
 because passion exists inside you  it does not exist in the job  
 and if you don 't find a way to ignite it within you right where you are you
 are not going to find it outside  
 but if you do find a way to ignite it where you are  
 then you will find that the external world rearranges itself
 to accommodate the new person that you are becoming  
 and as you do that you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis persons come up whom you 're delighted to
  meet new people enter your life it 's just a breeze 
 because all you do in your life is you take journeys  you came here to this conference you went on a journey  
 you hang around the water cooler talking about how terrible your place of work is you went on a journey  
 you watch desperate housewives you go on a journey you go on a journey where 40 something women are having affairs with
  the husbands are playing around with models all you do is go on journeys  
 there 's nothing wrong with that but just ask yourself is this a journey i want to take does this take me to a place i want to spend time 
 and if you start doing that  you will find that your life changes  the kind of people you meet  the things you talk about the movies you go to the books you read everything changes
  and you begin all of that by focusing on the process invest in the process  not in the outcome
