  because of
 the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship  and it is and yet it feels natural to us
  first learned that my son had been in the world trade center
 on the morning of september 11th two thousand and one we didn 't know if he had perished yet
 until thirty six hours later  
 at the time 
 we knew that it was political we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of
  my husband orlando and i
 and our family and when i saw it and yet through the shock  the terrible shock  and the terrible
 explosion in our lives  literally
  we were not vengeful  and a couple of weeks later when zacarias moussaoui was indicted
 on six counts of
  conspiracy to commit terrorism  
 and the u s government called for a death penalty for him if convicted my husband and i spoke out
 in opposition to that publicly  through that and through human rights groups we were brought together
  when i saw aicha in the media  coming over
 when her son was indicted  and i thought what a brave woman someday i want to meet that woman when i 'm stronger 
 i was still in deep grief  i knew i didn 't have the strength  
 i knew i would find her someday or we would find each other  
 because when people heard that my son
 was a victim i got immediate sympathy
  but when people learned what her son was accused of she didn 't get that sympathy  but her suffering is equal to mine 
 so we met in november two thousand and two  and aicha will now tell you
 how that came about
  organization of human rights to put me in touch
  and i saw phyllis and i watched her she was the only mother in the group
  and i saw in her eyes that she was a mother just like me  i suffered a lot as a mother
 i was married when i was fourteen  i lost a child when i was fifteen
  know where he is i don 't know if he 's alive i don 't know if he 's tortured i don 't know what happened to him
  so that 's why i decided to tell my story so that my suffering is something positive for other women
  it 's not against women it 's for us for us women for our children
  i talk against violence against terrorism i go to schools to talk to young muslim
 girls so they don 't accept to be married against their will very young
  if i can save one of the young girls and
 avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did well this is something good  
 this is why i 'm here in front of you pr i would like to say that i have learned so much
 from aicha starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members which was a very
  private meeting with security  because it was november two thousand and two  and frankly we were afraid of the
  that time in the country
 those of us
 family members
  but we were all so nervous why does she want to meet us and then she was nervous why did we want to meet her
  what did we want from each other  before we knew each others ' names or anything we had embraced
 and wept then we sat in a circle
 with support with help from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation  and aicha started  and
  i don 't know if my son is guilty or innocent but i want to tell you
 how sorry i am for what happened to your families
  i know what it is to suffer
 and i feel that if there is a crime a person should be tried fairly and punished 
  and what happened then is we all told our stories  and we all connected as human beings by the end of the afternoon it was about three hours
 after lunch
 we 'd felt as if we 'd known each other forever now what i learned from her is a woman not only who could be so generous under
  these present circumstances and what it was then and what was being done to her son  but the life she 's had i never had met someone
 with such a hard life from such a totally different
 culture and environment from my own  and
 i feel that we have
 a special connection which i value very much and
  think it 's all about being afraid of the other but making that step
 and then realizing hey this wasn 't so hard  who else can i meet that i don 't know or that i 'm so different from 
 so aicha  do you have a couple of words
  i wanted to say that we have to try to know other people the other
  and i hope that someday we 'll all live together in peace and respecting each other this is what i wanted to say
