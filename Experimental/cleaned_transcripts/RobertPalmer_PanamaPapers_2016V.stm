  a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of eleven million documents from a panamanian based law firm called mossack fonseca 
 the release of these papers from panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world we get an insight
 into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like 
  mossack fonseca and say ok  we want an anonymous company can you give us one 
 so you actually get to see the emails you get to see the exchanges of messages you get to see the mechanics
 of how this works how this operates  now this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions the prime minister of iceland has resigned
  we 've also had news that an ally of the brutal syrian dictator bashar al assad has also got offshore companies there 's been allegations 
  of a $ two billion money trail that leads back to president vladimir putin of russia
  out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents  now  this sounds like the plot 
 of a spy thriller or a john grisham novel it seems very distant from you me ordinary people why should we care about this 
  the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore
 and not pay the taxes that they should it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare  
 education  roads and that affects
 all of us  now for my organization global witness  this expos
 has been
  we have
 the world 's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets
 something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade  now i think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing and hard to understand how this sort of offshore
  i like to think of it a bit like a russian doll  so you can have one company stacked inside another company stacked inside another company making it almost impossible to really understand
 who is behind these structures 
 it can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities journalists civil society to really understand what 's going on
  i also think it 's interesting that there 's been less coverage of this issue in the united states and that 's perhaps because some prominent us people just haven 't figured in this expos in this scandal  
 now that 's not because there are no rich americans who are stashing their assets offshore 
 it 's just because of the way in which offshore works mossack fonseca has fewer american clients 
 i think if we saw leaks from the cayman
  islands or even from delaware or wyoming or nevada you would see many more cases and examples linking back to americans in fact 
 in a number of us states you need less information you need to provide less information
 to get a company than you do to get a library card that sort of secrecy in
  america has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren it has allowed scammers to rip off
 vulnerable investors  this is the sort of behavior that affects
 all of us  now at global witness  we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice
  how does this actually work  so what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to thirteen manhattan law firms 
 our investigator posed as an african minister who wanted to move suspect funds
 into the united states to buy a house a yacht a jet now
 what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided
 our investigator
 with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds these were all preliminary meetings and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands  
 but it really shows the problem with the system it 's also important
 to not just think about this as individual cases  this is not just
  about an individual lawyer who 's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions it 's not just about a particular senior politician who 's been caught up in a scandal  this is 
  about how a system works that entrenches corruption  tax evasion poverty and instability and in order to tackle this 
  we need to change the game  we need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder  this may seem like doom and gloom
  like there 's nothing we can do about it like nothing has ever changed like there will always be rich and powerful individuals 
 but as a natural optimist  i do see that we are starting to get some change  over the last couple of years
  we 've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership
  this issue was put on the political agenda by the uk prime minister david cameron
 at a big  g8 summit that was held in northern ireland in two thousand and thirteen 
 and since then the european union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across europe  one of the things that is sad is that actually the us is lagging behind
  there 's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the house and the senate but it isn 't making as much progress as we 'd like to see so we 'd really want to see the
 panama leaks this
 huge peek into the offshore world 
 be used as a way of opening up in the us and around the world  for us at global witness  this is a moment for
  we need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies  we need business leaders to stand up and say 
 secrecy like this is not good for business we need political leaders
 to recognize the problem and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy
