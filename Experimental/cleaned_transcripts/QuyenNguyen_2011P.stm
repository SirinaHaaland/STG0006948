  one of the biggest myths in medicine and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved 
 our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single solo inventor who
  who working late in the lab one night  makes an earthshaking discovery  and voila  overnight everything 's changed 
 that 's a very appealing picture  however it 's just not true 
 in fact  medicine today is a team sport  and in many ways it always has
  i 'd like to share with you a story about how i 've experienced this
 very dramatically in my own work 
 i 'm a surgeon and we surgeons have always had this special relationship with light 
 when i make an incision inside a patient 's body it 's dark we need to shine light to see what we 're doing  and this is why traditionally 
  surgeries have always started so early in the morning to take advantage of daylight hours and if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms 
 they have been on top of buildings for example this is the oldest operating room in the western world in london where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in 
 and then this is a picture of one of the
 most famous hospitals in america this is mass general in boston and do you know where the
  room is here it is on the top of the building
 with plenty of windows to let light in 
 so nowadays in the operating room we no longer need to use sunlight  and because we no longer need to use sunlight we have very specialized lights 
 that are made for the operating room  we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights lights that can allow
  us to see what we currently don 't see and this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence  
 so let me back up a little bit when we are in medical school  we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything 's color coded 
 nerves are yellow  arteries are red
  veins are blue 
 that 's so easy anybody could become a surgeon right  
 however when we have a real patient on the table this is the same neck dissection
 not so easy to tell the difference between different structures  
 we heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society what a pressing need it is for us to
 not have one person die every minute
 well if cancer can be caught early enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out  excised with surgery  
 i don 't care if it has this gene or that gene or if it has this protein or that protein it 's in the jar it 's done it 's out  you 're cured of cancer  
 this is how we excise cancers we do our best based upon our training
  and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience  we say  you know what the cancer 's gone we 've made a good job  we 've taken it out  
 that 's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient 's on the table  
 but then
 we actually don 't know that it 's all out  we actually have to take samples
  from the surgical bed what 's left behind in the patient 
 and then send those bits to the pathology lab in the meanwhile the patient 's on the operating room table the nurses anesthesiologist the surgeon all the assistants are waiting around  
 and we wait  the pathologist takes that sample freezes it cuts it looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room and that may be twenty minutes later per piece so if you 've sent three specimens it 's an hour later 
 and very often they say
  say 
 you know what points a and b are okay but point c you still have some residual cancer there please go cut that that piece out so we go back and we do that again  
 and again  and this whole process okay you 're done  we think the entire tumor is out but very often
 several days later the patient 's gone home  we get a phone call
  i 'm sorry  once we looked at the final pathology  once we looked at the final specimen we actually found that there 's a
 couple other spots where the margins are positive there 's still cancer in your patient 
 so now you 're faced with telling your patient first of all that they may need another surgery  or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy
 so wouldn 't it be better if we could really tell if the surgeon could really tell whether or not there 's still cancer on the surgical field
  i mean in many ways the way that we 're doing it we 're still operating in the dark  
 so in two thousand and four  during my surgical residency i had the great fortune to meet
 who went on to win the nobel prize for chemistry in two thousand and eight
  roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with 
 the molecule they had developed had three parts the main part of it is the blue
  and it 's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body  
 so imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer  everything 's going to get lit up nothing will be specific there 's no specificity there 
 so they added two additional components the first one is a polyanionic segment which basically acts as a non stick backing like the back of a sticker  so when those two are together the molecule is neutral
 and nothing
  gets stuck down and the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors for example the kind of protease enzymes
 that tumors make so here in this situation if you make a solution full of this
 three part molecule along with the dye which is shown in green  and you inject it into the vein of someone who
  has cancer  normal tissue can 't cut it the molecule passes through and gets excreted  
 however  in the presence of the tumor now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site  
 and now boom the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent
  so here 's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it can you tell where the tumor is i couldn 't when i was working on this 
 but
 here it is it 's fluorescent now it 's green see so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is  we can tell in the operating room in the field at a molecular level
  where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out  
 and the cool thing about fluorescence is that it 's not only
 bright  it actually can shine through tissue
  the light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue so even if the tumor is not right on the surface you 'll still be
  can see that the tumor is green 
 there 's actually normal muscle on top of it see that and i 'm peeling that muscle away  but even before i peel that muscle away you saw that there was a tumor underneath  
 so that 's the beauty of having a tumor that 's labeled with
  that you can not only see the margins right there on a molecular level but you can see it even if it 's not right on the top even if
  it 's beyond your field of view  and this works for metastatic lymph nodes also  
 sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer melanoma women used to get
 really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes but
 when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment
 protocol
  surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer and then if that node has cancer  the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection
 so what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer  the woman would be saved from having unnecessary
  but sentinel lymph node the way that we do it today is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go so if you 're driving on the freeway and you want to know where 's the next 
  gas station you have a map to tell you that that that gas station is down the road it doesn 't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas  
  it does have gas so that takes more time patients are still on the operating room table  
 anesthesiologists surgeons are waiting around that takes time  
 so with our technology  we can tell right away  
 you see a lot of little roundish bumps there  there some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others 
 who amongst us hasn 't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold  that doesn 't mean that there 's
  well with our technology  the surgeon is able to tell immediately
 which nodes have cancer  
 i won 't go into this very much but our technology  besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence  we can also use the same smart 
 three part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively  the patient has cancer  you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before
  you go in well you can see this on an mri  so
 in surgery  it 's important to know what to cut out  but equally important is to preserve things
 that are important for function 
 so it 's very important to avoid inadvertent injury and what i 'm talking about are nerves nerves if they
  are injured can cause paralysis can cause pain 
 in the setting of prostate cancer  up to sixty percent of men after prostate cancer surgery
 may have urinary incontinence
 and erectile disfunction that 's a lot of people to have a lot of problems and this is even
  which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem  and they are trying to avoid the nerves  but you know what these little nerves are so small in the context of prostate cancer  that they are actually never seen 
 they are traced just by their their known anatomical path along vasculature  and they 're known because somebody has decided
  which means that we 're still learning about where they are 
 crazy to think that we 're having surgery we 're trying to excise cancer we don 't know where the cancer is we 're trying to preserve nerves we can 't see where they are 
 so i said wouldn 't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence 
 and at first this didn 't get a lot of support
  we 've been doing it this way for all these years what 's the problem  we haven 't had that many complications 
 but i went ahead anyway  and roger helped me and he brought his whole team with him  so there 's that teamwork
 thing again  
 and we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves  and when we made a solution of this tagged with the fluorescence and 
  body of a mouse
 their nerves literally glowed you can see where they are here you 're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse  
 and you can see that that big fat portion you can see very easily but in fact at the tip of that where i 'm dissecting now there 's actually very fine arborizations
 that can 't really be seen
  looks like little medusa heads coming out  we have been able to see nerves for facial expression for facial movement for breathing
 every single nerve nerves for urinary function around the prostate we 've been able to see every single nerve 
 when we put these two probes together  so here 's a tumor do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is
  now you do 
 what about the nerve that 's going into this tumor that white portion there is easy to see but what about the part that goes into the tumor do you know where it 's going 
 now you do 
 basically we 've come up with a way to stain tissue and color code the surgical field this was a bit of a breakthrough 
 i think that it 'll change
 the way that we do surgery  we published our results in the proceedings of the
  national academy of sciences and in nature biotechnology we received commentary in discover magazine in the economist  
 and we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues 
 they said wow i have patients who would benefit from this i think that this
 will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications
  needs to happen now is further development of our technology
 along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence
 in the operating room  the eventual goal is that we 'll get this into patients  
 however  we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a
  molecule for one time use  understandably the majority of the medical industry
 is focused on multiple use drugs  such as long term daily medications 
 we are focused on making this technology better we 're focused on
 adding drugs  adding growth factors  killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue
 we know that this can be done and we 're committed to doing it i 'd like to leave you with this final thought  
 successful innovation
 is not a single breakthrough it is not
 a sprint it is not an event for the solo runner 
  a team sport it 's a relay race  it requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted  
 and this takes the long term steady courage of 
 struggle to educate to persuade and to win acceptance  and that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine today
