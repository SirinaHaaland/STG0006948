  that you 're a pig farmer  you live on a small farm in the philippines your animals are your family 's sole source of income
 as long as they 're healthy you know
  one of your pigs can catch the flu the swine flu 
 living in tight quarters one pig coughing and sneezing may soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing until an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm 
 if it 's a bad enough virus the health of your herd may be gone
 in the blink of an eye 
 if you called in a veterinarian he or she would visit your farm and take samples from your pigs  ' noses and mouths  but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those
  samples in their central lab 
 two weeks later you 'd hear back the results  
 two weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread and take away your way of life  
 but it doesn 't have to be that way today  farmers can take those samples themselves they can jump right into the pen and swab their pigs ' noses and mouths with a little filter paper
 place that little filter paper
  in a tiny tube and
 mix it with some chemicals that will extract genetic material from their pigs  ' noses and mouths  and without leaving their farms they
 take a drop of that genetic material and put it into a little analyzer smaller than a shoebox
 program it to detect dna or rna from the swine flu virus and within one hour
 get back the results visualize the results
  this reality is possible because today we 're living in the era of personal dna technology every one of us can actually test dna ourselves 
 dna is the fundamental molecule the carries genetic instructions that help build the living world 
 humans have dna pigs have dna even bacteria and some viruses have dna too the genetic instructions
  encoded in dna inform how our bodies develop  grow function and in many cases that same information can trigger disease 
 your genetic information is strung into a long and twisted molecule the dna double helix that has over three billion letters  beginning to end  
 but the lines that carry meaningful information
 are usually very short a few dozen to several
  thousand letters long so when we 're looking to answer a question based on dna we actually don 't need
 to read all those three billion letters typically 
 that would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover  pausing at every line just to find the nearest pizza joint 
 laughter luckily
  three decades ago  humans started to invent tools that can find any specific line of genetic information these dna machines are wonderful they can find
  any line in dna but once they find it that dna is still tiny  
  out against the rest  until we can visualize it  interpret it read it  understand it  until we can answer  does my pig have the flu 
 or other questions buried in our own dna  am i at risk of cancer  am i of irish descent is that
  to make copies of dna as simple as it sounds has transformed our world scientists use it every day to detect
 and address disease to create innovative medicines to modify foods to assess whether our food is safe to eat or whether it 's contaminated with
  even judges use the output of these machines in court to decide whether someone is
 innocent or guilty based on dna evidence the inventor of this dna copying technique was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 
 but for thirty years the power of genetic analysis has been confined to the ivory tower  or bigwig phd scientist work well
 several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible
 to everyday people like the pig farmer like you 
 i cofounded one of these companies 
 three years ago  together with a fellow biologist and friend of mine zeke alvarez saavedra  we decided to make personal dna machines that anyone could use 
 our goal was to bring dna science to more people in new places
 we started working in our basements we had a simple
  question what could the world look like if
 everyone could analyze dna we were curious as curious as you would have been if i had shown you this picture in one thousand nine hundred and eighty 
 you would have thought wow i can now call my aunt glenda from the car and wish her a happy birthday  i can
  little did you know you would tap on that phone to make dinner reservations for you and aunt glenda to celebrate together with another tap you 'd be ordering her gift and yet one more tap 
  and you 'd be liking auntie glenda on facebook and all of this while sitting on the toilet 
 laughter it is notoriously hard to predict where new technology might take us and the same is true for personal
  dna technology today for example  i could never have imagined that a truffle farmer of all people would use personal dna machines
 dr paul thomas
 grows truffles for a living we see him pictured here  holding the first
 truffle in his hands on one of his
  truffles are this delicacy that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees  and it 's a rare fungus some species may fetch three thousand seven thousand or more dollars per kilogram  
 i learned from paul that the stakes for a truffle farmer can be really high when he sources new truffles to grow on his farms  
 he 's exposed to the threat of knockoffs
 truffles that look and feel like the real thing  but they 're of lower quality
  but even to a trained eye like paul 's even when looked at under a microscope these truffles can pass for authentic  so
 in order to grow the highest quality truffles the ones that chefs all over the world will fight over paul has to use dna analysis 
 isn 't that mind blowing 
 i bet you will never look at that black truffle risotto again without thinking of its genes
 but
 personal dna machines can also save human lives  professor ian goodfellow is a virologist
 at the university of cambridge   last year he traveled to sierra leone when the ebola outbreak
 broke out in western africa he quickly realized that doctors there lacked the basic tools to detect and combat disease
  could take up to a week to come back that 's way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering  
 ian decided to move his lab into makeni sierra leone 
 here we see ian goodfellow moving over ten tons of equipment into a pop up tent
 that he would equip to detect and diagnose the virus and sequence it within
 but here 's a surprise the same equipment that ian could use at his lab in the uk
 to sequence and diagnose ebola 
 just wouldn 't work under these conditions we 're talking thirty five celsius heat and over ninety percent humidity here  
 but instead ian could use personal dna machines small enough to be
  to keep sequencing the virus and keep saving lives this may seem like an extreme place for dna analysis but let 's move on to an even more extreme environment  
 outer space  
 let 's talk about dna analysis in space 
 when astronauts live aboard the international space station they 're orbiting the planet two hundred and fifty miles high  they 're traveling
  at seventeen thousand miles per hour picture that
 you 're seeing fifteen sunsets and sunrises every day you 're also living in microgravity  floating 
 and under these conditions our bodies can do funky things one of these things is that our immune systems get suppressed 
 making astronauts more prone to infection
 girl a high school student from new york
  to the dna of astronauts could be related to this immune suppression  and through a science competition called genes in space anna sophia designed an experiment to test this 
  hypothesis using a personal dna machine aboard the international space station  
  international space station that cloud of smoke is the rocket that brought anna sophia 's experiment to the international space station 
 where three days later  astronaut tim peake
 carried out her experiment
 in microgravity 
 personal dna machines are now aboard the international space station where they can help monitor living conditions and protect the lives of astronauts
 a 
  designing a dna experiment to protect the lives of astronauts may seem like a rarity  
 the mark of a child genius  well to me it signals something bigger 
 that dna technology is finally within the reach of every one of you 
 a few years ago a college student armed with a personal computer
  could code an app an app that is now a social network with more than one billion users 
 could we be moving into a world of one personal dna machine
 in every home 
 i know families who are already living in this reality the daniels family for example set up a dna lab in the basement
  of their suburban chicago home 
 this is not a family made of phd scientists 
 this is a family like any other they just like to spend time together doing fun  creative things by day  brian is an executive at a private equity firm 
 at night and on weekends he experiments with dna alongside his kids  ages seven and nine  as a way to explore the living world 
  last time i called them they were checking out homegrown produce from the backyard garden  
 they were testing tomatoes that they had picked taking the flesh of their skin putting it in a test tube  mixing it with chemicals to extract dna and then using 
  their home dna copier to test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits for the daniels family the personal dna machine is like
  most of us may not yet be diagnosing genetic conditions in our kitchen sinks
 or doing at home paternity testing but we 've definitely reached a point in history where every one of you could actually
 get hands on with dna in your kitchen you could copy paste and analyze dna and extract meaningful information from it and it 's
 at times like this that
  profound transformation is bound to happen moments when a transformative powerful technology that was before limited to a select few in the ivory tower  finally becomes within the reach of every one of us 
 from farmers to schoolchildren  
 think about the moment when phones stopped being plugged into the wall by cords or when computers left the mainframe and entered your
  home or your office  
 the ripples of the personal dna revolution may be hard to predict  but one thing is certain  
 revolutions don 't go backwards and dna technology is already spreading faster than our imagination  so if you 're curious get up close and personal with dna today 
 it is in our dna to be curious
