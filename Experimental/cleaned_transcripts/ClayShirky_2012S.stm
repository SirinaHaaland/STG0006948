  sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in brooklyn a few years ago the store owned one of those machines that can print on plates
  and kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake  
 but unfortunately one of the things kids liked to draw was cartoon characters they liked
 to draw the little mermaid they 'd like to draw a smurf they 'd like to draw micky mouse  
 but it turns out to be illegal to print a child 's drawing of micky mouse onto a plate of sugar 
  copyright violations for children 's birthday cakes was such a hassle
 that the college bakery said you know what we 're getting out of that business 
 if you 're an amateur you don 't have access to our machine anymore  if you want a printed sugar birthday cake  
 you have to use one of our prefab images
 only for professionals so there 's two bills in congress right now one is called sopa  the other is called pipa
  sopa stands for the stop online piracy act it 's from the senate 
 pipa is short for protectip which is itself short for preventing real online threats to economic creativity and theft of intellectual property
 because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands  and what sopa and pipa want to do
 is they want to do this they want to raise the cost
 of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs  
 now the way they propose to do this
 is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills and then they
  now the problem with this model of censorship of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system 
 is that it won 't work  and you 'd think that would be a pretty big problem for
  a law but congress seems not to have let that bother them too much now the reason it won 't work is that you can still type 
 into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you 'll still go to google  
 so the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act 
  now to understand how congress came to write a bill that won 't accomplish its stated goals but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects  
 you have to understand a little bit about the back story and
 the back story is this sopa and pipa as legislation were drafted largely by
 media companies that were founded in the 20th century the 20th century was a great time to be a media company because the thing you really had on your side was
  you were making a tv show it didn 't have to be better than all other tv shows ever made 
 it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same
 time which is a very low threshold of competitive difficulty  which meant that if you fielded average content  
 you got a third of the u s public for free
  of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn 't too terrible this is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink 
 but technology moved on as technology is wont to do and slowly slowly at the end of the 20th century  that scarcity started to get eroded and i don 't mean by digital technology i mean by analog technology  cassette tapes video cassette recorders even the humble
  xerox machine
 created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business because it turned out
 we 're not really couch potatoes we don 't really like to only consume  
 we do like to consume but every time one of these new tools came along it turned out we also like to produce
 and we like to share and this freaked the media businesses out it freaked them out every time jack valenti who was the head lobbyist for the motion
  picture association of america once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to jack the ripper
 and poor  helpless hollywood
 to a woman at home alone  that was the level of rhetoric
  and so the media industries begged insisted demanded that congress do something and congress did something 
 by the early 90s congress passed the law
 that changed everything and that law was called the audio home recording act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety two 
 what the audio home recording act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety two said was look if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends  that is not a crime  
 that 's okay  
 taping and remixing and sharing
  with your friends is okay  if you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them that 's not okay  
 but this taping business  fine let it go 
 and they thought that they clarified the issue because they 'd set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying  
 but that wasn 't what the media businesses wanted they had wanted congress to outlaw copying full stop 
 so when the audio home recording act of
 gave up
 on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear
 that if congress was acting in their framework  they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment 
 so they went for plan b it took them a while to formulate plan b plan b appeared in its first
  something called the digital millennium copyright act it was a complicated piece of legislation a lot of moving parts but the main thrust of the dmca
 was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material
 except that there 's no such things as uncopyable digital material it would be as ed felton once famously said like handing out water that wasn 't wet 
 bits are copyable that 's what computers do that is a side effect of their ordinary operation
  order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits 
 the dmca also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices  
 every dvd player and game player and television and computer you brought home no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it
 could be broken by the content industries  if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you
  content and to make sure you didn 't realize or didn 't enact
 their capabilities as general purpose computing devices they also made it illegal for you to try to reset
 the copyability of that content the dmca marks the moment when the media industries gave up
 on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to
  prevent copying through technical means  
 now the dmca had and is continuing to have a lot of complicated effects but in this one domain limiting sharing it has mostly not worked 
 and the main reason it hasn 't worked is the internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined  
  the fanzine that was nothing compared to what we 're seeing now with the internet 
 we are in a world where most american citizens over the age of twelve share things with each other online 
 we share written things we share images we share audio we share video some of the stuff we share is stuff we 've made  some of the stuff we share is stuff we 've found  some of the stuff we share is stuff we 've made out of what we 've found  and all of it horrifies those industries
  sopa are round two but where the dmca was surgical
 we want to go down into your computer we want to go down into your television set down into your game machine and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store
 pipa and sopa are nuclear
 and they 're saying we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content now the mechanism as i said for doing this
 is you need to take out anybody pointing to those ip addresses you need to take them out of search engines you need to take them out of online directories you need to take them out of user lists  
 and because the biggest producers of content on the internet are not
 google and yahoo they 're
  we 're the people getting policed  because in the end the real threat
 to the enactment of pipa and sopa
 is our ability to share things with one another  so what pipa and sopa risk doing is taking a 
 legal concept  innocent until proven guilty and reversing it guilty until
  can 't share until you show us
 that you 're not sharing something we don 't like 
 suddenly the burden of proof for legal versus illegal falls affirmatively on us and on the services that might be offering us any new capabilities and if it costs
 even a dime
 to police a user that will crush a service with a hundred million users so this is the
  internet they have in mind imagine this sign everywhere except imagine it doesn 't say college bakery  imagine it says youtube
 and facebook
 and twitter  imagine it says ted  because the comments can 't be policed at any acceptable cost 
 the real effects of sopa and pipa
 are going to be different than the proposed effects
  the threat in fact 
 is this inversion of the burden of proof 
 where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we 're given the freedom to create to produce or to share
  and the people who provide those capabilities to us the youtubes the facebooks
  the twitters and teds
 are in the business of having to police us or being on the hook for contributory infringement there 's two things you can do
 to help stop this
 a simple thing
 and a complicated thing an easy thing and a hard thing  the simple thing the easy thing is this if you 're an american citizen  
 call your representative  call your senator 
  what you see is that they have cumulatively received cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media industries 
 you don 't have millions and millions of dollars but
 you can call your representatives  and you can remind them that you vote  and you can ask not to be treated like a thief  and you
 can suggest that you would prefer that the internet not be broken
  and if you 're not an american citizen you can contact american citizens that you know and encourage them to do the
 same because this seems like a national issue but it is not these industries will not be content with breaking
 our internet  if they break it they will break it for everybody that 's the easy thing that 's the simple thing the hard thing is this get ready
  more is coming  
 sopa is simply a reversion of coica which was purposed last year which did not pass and all of this goes back to the failure of the dmca to disallow 
  sharing as a technical means and the dmca goes back to the audio home recording act which horrified those industries  
  that turns out to be really inconvenient we
 'd prefer not to do that says the content industries and what they want is not to have to do that 
 they don 't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing they just want the sharing to go away 
 pipa and sopa are not oddities they 're not anomalies they 're not events  
 they 're the next turn of this particular screw which has been going on twenty
  years now  and if we defeat these as i hope we do more is coming  because until we convince
 congress
 that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright violation was dealt with with napster with youtube 
 which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence and the hashing out of facts
 and the assessment of remedies that goes on in democratic societies
  's the way to handle this in the meantime  the hard thing to do is to be ready  because that 's the real message of pipa  and sopa time warner has called
 and they want us all back on the couch  just consuming not producing not sharing and we should say
