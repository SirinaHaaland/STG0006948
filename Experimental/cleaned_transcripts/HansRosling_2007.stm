  i told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available  
 because of that we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries which is wrong 
 and that animated graphics can make a difference
 things are changing and
 today 
 on the united nations statistic division home page it says  by first of may full access to the databases and
 if i could share the image with you on the screen 
  we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net  so you don 't have to download it any longer  and let me repeat what you saw last year the bubbles are the countries 
 here you have the fertility rate the number of children per woman and there you have the length of life in years this is one thousand nine hundred and fifty those were the industrialized countries those were developing countries at that time there was a
 there was a huge difference in the world  but then it changed  and it it went on quite well and this is what happens
  you can see how china is the red big bubble the blue there is india  and they go over all this i 'm going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how
 how things really changed and it 's africa that stands out as the problem down here doesn 't it large families still
  the hiv epidemic brought down the countries like this this is more or less what we saw last year and this is how it will go on into the future  
 and i will talk on is this possible  because you see now i presented statistics that don 't exist  because this is where we are 
 will it be possible that this will happen
  i cover my lifetime here  you know i expect to live one hundred years  and this is where we are today now could we
 look here instead at the economic situation in the world  and i would like to show that against child
 survival we 'll swap the axis here you have child mortality
  survival four kids dying there two hundred dying there  and this is gdp per capita on this axis  
 and this was two thousand and seven  and if i go back in time  i 've added some historical statistics here we go here we go here we go
 not so much statistics one hundred years ago  some countries still had statistics we are looking down in the archive and when we are down
  there is only austria and sweden that can produce numbers 
 but they were down here  they had one thousand dollars per person per year and they lost one fifth of their kids before their first birthday
  so this is what happens in the world  if we play the entire world how they got slowly richer and richer and they add statistics
  it beautiful when they get statistics you see the importance of that  
 and here  children don 't live longer  the last century one thousand eight hundred and seventy was bad for the kids in europe because most of this statistics is europe  it was only by the turn 
  of the century that more than ninety percent of the children survived their first year  this is india coming up with the first data from india  and this is the united states moving away here 
  earning more money  and we will soon see china coming up in the very far end corner here and it moves up with mao tse tung getting health not getting so rich there he died 
 then deng xiaoping brings money it moves this way over here and the bubbles keep moving up there  and this is what the world looks like today 
 let us have a look at the united states we have a function here i can tell the world
  you are and i take the united states we still want to see the background i put them up like this and now we go backwards  and we can see
 that the united states goes to the right of the mainstream they are on the money side all the time  
 and down in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen the united states was
  a neighbor of india
 present contemporary india and that means
 united states was richer  but lost more kids than india is doing today  proportionally
 and look here compare to the philippines of today  the philippines of today has almost the same economy as the united states during the first world war  but we 
  have to bring united states forward quite a while to find the same health of the united states as we have in the philippines about
  here the health of the united states is the same as the philippines  and this is the drama of this world which many call globalized is that asia  arabic countries latin america 
 are much more ahead in being healthy educated having human resources than they are economically there 's a discrepancy in what 's happening today in the emerging economies
  benefits social progress are going ahead of economical progress and 
 united states had the same economy as chile has today  
 and how long do we have to bring united states to get the same health as chile has today  i think we have to go there we have two thousand
  and one or two thousand and two the united states has the same health as chile chile 's catching up
 within some years chile may have better child survival than the united states this is really a change that you have this lag of more or less
  thirty forty years ' difference on the health and behind the health is the educational level and there 's a lot of infrastructure things and
  we can take away this and i would like to show you the rate of speed the rate of of change how fast they have gone  and we go back to 
 and i want to look at japan  
 and i want to look at sweden and the united states  and i 'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish ford here
 and the red toyota down there  and the brownish volvo
 and here we go here we go the toyota has a very bad start down here you can see
 and the united states ford is going off road there and the volvo is doing quite fine this is the war  the toyota got off track and now the toyota is coming on the healthier side of sweden can you see that and they are
 taking over sweden and they are now healthier than sweden that 's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota
 now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan they really caught up  and this changes gradually  we have to look over generations to understand it 
 and
 let me show you my own sort of family history we made these graphs here  and this is the same thing money
  sweden was like mozambique  and this is when my grandma was born one thousand eight hundred and ninety one she took care of me as a child so i 'm not talking about statistic now now it 's oral history in my family 
 that 's when i believe statistics
 i think it 's the best way of verifying historical statistics sweden was like ghana it 's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub saharan africa
 i told you last year i 'll tell you again my mother was born in egypt  and i who am i i 'm the mexican in the family  and my daughter she was born in chile and the
  was born in singapore now the healthiest country on this earth it bypassed sweden about two to three years ago with better child survival
  but they 're very small you know they 're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests but
 homage to singapore singapore is the best one  now
 this looks also like a very good story but it 's not really that easy that it 's all a good story
 because i have to show you one of the other facilities we can also make the color here represent the variable and what am i choosing here 
  emission metric ton per capita  this is 
  and united states was emitting sixteen tons per person and china was emitting zero point six and india was emitting zero point
  and what happens when we moved on well you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide 
 there is no one who has done it so far  
 and we don 't have all the updated data any longer because this is really hot data today  and there we are two thousand and one 
 and in the discussion i attended
 with global leaders you know many say now the problem is that the emerging economies they are getting out too much carbon dioxide  the minister of the environment of india said well you were the one who caused the problem
 the oecd countries the high income countries they were the ones who caused the climate change 
  we forgive you because you didn 't know it but from now on we count per capita 
 from now on we count per capita  
 and everyone is responsible for the per capita emission this really shows you we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world
 without
 destroying the climate  and this is really what has to be changed  i 've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world but
 i don 't think it 's like this the world is quite a messy place
  place this we can call dollar street everyone lives on this street here what they earn
 here what number they live on is how much they earn per day  this family earns about one dollar per day  we drive up the street here we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day  and we
 drive away here we find the first garden in
  and they earn ten to fifty dollars a day  and how do they live if we look at the bed here we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor this is what poverty 
  line is eighty percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs the food for the day  
  and this is the sofa how it will emerge from there  and the interesting thing when you go around here in the photo panorama you see the family still sitting on the floor there
 although there is a sofa if you watch in the kitchen  you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to ten dollars it comes beyond here  when you really can 
  get good working conditions in in the family and if you really want to see the difference you look
  the toilet over here  this can change  this can change these are all pictures and images from africa  and it can become much better 
 we can get out of poverty 
 my own research has not been in it or anything like this i spent twenty years in interviews with african farmers who were on the verge of famine  
 and this is the result of the farmers needs research the nice thing here is that you can 't see who are the
  researchers in this picture that 's when research functions in poor societies
 you must really live with the people  
 when you 're in poverty
 everything is about survival  it 's about having food 
 and these two young farmers they are girls now because the parents are dead from hiv and aids they discuss with a trained agronomist this is one of the best agronomists in malawi junatambe kumbira
  and he 's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found  
 and they are very very eagerly interested to get advice and that 's to survive in poverty  that 's one context getting out of poverty the women told us one thing get us technology we hate this
  to stand hours and hours get us a mill so that we can mill our flour  then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves 
 technology will bring you out of of poverty  but there 's a need for a market to get away from poverty and this woman is very happy now bringing her products to the market 
 but she 's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count and won 't be cheated when she reaches the market 
 be healthy so she can go to the market and doesn 't have to stay home  and she wants the infrastructure it is nice with a paved road
  it 's also good with credit micro credits gave her the bicycle you know and information will tell her when to go to market with which product  
 you can do this i find my my experience from twenty years of africa is that
 the seemingly impossible is possible  africa has not done bad in fifty years they 've
  with a functioning nation and state i would say that sub saharan africa has done best in the world during the last fifty years  because we don 't consider where they came from it 's this stupid concept 
  of developing countries that puts us argentina and mozambique together fifty years ago and says that mozambique did worse  we have to know a little more about the world  
  temperature and everything i only know two types of wine red and white 
 but my neighbor only knows two types of countries industrialized and developing and i know two hundred i know about the small data
 homage to the office package no 
 what is this what is this what am i telling i 'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development everyone wants your pet thing if you are in the corporate sector you love
 micro credit if you are fighting in a non governmental organization you love
 equity between gender or if you are a teacher you 'll love unesco and so on
  we have to have more than our own thing we need everything all these things are important for development especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare now what
 we need to think about is what is a goal for development  and what are the means for development let me first grade what are the most important means economic growth to me 
 as a public health professor is the most important thing for
 for development because it explains eighty percent of survival  
 governance to have a government which functions that 's what brought california out of the misery of one thousand eight hundred and fifty 
 it was the government that made law function finally  
 education human resources are important health is also important but not that much as
  environment is important human rights is also important but it just gets one cross now what about goals 
 where are we going toward we are not interested in money money is not a goal it 's the best mean but i give it zero as a goal  
 governance well it 's
 fun to vote in a little thing but it 's not a goal and going to school  that 's not a goal  it 's a mean  health i give two points i mean it
  environment is very very crucial there 's nothing for the grandkid if you don 't save up  but where are the important goals of course it 's human rights 
 human rights is the goal but it 's not that strong of a mean for achieving development  and culture culture
 is the most important thing i would say because that 's what brings joy to
  and i 'm going to
