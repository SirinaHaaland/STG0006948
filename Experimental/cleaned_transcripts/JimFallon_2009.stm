  i 've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters dopamine
  things like that all the way through circuit analysis so that 's what i normally do  but then for some reason 
 i got into something else  just recently  and it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers  
 and so this would be the typical talk i would give and the question is how do you end up with a psychopathic killer what i mean by psychopathic killer are these people these types of people 
 and so some of the brains that i 've studied are people you know about when i get the brains i don
  i 'm looking at it 's blind experiments they also gave me normal people  and everything so i 've looked at about seventy of these and what came up was a number of pieces of data  
 so we look at these sorts of things theoretically on the basis of genetics 
 and brain damage  and interaction with environment and exactly how that machine works so we 're interested in exactly where in the brain 
 and what 's the most important part of the brain so
 we 've been looking at this
  interaction of genes  what 's called epigenetic effects 
 brain damage and environment  and how these are tied together 
 and how you end up with a psychopath and a killer depends on exactly when the damage occurs it 's really a very precisely
 timed thing you get different kinds of psychopaths  
 so we 're going along with this  and here 's just to give you the pattern the pattern is that those people every one of them i looked at who was a murderer
 and was a serial killer 
 had damage to their orbital cortex which is right above the eyes the orbits  
 and also the interior part of the temporal lobe so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too they had other sorts of brain damage 
 a key thing is that the major
 violence genes it 's called the
  population some of you have this  and it 's sex linked it 's on the x chromosome  and so in this way you can only get it from your mother  
 and in fact this is probably why mostly men boys are psychopathic killers or are very aggressive  because a
 daughter can get
 one x from the father one x from the mother it 's kind of diluted out  but for a son he can only get the
 x chromosome from his mother so this is how it 's passed from
 from mother to son  and it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development which
 is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed  
 but if you have this gene in utero your brain is bathed in this so your whole brain becomes insensitive to
  so it doesn 't work later on in life 
 and i 'd given this one talk in israel  just this past year  and it does have some consequences theoretically
 what this means is that in order to express this gene in a violent way 
 very early on before puberty you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic not a little stress not being spanked or something but really
  the mirror neuron system works  and so if you have that gene  and you see a lot of violence
 in a certain situation this is the recipe for disaster  absolute disaster  
 and what i think might happen in these areas of the world where we have constant violence you end up having generations of kids
 that are seeing all this violence  and if i was a young girl somewhere in a violent area
  fourteen year old and i want to
 find a mate i 'd find some tough guy right to protect me  well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes  
 and now the boys and the girls get them so i think after several generations  and here is the idea we really have a tinderbox  so that was
 the idea  but then my mother said to me i hear you 've been going around talking about psychopathic killers  and you 're talking as if you come from
  a normal family i said what the hell are you talking about she then
 told me about our own family tree now she blamed this on my father 's side of course this was one of these cases because she has no violence in her background  
 but my father did  well she said there is good news and bad news one of your cousins is ezra cornell founder of cornell university  but the bad
  no it gets worse read this book and here is this killed strangely and it 's this historical book  and the first murder
 of a mother by a son was my
 great great great great great great grandfather okay so that 's the first case of matricide and that book is very interesting because it 's about
 witch trials and how people thought back then  but it doesn 't stop there
 there were seven more men on my father 's side  starting then cornells that were all murderers
 okay  now this
 gives one a little pause 
 because my father himself and my three uncles in world war ii were all conscientious objectors all pussycats  but every once in a while like lizzie
  like three times a century
  the bad news is
