  i was in the hospital for a long time  
 and a few years after i left i went back and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me said dan  i have a fantastic new treatment for you i was
 very excited i walked with him to his office  and he explained to me that when i shave
  i have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is but on the right side of my face i was badly burned so i have no hair and this creates lack of symmetry 
 and what 's the brilliant idea he had  he was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side
 of my face and make me look very symmetric it sounded interesting he asked me to go and shave  let me tell you this was a strange way to shave because i thought about it and
  i realized that the way i was shaving then would be the way i would shave for the rest of my life because i had to keep the
 the width the same when i got back to his office
 i wasn 't really sure  i said can i see some evidence for this so he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots not very informative i
 said what happens when i grow older and my hair becomes white what would happen then
  whiten it out 
 but i was still concerned so i said you know what i 'm not going to do it 
 and then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life this is coming from a jewish guy all right so that means a lot 
 laughter and he said dan what 's wrong with you do you enjoy
  you have some kind of perverted
 pleasure from this 
 do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently none of those happened
 and this was very surprising to me because i 've gone through many treatments there were many treatments i decided not to do and i never got this this guilt trip to this extent  
 but i decided not to have this treatment and i went
  to his deputy and asked him what was going on  where was this guilt trip coming from and he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already  
 and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing now you
 probably think that this guy 's a schmuck right that 's what he seems like  but let me give you a different perspective on the same story 
 a few years ago i was running some of my own experiments in the lab  and when we run
  we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another  so we had one group that i hoped their
 performance would be very high another group that i thought their performance would be very low  and when i got the results that 's what we got i was very happy
 aside from one person there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly and he pulled the whole mean down  destroying my statistical significance of the test 
 so i looked carefully at this guy he was
  anybody else in the sample  and i remembered that the 
  drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash
 and this was the guy fantastic i thought let 's throw him out who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample 
 but a couple of days later we thought about it with my students and we said what would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition what would have happened if he was in the other group 
 would we have thrown him
  out then we probably wouldn 't have looked at the data at all and if we did look at the data we 'd probably have said fantastic what a smart guy who is performing this low because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower giving us even stronger statistical results than we could  
 so we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment  but you know these stories and lots of other experiments that we 've done
  on conflicts of interest  basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me 
 the first one is that in life we encounter many people who in some way or another try to tattoo our faces they just have the incentives that get them to be blinded 
  to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased  and i 'm sure that it 's something that we all recognize and we see that it happens maybe we don 't recognize it every time but we understand that it happens 
  that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives and that 's a much much more difficult lesson to take into account because we don 't see how conflicts of interest
  work on us when i was doing these experiments in my mind i was helping science i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through i wasn 't doing something bad in my mind i was actually
  along  but this was not the case i was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions 
 and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us 
 and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances  
 i do want to leave you with one positive thought
  all very depressing right people have conflicts of interest we don 't see it and so on 
 the positive perspective i think of all of this is that if we do understand when we go wrong if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail we can actually hope to fix things and that i think is the hope
