  what if i could make for you a designer baby what if you as a 
 and i as a scientist decided to go down that road together what if we didn 't what if we thought that 's a bad idea
  but many of our family friends and coworkers
 did make that decision  
 let 's fast forward just fifteen years from now  let 's pretend it 's the year two thousand and thirty  
 and you 're a parent you have your daughter marianne next to you and in two thousand and thirty she is what we call a natural
 because she has no genetic modifications
  and because you and your partner consciously made that decision 
 many in your social circle they kind of look down on you they think you 're like a luddite or a technophobe  
 marianne 's best friend jenna who lives right next door is a very different story  she was born a genetically modified
  and these enhancements were introduced
 using a new genetic modification technology that goes by the funny name crispr you know like something 's crisp this is crispr 
 the scientist that jenna 's parents hired to do this for several million
  into a whole panel of human embryos  
 and then they used genetic testing  and they predicted that that little tiny embryo jenna 's embryo would be the best of the bunch 
 and now jenna is an actual real person she 's sitting sitting on the carpet in your living room
 playing with your daughter marianne  and your families have known each other for years now and it 's become very clear to you
 that jenna is extraordinary  
 she 's incredibly intelligent if you 're honest with yourself she 's smarter than you and she 's five years old 
 she 's beautiful tall  athletic  and the list goes on and on 
 and in fact there 's a whole new generation
 of these gm kids like jenna  and so far it looks
  like
 they 're healthier than their parents ' generation than your generation  and they have lower health care costs  
 they 're immune to a host of health conditions  including hiv aids and genetic diseases  
 it all sounds so great  but you can 't help but have this sort of unsettling feeling a gut feeling that there 's something just not quite
  right about jenna and you 've had the same feeling about other gm kids
 that you 've met  you were also reading in the newspaper earlier this week
 that a study of these children who were born as designer babies indicates they may have some issues like increased aggressiveness
 and narcissism
  but more immediately on your mind is some news that you just got
 from jenna 's family  
 she 's so smart  she 's now going to be going to a special school a different school than your daughter marianne  
 and this is kind of throwing your family into a disarray  
 marianne 's been crying and last night
 when you took her to bed to kiss her goodnight she said daddy will jenna even
  so now as i 've been telling you this imagined two thousand and thirty story  i have a feeling that i may have put some of you into this sci fi frame of reference right you think you 're reading a sci fi book or maybe like in halloween mode of thinking 
 but this is really a possible reality for us just fifteen years from now  
 i 'm a stem cell and genetics researcher
  and i can see this new crispr technology and its potential impact 
 and we may find ourselves in that reality  and a lot will depend on what we decide to do today  
 and if you 're still kind of thinking in sci fi mode  consider that the world of science had a huge shock
 earlier this year  and the public largely doesn 't even know about it  
 researchers in china just a few months ago reported the creation of genetically modified
  human embryos  this was the first time in history  and they did it using this new crispr technology  
 it didn 't work perfectly  but i still think they sort of cracked the door ajar
 on a pandora 's box here  
 and i think some people are going to run with this technology and try to make designer babies now before i go on some of you may hold up your hands and say
  stop paul wait a minute
  that be illegal  you can 't just go off
 and create a designer baby and in fact to some extent you 're right in some countries you couldn 't do that 
 but in many other countries including my country the us there 's actually no law on this so in theory  you could do it 
 and there was another development this year that resonates
  in this area  and that happened not so far from here over in the uk  
 and the uk traditionally has been the strictest country when it comes to human genetic modification  it was illegal there 
 but just a few months ago  they carved out an exception to that rule  they passed a new law
 allowing the creation of genetically modified humans
 with the noble goal of trying to prevent a rare kind of genetic
  disease 
 but still i think in combination these events are pushing us further towards an acceptance of human genetic modification  
 so i 've been talking about this crispr technology what actually is crispr 
 so if you think about the gmos that we 're all more familiar with like gmo tomatoes and wheat
 and things like that
  this technology is similar to the technologies that were used to make those but it 's dramatically better  cheaper and faster  
 so what is it it 's actually like a genetic swiss army knife we can pretend this is a swiss army knife
 with different tools in it and one of the tools is kind of like a magnifying glass or a gps for our dna so it can home in
  on a certain spot  
 and the next tool is like scissors that can cut the dna right in that spot  
 and finally we have a pen where we can literally rewrite the genetic code in that location it 's really that simple  
 and this technology  which came on the scene just three years ago has taken science by storm
  it 's evolving so fast and it 's so freaking exciting to scientists and i admit i 'm fascinated by it and we use it in my own lab  
 that i think someone is going to go that extra step
 and continue the gm human embryo work and maybe make designer babies  
 this is so ubiquitous now  it just came on the scene three years ago  thousands of labs literally have this in hand today  
 and they 're doing important
  research most of them are not interested in designer babies  they 're studying
 human disease and other important elements of science so there 's a lot of good research going on with crispr 
 and the fact that we can now do genetic modifications that used to take years and cost millions of dollars
 in a few weeks for a couple thousand bucks to me as a scientist that 's fantastic but
 again at the same time  it opens the door
 to people going too far and i think for some people the focus is not going to be so much on science that 's not what 's going to be driving them it 's going to be
 ideology or the chase for a profit  and they 're going to go for designer babies  
 so why should we be concerned about this we know from
  darwin  if we go back two centuries  that evolution and genetics profoundly have impacted humanity  who we are today  
 and some think there 's like a social darwinism at work in our world and maybe even a eugenics as well  
 imagine those trends those forces with a
 booster rocket of this crispr technology that is so powerful and so ubiquitous  and in fact we can just go back one century
 to the last century to see the power that eugenics can have 
 so my father peter knoepfler was actually born right here in vienna  he was viennese 
 and he was born here in one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine and when my grandparents had little baby peter the world was very different right it was a different vienna
 the united states was different the world was different there was a eugenics rising 
 and my grandparents realized pretty quickly i think that they were on the wrong side of the eugenics equation 
 and so despite this being their home
 and their whole extended family 's home and this area being their
 family 's home for generations they decided because of
  eugenics that they had to leave  and they survived but they were heartbroken  and i 'm not sure my dad ever
 really got over leaving vienna he left when he was just eight years old
 in one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight 
 so today i see a new eugenics kind of bubbling to the surface  it 's supposed to be
 a kinder gentler  positive eugenics
  different than all that past stuff  but i think even though it 's focused on trying to improve people 
 it could have negative consequences  
 and it really worries me that some of the top proponents of this new eugenics  they think crispr is the ticket to make it happen  
 so i have
  you know eugenics we talk about making better people it 's a tough question what is better
 when we 're talking about a human being but i admit i think maybe a lot of us could
 agree that human beings maybe we could use a little betterment look at our politicians
 here you know back in the us god forbid we go there right now 
  maybe even if we just look in the mirror there might be ways we think
 we could be better i might wish honestly that i had more hair here  instead of baldness 
 some people might wish they were taller have a different weight a different face 
 if we could do those things we could make those things happen or we could make them happen in our children it would be very seductive  
 and yet coming with it would be these risks i talked about eugenics  but there would be risks to
  individuals as well  
 so if we forget about enhancing people and we just try to make them healthier using genetic modification this technology is so new
 and so powerful that by accident we could make them sicker  that easily could happen  and there 's another risk and that
  all of the legitimate important genetic modification research going on just in the lab again no interest in designer babies
 a few people going the designer baby route  things go badly  that entire field
 could be damaged  i also think it 's not that unlikely
 that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification  so for example our imagined
 gm jenna child who
  is healthier if there 's a generation that looks like they have lower health care costs it 's possible that governments may start trying to compel their citizens
 to go the gm route  look at china 's one child policy  it 's thought that
 that prevented the birth of four hundred million human beings  
  so it 's not beyond the realm of possible that genetic modification could be something that governments push  
 and if designer babies become popular  in our digital age
 viral videos social media
 what if designer babies are thought to be fashionable  and they kind of become the new glitterati the new kardashians or something 
 you know  are those trends that we really could control
 i 'm not convinced that we could
 so again today it 's halloween and when we talk about genetic modification there 's one
  halloween associated character
 that is talked about or invoked more than anything else and that is frankenstein 
 mostly that 's been frankenfoods and all this other stuff  but if we  if we
  about this now and we think about it in the human context on a day like halloween if parents can
 in essence costume their children genetically  are we going to be talking about a frankenstein two point zero kind of situation  
 i don 't think so i don 't think it 's going to get to that extreme but when we are going about hacking the human code 
 i think all bets are off in terms of what might come of that there would still be dangers 
  can look in the past to other elements of transformative science and see how they can basically go out of control and permeate society 
 so i 'll just give you one example and that is in vitro fertilization
 almost exactly forty years ago  test tube baby number one louise
 brown was born  and that 's a great thing and i think
 since then five million ivf babies have been born  bringing immeasurable happiness a lot of parents now can love
 those kids  but if you think about it in four decades five million babies being born from a new technology is pretty remarkable  
 and the same kind of thing could happen
 with human genetic modification and designer babies  so depending on the decisions we make in the next few
  months the next year or so if designer baby number one is born within a few decades there could well be millions of genetically modified humans  
 and there 's a difference there too because if we 
 you in the audience or i if we decide to have a designer baby 
 then their children will also be genetically modified and so on because it 's heritable so that 's a big difference
  so with all of this in mind what should we do 
 there 's actually going to be a meeting a month from tomorrow in washington d c 
 by the us national academy of sciences to tackle that exact question 
 what is the right path forward with human genetic modification  
 i believe at this time
 we need a moratorium we have to ban this we should not
  allow creating genetically modified people because it 's just too dangerous and too unpredictable  
 but there 's a lot of people thanks 
 and let me say just as a scientist 
 it 's a little bit scary for me to say that in public because
 science generally
  and things like that 
 so i think we need to put a hold on this  but there are many people who not only disagree with me they feel the exact opposite they 're like step on the gas  full speed ahead let 's make designer babies  and so
 in the meeting in december and other meetings that are likely to follow in the next few months  it 's very possible there may be no
  moratorium  and i think part of the problem that we have
 is that all of this trend this revolution in genetic modification applying to humans the public hasn 't known about it nobody has been
 saying  look  this
 is a big deal this is a revolution  and this could affect you in very personal
  and so part of my goal is actually to change that and to educate and engage with the public and get you guys talking about this  
 and so i hope at these meetings that there will be a role for for the public to bring their voice to bear as well  
 so if we kind of circle back now to two thousand and thirty again that imagined story  and depending on the decisions we
  literally we don 't have a lot of time in the next few months the next year or so because this technology is spreading like wildfire 
 let 's pretend we 're back in that reality we 're at a park and
 our kid is swinging on the swing 
 is that kid a regular old kid or did we decide to have a designer baby  
 and let 's say we we went the sort of traditional route  and there 's our kid swinging on the swing and
 frankly  they 're kind of a mess  their hair is all over the place like mine 
 they have a stuffy nose  they 're not the best student in the world
  they 're adorable you love them  but there on the swing next to them their best friend
 is a gm kid  and the two of them are kind of swinging like this and you can
  help but compare them right and the gm kid is swinging higher they look better they 're a better student  they don 't have that stuffy nose you need to wipe
 how is that going to make you feel and what decision might you make next time
