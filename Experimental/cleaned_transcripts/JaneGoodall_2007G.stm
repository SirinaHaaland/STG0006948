  but we can also
  the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening you hear it going from one side of the valley to the other from one group of nests to the next  
 and i want to pick up with my talk this evening from where
 from where zeray left off yesterday he was talking about this amazing
 three year old australopithecine child
 and we 've also been hearing about the history the family tree of mankind through dna genetic profiling  
 and
 it was a paleontologist  the late louis leakey  who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees and it was pretty
  extraordinary way back then it 's kind of commonplace now but his argument was
 because he 'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans
 in africa  and you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils from the shape of the muscle attachments
  something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them but what about how they behaved 
 that 's what he wanted to know  and of course behavior doesn 't fossilize 
 he argued and it 's now a fairly common theory that if we found
 behavior patterns similar or the same
 in our closest living relatives  the great apes and humans today  then maybe those behaviors were present in the
  ancestor some seven million years ago  and therefore perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient ancient past 
 well if you look in
 textbooks today that deal with human evolution you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved
  based on the behavior of chimpanzees  
 they are more like us than any other living creature and we 've heard about that during this ted conference  
 so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us in certain aspects of their behavior 
 every chimpanzee has his or her own personality of course i gave
  they can live to be sixty years or more although we think most of them probably don 't make it to sixty in the wild mr wurzel  
 the female has her first baby when she 's eleven or twelve 
 thereafter she has one baby only every five or six years a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing sleeping with the mother at night 
  we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees just as it is for us in relation to learning 
 as the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals  so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual 's life history  
 and young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do we know now that they 're capable of imitating
  behaviors that they see 
 and we believe that it 's in this way that the different tool using behaviors that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in africa
 how these are passed from one generation to the next through observation imitation and practice  so that we can describe these
  as primitive culture chimpanzees don 't have a spoken language we 've talked about that they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures many of 
  which are similar or even identical to ours and formed in the same context greeting chimpanzees embracing they also kiss  hold hands pat one another on the back  and they swagger and they throw rocks
  chimpanzee society we find
 many many examples of compassion  precursors to love and true altruism  
 unfortunately they like us have a dark side to their nature they 're capable of extreme brutality even a kind of primitive war  
 and these really aggressive behaviors for the most part are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group they are very territorially
  aggressive 
 chimpanzees i believe more than any other living creature have helped us to understand that after all there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of 
  the animal kingdom  it 's a very blurry line and it 's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations  the study that i
  is still continuing to this day  
 and these chimpanzees living their complex social lives in the wild 
 have helped more than anything else to make us realize we are part of and not separated from the amazing animals with whom we share the planet  
 so it 's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees like so many other creatures around the world  are
  losing their habitats this is just one photograph from the air and it shows you the forested highlands of gombe and it was when i flew over the whole area 
 about sixteen years ago  and realized that outside the park this forest which in one thousand nine hundred and sixty had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of lake tanganyika which is where the tiny
  national park lies 
 that a question came to my mind 
 how can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees when the people living around the national park are struggling to survive more people are living 
  there than the land could possibly support the numbers increased by refugees pouring in from burundi and over the lake from congo 
  food from elsewhere this led to a program  which we call tacare
  it 's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park it started small with twelve villages  it 's now 
 there isn 't time to go into it but it 's including things like tree nurseries methods of farming most suitable to this now very
  degraded almost desert like land up in these mountains  
 ways of controlling preventing soil erosion  ways of reclaiming overused farmland so that within two years they can again be productive 
 working to
 help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells  
  some schoolrooms most important of all i believe is working with small groups of women  providing them with opportunities for 
 loans  and we 've got as is the case around the world  about ninety five percent of all loans returned 
 empowering women  working
  providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school in the
 clear understanding that all around the world  as women 's education improves family size drops 
 we provide information about family planning and about hiv  aids  and
 as a result of this program  something 's happening for conservation what 's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these
 villages instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys
 and by the way many of the staff are now tanzanian
 but when we began the tacare program  it was a tanzanian team going into the villages it was a tanzanian team talking to the
  asking what they were interested in were they interested in conservation absolutely not they were interested in health they were interested in education  and as
 time went on  and as their situation began to improve  
 they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation they began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees
  so you 've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides 
 today  we are developing what we call the greater gombe ecosystem this is an area way outside the national park  stretching out into 
  all these very degraded lands  and as these villages have a better standard of life they are actually agreeing to put between ten percent and twenty percent of their land
  so that once again 
 as the trees grow back  the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact as they must for genetic viability with other remnant groups outside the national park  
 so
 tacare is a success we 're replicating it in other parts of africa around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure
  the
 problems in africa however as we 've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of ted are major problems
 there is a great deal of poverty 
 and when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that
  particularly when you cut down trees  and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion 
 as desperate populations cut down more and more trees  so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families  
 what 's going to happen  something 's got to give  and
 the other problems in not only africa  but the rest of the developing world and indeed everywhere what are we doing to our
  planet 
 you know the famous scientist e o wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average european 
  or american  we need three new planets today they are saying four but we don 't have them 
  what 's happened i mean the question here is 
 here we are arguably the most intelligent being that 's ever walked planet earth with this extraordinary
 brain  capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these ted conferences  
 and yet we 're destroying the only home we have 
 the indigenous people around the world before they made a major decision used to sit around and ask
  themselves how does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead 
 today  major decisions and i 'm not particularly talking about africa here but the developed world major decisions involving millions of dollars and millions 
  of people are often based on how will this affect the next shareholders ' meeting and these decisions affect africa 
  the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests 
 i realized more and more how so many of africa 's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation  
 so i began traveling outside africa talking in europe talking in the united states going to asia 
 and everywhere there were these terrible problems and you know the kind i 'm talking about i 'm talking about pollution
 air that we breathe that often
 poisons us the earth is poisoning our foods  the water water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we 're going to face in this century 
 and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world  seemingly with the inability to profit from past
  experience  the
 mangroves are being cut down the effects of things like the tsunami get worse we 've talked about the soil erosion  
 we have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses so called leading to climate change  finally 
 all around the world people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate
 all around the world climates are mixed up  
 and it 's the poor people who are affected worse  it 's africa that already is affected in many parts of sub saharan africa  the droughts are so much 
  worse and when the rain does come it so often leads to flooding and added distress  and
 numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support  who are too poor to buy food who can 't move away because the whole land is degraded 
 and so you get
 desertification creeping creeping creeping as the last of the trees are cut down and this kind of thing is not just in
  it 's all over the world  so
 it wasn 't surprising to me
 that as i was traveling around the world i met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope  
 we seem to have lost wisdom the wisdom of the indigenous people 
 i asked a question why well  do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain
  kind of brain that that the ted technologies exemplify  and the human heart talking about it in the non scientific term
 in terms of love and compassion is there some disconnect  and
 these young people when i talk to them basically they they were either depressed or apathetic or bitter and angry  and they said more or less the same thing
  feel this way because we feel you 've compromised our future and there 's nothing we can do about it 
 we have compromised their future 
 i 've got three little grandchildren  and every time i look at them and i think how we 've harmed this beautiful planet since i was their age i feel this desperation  
 and that led to this program we call
  roots and shoots which began right here in tanzania
 and has now spread to ninety seven countries around the world  it 's symbolic roots make a firm foundation shoots seem tiny to reach the sun they can 
  break through a brick wall see the brick wall as all these problems we 've inflicted on the planet environmental and social  
 the most important message of roots and shoots  every single one of us makes a difference every single day  we have a choice 
 every one of us in this room we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make 
 the very poor have no choice  it 's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well
  the roots and shoots groups all choose three projects it
 depends on how old they are and which country  whether they 're in a city or rural as to what kinds of projects but basically we have programs now from preschool right through university with more and more adults
 starting their own
 roots and shoots groups and every group chooses between them three different
  kinds of project to make this a better world  recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other so one of their projects will 
  be to help their own human community  and then if they 're able they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world  
  projects will be to help the environment that we all share and woven throughout all of this is
 a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves in our families in our communities between nations between cultures between religions and between us and the natural
  we need the natural world  we cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are we not do have more than this one planet 
 just picking one or two of the projects right here in africa that the roots and shoots groups are doing one or two projects only
 in tanzania in uganda kenya south africa congo brazzaville sierra leone cameroon and other groups  and as i say
 of course they 're planting trees they 're growing organic vegetables they 're working in the refugee camps with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money  or just using them to feed their families  
 and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment because they 're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens  it
  doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves once again they 're useful members of society  we have this program in prisons as well  
 so there 's no time for more roots and shoots now but
 oh they 're also working on hiv  aids that 's a very important component of roots and shoots with older kids talking to younger ones  and unwanted pregnancies
  and things like that which young people listen to
 better from other youth rather than adults 
 hope that 's the question i get asked as i 'm going around the world jane you 've seen so many terrible things you 've seen your chimpanzees
 decrease in number from about one million at the turn of the century to
  more than one hundred and fifty thousand now and the same with so many other animals forests disappearing deserts where once there was forest 
 do you really have hope 
 well  yes you can 't come to a conference like ted and not have hope can you
  and of course there 's hope one is this amazing human brain  
 and i mean think of the technologies and i 've just been so thrilled finally to come to people talking about
 compost latrines it 's one of my
  hobbyhorses we just flush all this water down the lavatory it 's terrible and then talking about
 renewable energy desperately important 
 do we care about the planet for our children how many of us have children or grandchildren  nieces nephews do we care about their future and if we care about their
  the elite around the world  we can do something about it we can make choices as to how we live each day  what we buy what we wear  and
 choose
 to make these choices with the question how will this affect the environment around me how will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up or my grandchild or whatever it is 
 so the human brain coupled with the human heart
  and we join hands around the world and that 's what ted is helping so well with and google who help us and
 are helping us with mapping in gombe national park all of these technologies we can use now let 's link them and it 's beginning to happen isn 't it you 've heard about it this afternoon it 's beginning to happen this change
  see change that we must have if we care about the future 
 and the next reason for hope nature is amazingly resilient you can take an area that 's absolutely destroyed with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate 
  and an example is the tacare program i told you where a seemingly dead tree stump if you stop hacking them for firewood  which you don 't need to because you have wood lots then in five years you can have
  almost on the brink of extinction can be given a second chance that 's my next book  it 's inspiring  
 and it brings me to my last category of hope  and we 've heard about this so much in the last two days this indomitable human spirit 
 this determination of people the resilience of the human spirit  
 so that people who you would think would be battered by poverty or disease or whatever can
 pull themselves up out of it sometimes with a helping hand  and
 take their part in society  and take their part in changing the world 
 and just to think of one or two people out of africa who are just really inspiring we could make a very long list but obviously nelson mandela  emerging from seventeen years of hard physical labor twenty three years of imprisonment with this amazing
  ability to forgive  so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath
 in nigeria who took on the giant oil companies  and although people around the world tried their best was executed
 people like this are so inspirational people like this are the role models we need for young africans
  and we need some environmental role models as well  and i 've been hearing some of them today  
 so i 'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again with everyone at ted and i hope that some of us can
 get together and talk about some of these things especially the roots and shoots program
  and just a last word on that the young woman who 's running this entire conference center 
 i met her today  she came up so excited with her certificate she was [ in ] roots and shoots she was in the leadership in dar es salaam she said it 's helped her to do what she 
  's doing  and it was very very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people when they are empowered
