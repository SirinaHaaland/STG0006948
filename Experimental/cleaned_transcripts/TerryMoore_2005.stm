  of the ted audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective intelligent intellectual
  savvy  worldly and innovative people in the world and i think that 's true  however i
 i also have reason to believe that many if not most of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly now
 i know that seems ludicrous  i know that seems ludicrous  and believe me  i lived the same sad life until about three years ago  
 and what happened to me was i bought  what was for me a very expensive pair of shoes but those shoes came with round nylon laces and i couldn 't keep them tied 
 so i went back to the store and said to the owner i love the shoes but i hate the laces
  a look and said oh you 're tying them wrong 
 now up until that moment  i would have thought that by age fifty 
 one of the life skills that i had really nailed was tying my shoes 
 but not so let me demonstrate
  this is the way
 that most of us were taught to tie our shoes
  as it turns out thank you 
 wait there 's more as it turns out 
 there 's a strong form and a weak form of this knot and we were taught the weak form and here 's how to tell  
 if you pull the strands at the base of the knot  you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe
  that 's the weak form of the knot  but not to worry  if we start over
 and
 simply go the other direction around the bow 
 we get this the strong form of the knot  and if you pull the cords under the knot you will see that
 the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe  
 this is a stronger knot it will come untied less often it will let you down less and not only that it looks better we
  do this one more time 
 start as usual 
 go the other way around the loop this is a little hard for children but i think you can handle it 
 pull the knot there it is the strong form of the shoe knot now 
 in keeping with today 's theme
