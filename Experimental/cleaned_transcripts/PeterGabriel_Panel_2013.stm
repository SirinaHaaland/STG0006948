  may think you 're looking through a window at a dolphin
 spinning playfully but what you 're actually looking through is a two way mirror at a dolphin looking at itself
  spinning playfully
 this is a dolphin that is self aware this dolphin has self awareness it 's a young dolphin named bayley
 i 've been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphins for the past thirty years how do we explore intelligence in this animal that 's so 
  different from us and what i 've used is a very simple research tool a mirror and we 've gained great information reflections of these animal minds
  only non human animals to show mirror self recognition we used to think this was a uniquely human ability but we learned that the great apes our closest relatives also show this ability
 then we showed it in dolphins and then later in elephants we did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants and it 's been recently shown in the magpie
  now it 's interesting because we 've embraced this darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution this physical continuity
 but we 've been much more reticent much slower at recognizing
 this continuity in cognition in emotion in consciousness in other animals
 other animals are conscious they 're emotional
 they 're aware there have been multitudes of studies with many species over the years that have given us exquisite
  evidence for thinking and consciousness in other animals other animals that are quite different than we are in form we are not alone
 we are not alone in these abilities
 and i hope and one of my biggest dreams is that with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world
  that we 'll give them the respect and protection that they deserve so that 's a wish i 'm throwing out here for everybody and i hope i can really engage you in this idea
 now i want to return to dolphins because these are the animals that i i feel like i 've been working up
 closely and personal with for over thirty years and these are real personalities they are
  not persons but they 're personalities in every sense of the word and you can 't get more alien than the dolphin
 they are very different from us in body form they 're radically different they come from a radically different environment
 in fact we 're separated by ninety five million years of divergent evolution
 look at this body and in every sense of making a pun here these are true non terrestrials
 i wondered
 how we might interface with these animals in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s i developed an underwater keyboard this was a custom made touch screen keyboard what i wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control these are big brains highly social animals
 and i thought well if we give them choice and control if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard and by the way it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from hewlett packard
 with an apple ii computer this seems
  prehistoric now but this was where we were with technology
 so the dolphins could hit a key a symbol they heard a computer generated whistle and they got an object or activity now here 's a little video this is delphi and pan 
 and you 're going to see delphi hitting a key he hears a computer generated whistle whistle
  keyboard
 on their own there was no intervention on our part they explored the keyboard they played around with it they figured out how it worked
 and they started to quickly imitate the sounds 
 they were hearing on the keyboard they imitated on their own beyond that though they started learning associations between the symbols
  and the objects
 what we saw was self organized learning and now i 'm imagining what can we do with new technologies how can we create interfaces 
 new windows into the minds of animals with the technologies that exist today
  for a living on a good day it 's music and i want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music making experience i ever had
 i 'm a farm boy i grew up surrounded by animals and i would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there
 so as an adult when i started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with penny patterson and koko with sue savage rumbaugh and kanzi panbanisha irene pepperberg
  alex the parrot i got all excited
 what was amazing to me also was
 they seemed a lot more adept
 at getting a handle on our language than we were on getting a handle on theirs
 i work with a lot of musicians from around the world and often we don 't have any common language at all but we sit down
 behind our instruments and suddenly there 's a way for us to connect and emote so i started cold calling and eventually got through to sue savage rumbaugh
 and she invited me down i went down and
 the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments musical toys but never before to a keyboard
 at first they did what infants do just
  it with their fists and then i asked through sue if panbanisha could try with one finger only
  groom was the subject of the
  sue 's encouraging her to continue
  in
 that 
 we began to dream
 and we thought perhaps the most amazing tool that man 's created is the internet and what would happen
 if we could somehow find new interfaces visual audio interfaces that would allow
 these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access and
 sue savage rumbaugh got excited about that
 called her friend steve woodruff and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring
 which led us to diana
 and led us to neil applause ng
 so peter approached me i lost it when i saw that clip he approached
  with a vision of doing these things not for people for animals and then i was struck in the history of the internet this is what the internet looked like when it was born 
 and you can call that the internet of middle aged white men mostly middle aged
  ted which was where i met peter i showed this this is a dollar one web server and at the time that was radical
 and the possibility of making a web server for a dollar
 grew into what became known as the internet of things which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care energy efficiency and we were happy with ourselves and then when peter showed me that i realized we had missed something which is
 the rest of the planet
 so we started up this interspecies internet project now we started talking with ted about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to ted and we realized that wouldn 't work
 so we 're going to bring you to them so if we could switch to the audio from this computer
 we 've been video conferencing with cognitive animals and we 're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them and so if we could also have this up great so the
  first site we 're going to meet is cameron park zoo in waco with orangutans in the daytime they live outside it 's nighttime there now so can you please go ahead
  enrich the animals and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals and
  share ninety seven percent of our dna and are incredibly intelligent so it 's so exciting 
  we have via technology and the internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world we 're really excited about the possibility of an
 interspecies internet and k j
  that 's great when we were rehearsing last night he had fun watching the elephants next user group are the dolphins at the national aquarium please go ahead 
  my name is allison ginsburg and we 're live in baltimore at the national aquarium
 joining me are three of our eight atlantic bottlenose dolphins twenty year old chesapeake who was our first dolphin born here
 her four year old daughter bayley and her half sister
  eleven year old maya
 now here at the national aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care to research and to conservation the dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what 's going on here tonight they 're not really used to having cameras here at eight o 'clock at night
 in addition we are very committed to doing different types of research as diana mentioned our animals are involved in many different research studies
 ng
 those are for you
 okay that 's great thank you and the third user group in thailand
  the golden triangle of thailand with the golden triangle asian elephant foundation elephants and
 we have twenty six elephants here and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants
 but our foundation think elephants is focused
 on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these
 animals are so we 're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant
 put food into the elephant 's mouth show people what 's going on inside their mouths and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are
 ng okay that 's great thanks josh and once again we 've been building great relationships among them just since we 've been rehearsing so
  that point if we can go back to the other computer we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the internet
 and we went to the best possible person i can think of which is vint cerf who is one of the founders who gave us the internet vint vc
 thank you neil applause
 a long time ago in a galaxy oops wrong script
 forty years ago bob kahn and i did
  the design of the internet thirty years ago we turned it on
 just last year we turned on the production internet you 've been using the experimental version for the last thirty years the production version
 it uses ip version six it has three point four times ten to the thirty eight th possible terminations that 's a number only that congress can appreciate
 but it leads to what
  coming next when bob and i did this design
 we thought we were building a system to connect computers together what we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together
 and what you 've seen tonight
 tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species that these other intelligent sentient species
  should be part of the system too this is the system as it looks today by the way this is what the internet looks like to a computer that 's trying to figure out where the traffic is supposed to go this is generated by a program
 that 's looking at the connectivity of the internet and how all the various networks are connected together
  about four hundred thousand networks
 interconnected run independently
 by four hundred thousand different operating agencies and the only reason this works is that they all use the same standard tcp ip protocols
 well you know where this is headed
 the internet of things tell us that a lot of computer enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too
  appliances that you use around the house that you use
 in your office that you carry around with yourself or in the car that 's the internet of things that 's coming now what 's important about what these people are doing
 is that they 're beginning to learn how to communicate
 with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment we 're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn 't just another person
 well you can see what 's coming next
 all kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system and i can 't wait to see these experiments unfold
 what happens after that
 well let 's see
 there are machines that need to talk to machines and that we need to talk to and so as time goes on we 're going to have to learn
 how to communicate with computers and how to get
  to communicate with us
 in the way that we 're accustomed to not with keyboards not with mice but with speech and gestures and all the natural human language that we 're accustomed to so we 'll need 
  something like c three po to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with
 and mars
 it 's operating on the international space station
 it 's part of the spacecraft that 's in orbit around the sun that 's rendezvoused with two planets so the interplanetary system is on its way but there 's a last project which the defense 
  advanced research projects agency which funded the original arpanet funded the internet funded the interplanetary architecture is now funding a project to design a spacecraft
  to get to the nearest star in one hundred years time
 what that means is that what we 're learning
 with these interactions with other species will teach us ultimately how we might interact with an alien from another world
 i can hardly wait
  thank you and i would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each and we thank you for that
 i have so many questions but
 maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know 
 today this is the first time you 're talking about it tell me a little bit about where you 're going to take the idea what
  think we want to
 engage as many people here as possible in helping us
 think of smart interfaces that will make all this possible ng
 and just mechanically there 's a five hundred and one c three and web infrastructure and all of that but it 's not quite ready to turn on so we 'll roll that out and contact us if you want the information on it the idea is this will be
 much like the internet functions as a network of networks which is vint 's core contribution this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives that are wonderful individually
  to link them globally jc right and do you have a web address that we might look for yet
 and very quickly
 just to clarify some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought well that 's just a webcam what 's special about it if you could talk for just a moment about how you want to go past that ng
 so this is scalable
  video infrastructure not for a few to a few but many to many so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing and content sharing across these sites
 around the planet so there 's a lot of back end signal processing
 not for one to many but for many to many jc
 right and then on a practical level which technologies are you looking at first i know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this dr we 're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins this is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work and
 we just got our first seed money
  today towards that so it 's our first project jc wow well done all right well thank you all so much for joining us it 's such a delight to have you on the stage
