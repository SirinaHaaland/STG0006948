  this is
 your conference  
 and i think you have a right to know a little bit right now in this transition period about this guy who 's going to be looking after it for you for a bit 
 so i 'm just going to grab a chair here
 two years ago at ted 
 i think i 've come to this conclusion i think i may have been suffering from a strange delusion  
 i think that i may have believed unconsciously
  was kind of a business hero  
 i had this company that
 i 'd spent fifteen years building it 's called future it was a magazine publishing company it had recently gone public
 and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars a number i i didn 't really understand 
 a magazine i 'd recently launched called
  business two point zero was fatter than a telephone directory  busy pumping hot air into the bubble 
 and
 i was i was the forty percent owner of a of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more and all this had come from
  fifteen years earlier i was a science journalist who people just laughed at when i said i really would like to start my own computer magazine 
 and
 fifteen years later there are one hundred of them and two thousand people on staff and it was it was just such heady times the date was
 february two thousand i thought the little graph
  business life that kind of looked a bit like moore 's law ever upward and to the right it was going to go on forever i mean it had to right 
 i was in for quite a surprise
  the dotcom ironically called snowball was the
 very last consumer web company to go public
 the next month before nasdaq exploded
  i watched
 everything that i 'd built
 crumbling and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and and fifteen years work would have come for nothing and it was gut wrenching
  it took eight years of blood sweat and tears to reach three hundred and fifty employees something which i was very
 proud of in the business february
 two thousand and one in one day we laid off three hundred and fifty people 
 and before the bloodshed was finished one thousand people had lost their jobs from from my companies
  i felt sick  i
 watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a
  every day for eighteen months 
 and worse than that far worse than that 
 my sense of self worth was kind of evaporating i was going around with this big
 sign on my forehead loser
 and i think what disgusts me more than anything looking back is how the hell did i let
 my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing
 well in the end we were able to save future and snowball but
 i was at that point  ready to move on and to cut a long story short  here 's where i came to 
 and the reason i 'm telling this story is that i believe from many conversations that a lot of
  have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster emotional rollercoaster in the last couple years this has been a big big transition time  and
 i believe that this conference can play
 a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next
 stage to whatever 's next the
 theme next year is re birth it was at the same ted two years ago when richard and i reached an agreement on the
  future of ted  and at about the same time  and i think partly because of that i started doing something that i 'd forgotten about in my
 business focus  i started to read again  and i discovered that
 while i 'd been busy playing business games there 'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of
 psychology to evolutionary psychology
 to anthropology to all this stuff had had changed and the way in which you could think about us as a as a species and
 us as a planet had just changed so much and it was incredibly exciting and what was really most exciting
 and i i think richard wurman discovered this at least twenty years before i did was that all this stuff
 connected it 's connected it all hooks into each other we talk about this a lot and i thought about trying to give an example of of this so
 just one example  madame de gaulle the wife of the french president was famously asked once what do you most desire 
 and she answered
  when you think about it  it 's very true  what we all most desire is a penis or 
 happiness as we say in english 
 and something 
 good luck with that one in the japanese translation room
 applause but something as basic 
  as happiness  which twenty years ago would have been just something for discussion in the in the church or mosque or synagogue
  you can ask about it which are really interesting you can ask about what causes it biochemically  neuroscience  serotonin all that stuff 
 you can ask what are the psychological causes of it  nature nurture  current circumstance turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind blowing 
 you can view it as a computing problem an artificial intelligence problem 
 do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it
  work properly you can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say  why is it that a billion people on this planet
 are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of of happiness  and whereas almost all the rest of them 
 regardless of how much money they have whether it 's two dollars a
  did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways the
 ant 's brain parasitized to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate are we the victims of a mass delusion  and
  to understand even something as important to us as happiness you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions and there 's nowhere
 that i 've discovered other than ted
 where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions  and so  it 's the profound thing that richard talks about to understand anything  
 you just need to understand the little bits a little bit about everything that surrounds it  and so gradually over these
  three days  you start off kind of trying to figure out why am i listening to all this irrelevant stuff and at the end of the four days
  your brain is humming and you feel energized alive and excited and it 's because all these different bits have been put together it 's the total brain experience we 're going to it 's the mental equivalent of the full body massage
  enough of the theory chris tell us what you 're actually going to do all right 
 so i will  here 's the vision for ted number one 
 do nothing  this thing ain 't broke so i ain 't gonna fix it 
  jeff bezos kindly remarked to me chris ted is a really great
  you 're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad
  i gave myself the job title of ted custodian ted custodian for a reason  and i will promise you right here and now that the core values that make ted special are not going to be interfered with 
 truth 
  no platforms 
 just the pursuit of
 interest wherever it lies across all the disciplines that are represented here that 's not going to be changed at all 
 number two i am going to put together an incredible line up of
  speakers for next year
 the time scale on which ted operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines  there 's a year to do this and already
 i hope to show you a bit later there 's twenty five or so terrific speakers signed up for next year and i 'm getting fantastic help from the community this is just such
  our contacts reach pretty much everyone who 's interesting in the country if not the planet it 's true
 number three i do want to if i can 
 find a way of extending the ted experience throughout throughout the year a little bit and one key way that we 're going to do this is to introduce this
  books kind of saved me in the last couple years and
 that that 's a gift that i would like to pass on so when you sign up for 
 every six weeks you 'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they 're linked to ted 
 they may well be by a ted speaker  and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year
  having had the same intellectual emotional journey  i think it
