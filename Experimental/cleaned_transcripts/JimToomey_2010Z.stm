  cartoons are basically short stories i tried to find one that didn 't have a whole lot of words
  have happy endings so how did i get started cartooning i doodled a lot as a kid
 and if you spend enough time doodling sooner or later something happens all your career options run out so you have to
 make a living cartooning actually i fell in love with the ocean when i was a little boy when i was about eight or nine
 and i was particularly fascinated with sharks this is some of my early work
 eventually my mom took the red crayon away so
  but i 'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently
 and it 's become the foundation of my work because i feel like if if in a day i can see the ocean differently then i can evoke that same kind of change in others especially kids
 before that day this is how i saw the ocean it 's just a big blue surface and this is how we 've seen the ocean since the beginning of time
 it 's a mystery
  's been a lot of folklore
 developed around the ocean mostly negative and that prompted people to make maps like this with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land but when you get to the waters edge
 the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint and this is the way i saw the ocean at school
 as if to say all geography and science
  this part 's not going to be on the test
 but that day i flew low over the islands it was a family trip to the caribbean and i flew in a small plane low over the islands
 this is what i saw i saw hills and valleys
 i saw forests and meadows
 i saw grottoes and secret gardens and places i 'd love to hide as a kid if i could only breathe underwater and best of all i saw the animals i saw a manta ray that
  big as the plane i was flying in and i flew over a lagoon with a shark in it and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born
 so from that day on i was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land but my head was down there underwater
 up until that day these were the animals that were most common in my life
 these were the ones i 'd like to draw
 all variations of four legs and fur
  but when you got to the ocean my imagination was no competition for nature every time i 'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board
 i 'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier and the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon
 and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science fiction movie
 whenever i talk to kids i always like to tell them the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive it 's not a dinosaur it 's a whale
  animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean speaking of dinosaurs sharks are basically the same fish they were three hundred million years ago
 so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like that 's what a dinosaur looks like so you have living dinosaurs
 and space aliens animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions it 's just incredible no hollywood designer could come up
  something more interesting than that
 or this fangtooth the particles in the water make it look like it 's floating in outer space
 could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope and we saw that it would start a whole new space race
 but instead we stick a camera in the deep ocean and we see a fish and it doesn 't capture our imagination
  as a society we we say to ourselves maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something
 so what i 'd like to do now is
 try a little drawing so i 'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here
 i love to draw the deep sea fish because they are so ugly but beautiful in their own way
  a little bioluminescence here give him a headlight maybe a brake light
 turn signals
 but it 's easy to see why these these animals make such great cartoon characters their shapes and sizes
 so some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book for instance
 take these sea turtles
 they kind of have a sixth sense like like superman 's x ray vision they can sense the magnetic fields of the earth
 and they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles
  of open ocean
 i kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with
 or take
 this sea cucumber it 's not an animal we
 draw cartoons of or
 draw at all he 's like an underwater spiderman he shoots out
  these sticky webs
 to entangle his enemy of course sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears which in my opinion makes them much more interesting a superhero
 he can 't spin a web anytime he 's got to pull his pants down first
 or the blowfish the blowfish is like the incredible
  can change its body into a big intimidating fish in a matter of seconds
 i 'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated
 and then i 'm going to attempt
 onscreen animation here let 's see try
  when he wants to be intimidating or take this swordfish
 could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose do you think he wakes up in the morning looks in the mirror and says somebody 's getting stabbed today
 or this lionfish for instance
 imagine trying to make friends covered with razor sharp poisonous barbs
 it 's not something you want to put on your facebook page right
 my
 characters are my lead character 's a shark named sherman he 's a great white shark and i kind of broke the mold with with sherman i didn 't want to go with this
 ruthless predator
 image he 's kind of just out there making a living he 's sort of a homer simpson with fins and then his
 sidekick is a sea turtle as i mentioned before
 named filmore he uses his wonderful skills at navigation to
 wander the oceans looking for a mate and
  he does manage to find them but great navigation skills lousy pick up lines he never seems to
 settle on any particular girl
 i have a hermit crab named hawthorne who doesn 't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark
 and then i 'll introduce you to one more character
 this guy ernest who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body
 so with characters you can make stories sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room
  and seeing what happens so imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom
 or sometimes i take them to places that people have never heard of because they 're underwater for instance i took them skiing in the mid atlantic range which is this
 range of mountains in the middle of the atlantic
 i 've taken them to the sea of japan where they met giant jellyfish i 've taken them camping in the kelp forests of california this next one here i did a story
  on the census of marine life and that was a lot of fun because as most of you know it 's a real project we 've heard about
 but it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters
 so we start off the story with ernest who volunteers as a census taker
 he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish
 then he meets the yeti crab the famous vampire squid elusive hard to
  find and the dumbo octopus which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn 't have to change a thing when i drew it i did another story on marine debris
 i was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business and they
 i asked them so what 's what 's one issue you would like everyone to know more about and they they
  this one friend of mine said i 've got one word for you plastic
 and i told him well i need something a little sexier than that plastic just is not going to do it
 we sort of worked things out he wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride which doesn 't really work in voice balloons very well i couldn 't fit them in
 so what i did was i made an adventure strip basically
 this bottle travels a long way what i 'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn 't really go away it just continues to wash downstream and a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean
 which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it especially if they can 't stand each other like these two
 so
 i sent them to boise idaho
 where they dropped a plastic bottle into the boise sewer system and it ended up in the boise river
 and then on to the columbia river
  and then to the mouth of the columbia and to the pacific ocean
 and then on to this place called the great pacific garbage patch which is this giant pacific gyre in the north pacific where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around
 and then back onto the lagoon
 so that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along so
 a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway but we we really talked about marine debris and plastic
 in the course of that one the third
  storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult it was on shark finning and i felt really strongly about this issue
 and i felt like since my main character was a shark
 the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this now finning is the act of taking a shark
 cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water it 's cruel it 's wasteful there 's nothing funny or entertaining
  it but i really wanted to take this issue on
 i had to kill my main character who is a shark we start with sherman in a chinese restaurant who gets a fortune that he 's about to get caught by a trawler
 which he does
 and then he dies he gets finned and then he gets thrown overboard ostensibly he 's dead now and so i killed a character that 's been in the newspaper for fifteen years
 so i got a lot of reader feedback on that one
 meanwhile the other characters are
  talking about shark fin soup i do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue
 sherman 's up in shark heaven this is what i love about comic strips you know you really don 't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because if you start with a talking shark readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door
 you can kind of do anything
 it becomes a near death experience for sherman meanwhile
  ernest finds his fins on the internet there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins so i
 kind of exposed that and he clicks the buy now button
 and voila next day air they show up and they surgically reattach them
 i ended that series with a kind of a mail in petition that encouraged our national marine fishery service to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management
 thanks i 'd
 like to end with a little metaphor here i 've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent mission blue and this is what i came up with
 imagine you 're in an enormous room and it 's as dark as a cave
 and you can have anything in that room anything you want but you can 't see anything you 've been given one tool
  a hammer
 so you wander around in the darkness and you bump into something and it feels like it 's made of stone it 's big it 's heavy you can 't carry it away so you bang it with your hammer
 and you break off a piece and you take the piece out into the daylight
 and you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster
 so you say to yourself well that 's worth something so you go back into the room and you break this thing to pieces and you haul it away and you find other things and you break that
  up and you haul those away and you 're getting all kinds of cool stuff and you hear other people doing the same thing so you get this sense of urgency like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible
 and then some yells stop
 and they turn up the lights and you realize where you are you 're in the louvre
 and you 've taken all this complexity and beauty
 and you 've turned it into a cheap commodity and that 's what we 're doing with the ocean and part of what mission blue is about
 is yelling stop
 so that each of us explorer scientist cartoonist singer chef
 can turn up the lights in their own way and that 's what i hope my comic strip does in a small way that 's why i like what i do thanks for listening
  and then some yells
