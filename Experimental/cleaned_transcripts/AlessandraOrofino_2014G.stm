  of the world 's population lives in our cities  in developing countries one third of that population is living in
  of global energy consumption
 occurs in our cities  and eighty percent of gas emissions that cause global warming
 come from our cities  
 so things that you and i might think about as global problems  like climate change the energy crisis or poverty
  are really in many ways city problems  
 they will not be solved unless people who live in cities  like most of us 
 actually start doing a better job because right now  we are not doing a very good one 
 and that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of
 city life 
 first our citizens ' willingness to engage with democratic institutions 
 second our cities ' ability to really include all of their residents  
 and lastly our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives 
 when it comes to engagement
  the data is very clear  
 voter turnout around the world peaked in the late ' 80s and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before 
 and if those numbers are bad at the national level at the level of our cities  they are just dismal 
 in the last two years two of the world 's most consolidated
  nationwide municipal elections  
 in france  voter turnout hit a record low  
 almost forty percent of voters decided not to show up 
 in the u s the numbers were even scarier in some american cities  voter turnout was close to five percent
  in for a second we 're talking about democratic cities in which
  percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders 
 the city of l a a city of four million people elected its mayor with just a bit over two hundred thousand votes 
 that was the lowest turnout the city had seen in one hundred years
 right here  in my city of rio  
 in spite of mandatory voting almost thirty percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home 
 and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections  
  you don 't need to look very far in order to find proof of that the city of rio is incredibly unequal 
 this is leblon leblon is the city 's richest neighborhood  and this is 
 this is where over seventy thousand of the city 's poorest residents
  it sits somewhere in between the hdi of algeria and gabon  so
  like so many cities across the global south 
 is a place where you can go from northern europe to sub saharan africa in the space of thirty minutes 
 if you drive that is if you take public transit it 's about two hours  
 and lastly  perhaps most importantly 
 cities  with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable could be the ideal places
  for human happiness to flourish we
 like being around people we are social animals  
 instead countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy  
 the united states population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the
  past three decades  and the main reason is this
 the american way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many many american cities  
 and as a result  they have seen a decline of relations 
 of the things that make us happy many studies show an increase in solitude
 and a decrease in solidarity  honesty and social and civic participation so
 how do we start building cities that make us care 
 cities that value their most important asset  the incredible diversity
 of the people who live in them cities that make
  us happy  
 well i believe that if we want to change what our cities look like 
 then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results that we have right now  
 we need a participation revolution  and we need
  the idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore 
 people are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it 's time to delegate that power to someone else 
 if the protests that swept brazil in june two thousand and thirteen have taught us anything
 's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context  
 we are beaten up  humiliated or arrested  
 and this needs to change because when it does not only
  with the structures of representation but also complement these structures with direct  
 effective and collective decision making 
 decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature  
 decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live  
 but there is a catch
  obviously 
 enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare and there 's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role 
 by making it easier for people to organize communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time  
 unfortunately for
  us when it comes to fostering democratic processes our city governments have not used technology to its full potential  
 so far most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data
  fallen trees or broken lamps 
 they have also to a lesser extent  invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them 
 just like my mom when i was eight and she told me that i had a choice i had to be in bed by eight
 p m but i could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas that 's not participation and in fact governments
  not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters
 the way we allocate our budget  
 the way we occupy our land  and the way we manage our natural resources those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest
  the good news is and i do have good news to share with you we don 't need to wait for governments to do this i have reason to believe
 that it 's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation 
 three years ago i cofounded an organization called meu rio 
 and we make it easier for people in the city of rio to organize around
  causes and places that they care about in their own city and have an impact on those causes and places every day  
 in these past three years meu rio grew to a network of one hundred and sixty thousand citizens of rio 
 about forty percent of those members are young people aged twenty to
  is one in every fifteen young people of that age in rio today  
 amongst our members is this adorable little girl bia to your right
  and bia was just eleven years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition her school actually ranks among
  the best public schools in the country  
 and it was going to be demolished by the rio de janeiro state government to build i kid you not a parking lot for the world cup right before the event happened  
 bia started a campaign and we even watched her school twenty four seven through webcam monitoring  
 and many months afterwards  the government changed their minds bia 's school stayed
 in place there 's also jovita 
 she 's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about ten years ago  
 and since then she has been looking for her daughter in that process she found out that first  she was not alone 
 in the last year alone two thousand and thirteen 
  six thousand people disappeared in the state of rio  
 but she also found out that in spite of that rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases  
 in other brazilian cities  those systems have helped solve up to eighty percent
 of missing persons cases  she started a campaign  and after the secretary of security got sixteen thousand emails from people asking him to do this 
 and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases it was open to the public
 at the end of last month  and jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy  
 and then  there is leandro leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in rio  and he created a recycling project in the slum 
 at the end of last year december sixteen he received an eviction
  order by the rio de janeiro state government
 giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years  
 the plan was to hand it over to a developer who planned to turn it into a construction site 
 leandro started a campaign using one of our tools  the pressure
  and the state government changed their minds before christmas eve 
 these stories make me happy  
 but not just because they have happy endings they make me happy because they are happy beginnings  
 the teacher and parent community at bia 's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further 
 leandro has
  ambitious plans to take his model to other low income communities in rio  and jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created  
 bia  jovita and leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city governments around the world need to know 
  are ready to decide on our common destinies because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone  
 and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another  and we are
  ready to do this in cities around the world right now  
 with the our cities network the meu rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities 
 we have already started doing it in so paulo with incredible results
  that can inspire us  
 challenge us  and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives 
 it is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking
  recycling projects or construction sites  
 loneliness or solidarity cars or buses and it is our responsibility to do that now  
 for ourselves for our families for the people who make our lives worth living and for the incredible creativity 
  beauty  and wonder that make our cities  in spite of all of their problems  the greatest invention of our time
