  i got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world 
 i was in india this past year and i may have seen the last cases of polio in the world  there 's nothing that makes you feel more
  the blessing and the honor
 of working in a program like that than to know that something that horrible
 no longer exists  so i 'm going to tell you so i 'm going
 to show you some dirty pictures they are
 difficult to watch  but you should look at them with optimism  because the horror of these pictures
 will be
 matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist 
 but first i 'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey  
 my background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect 
 when i was an intern
  i heard about a group of native americans who had taken over alcatraz island and a native american who wanted to give birth on that island and no other doctor wanted to go
 and help her
 give birth i went out to alcatraz and i lived on the island for several weeks 
 she gave birth i caught the baby i got off the island  i landed in san francisco  and all the press wanted to talk to me because my three weeks on the island
 made me an expert in indian affairs
  i wound up on every television show someone saw me on television they called me up and they asked me if i 'd like to be in a movie
 and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco
 to england and i said yes i would do that  so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie
 called 
  you know from the ' 60s you 're either on the bus or you 're off the bus  i was on the bus my wife of thirty seven years and i 
 the bus  our bus ride took us from san francisco to london then we switched buses at the big pond
 we then got on two more buses and we drove through turkey and iran afghanistan over the khyber pass into pakistan like every other young doctor
  us at the khyber pass and that 's our bus  we had some difficulty getting over the khyber pass  
 but we wound up in india  
 and then like everyone else in our generation we went to live in a himalayan monastery 
 this is just like a residency program for those of you that are in medical school 
 and we studied with a wise man
  a guru named karoli baba who then
 told me to get rid of the dress put on a three piece suit go join the united nations as a diplomat
 and work for the world health organization and he made an outrageous prediction
 that smallpox would be eradicated and that this was god 's gift to humanity because of the hard work of dedicated scientists  and that prediction came
  this little girl is rahima banu  and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world and this document
 is the certificate that the global commission signed certifying the world
 to have eradicated the first disease in history  the key to eradicating smallpox was early detection
 early response  i 'm going to ask you to repeat that early detection early response can you say that
  detection  early response larry brilliant smallpox was the worst disease in history  it killed more people than all the wars in history in the last century  
 it killed five hundred million people
 you 're reading about larry page already somebody reads very fast 
 in the year that larry page and sergey brin with whom i have a certain affection and a new affiliation
 in the year in which they were born two million people died of smallpox  we declared smallpox eradicated
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty this is the most important slide that i 've ever seen in public health [ sovereigns killed by smallpox ] because it shows you
 to be the richest and the strongest and to be kings and queens of the world
  not protect you from dying of smallpox  never can you doubt that we are all in this together  
 but to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign
 is the wrong perspective you should see it from the perspective of a mother watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly day one
  day two 
 day three
  mother and you 're watching your child and on day six  
 you see pustules that become hard  
 day seven they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication day eight and al gore said earlier that the most
 photographed image in the world the most printed image in the world was that of the earth but this was in one thousand nine hundred and seventy four and as of that moment this photograph
 was the photograph that was the most widely printed because we printed two billion copies
 of this photograph and we took them hand to hand door to door to show people and ask them
 if there was smallpox in their house  because that was our surveillance system we didn 't have google we didn 't have web crawlers  we didn 't have computers
 by day nine
 you look at this picture and you 're horrified i look at this picture and i say thank god 
 because it 's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox  and i know this child will live  
 and by day thirteen the lesions are scabbing his eyelids are swollen  but
  you know this child has no other secondary infection and by day twenty while he will be scarred for life he will live 
 there are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that this is confluent smallpox in which there isn 't a single place on the body where you could put a finger
 and not be covered
 by lesions  flat smallpox  which killed one hundred percent of people who got it and hemorrhagic smallpox the most cruel of all which had a
  predilection for pregnant women i 've probably had fifty women die  they all had hemorrhagic smallpox i 've never seen anybody die from it who wasn 't a pregnant woman 
  embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease in that year there were thirty four countries affected with smallpox
  down to five countries  but in that year smallpox exploded throughout india  
 and india was the place where smallpox made its last stand 
 in one thousand nine hundred and seventy four india had a population of six hundred million there are twenty one linguistic states
 in india which is like saying twenty one different countries
  twenty million people on the road at any time in buses and trains 
 walking five hundred thousand villages one hundred and twenty million households and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity 
 shitala mata the cooling mother 
 and it was
 wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the
  that had smallpox deities smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world so how we eradicated smallpox
 was mass vaccination wouldn 't work you could vaccinate everybody in india but one year later there 'd be twenty one million new babies which was then the population of canada  
 it wouldn 't do just to vaccinate everyone you had to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time and draw a circle of
  immunity around it and that 's what we did 
 in india alone my one hundred and fifty thousand best friends and i went door to door with that same picture 
 to every single house in india we made over one billion house calls  
 and in the process  i learned something very important every time we did a
  we had a spike
 in the number of reports of smallpox  
 when we didn 't search  we had the illusion that there was no disease when we did search  we had the illusion that there was more disease a surveillance 
  system was necessary because what we needed was
  so we searched and we searched and we found every case of smallpox in india  we had a reward  we raised the reward  we continued to increase the reward  we had a scorecard that we wrote on every house  
 and as we did that the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero  
 and in one thousand nine hundred and
  we declared the globe free of smallpox  it was
 the largest campaign in united nations history until the iraq war 
 one hundred and fifty thousand people from all over the world doctors of every race religion culture and nation who fought
 side by side brothers and sisters 
 with each other not against each other in a common cause to make the world better  
 but smallpox was the fourth disease
 that was intended for eradication we failed three other times  we failed against malaria yellow fever and yaws  but soon
 we may see polio eradicated but the key to eradicating polio
 is early detection  early response  
 this may be the year we eradicate polio that will make it the second disease in history  and david heymann who 's
  watching this on the webcast david keep on going  we 're close we 're down to four countries 
 i feel like hank aaron barry bonds can replace me any time let 's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about 
 i was just in
 india working on the polio program
 the polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door that is the surveillance system 
 but we need to have early detection
 early response blindness the same thing  
 the key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness so you can mount the the correct response  
 the seva
  foundation was started by a group of alumni
 of the smallpox eradication programme  who having climbed the highest mountain tasted the elixir of
 the success of eradicating a disease wanted to do it again  
 and over the last twenty seven years  seva 's programs in fifteen countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people
  seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology
 to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue blindness  which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease 
  and eighty  steve jobs gave me that computer which is apple number
  and it 's still in kathmandu and it 's still working and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money
 for seva  and we conducted the first nepal survey ever done for health and the first nationwide
 blindness survey ever done and we had astonishing results instead of finding out what we thought was the case
 that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma
 we were astounded to find out
 that blindness was caused instead by cataract
 you can 't cure or prevent what you don 't know is there 
 in your ted packages there 's a dvd infinite vision 
 about dr v and the aravind eye hospital i hope that you will take a look at it 
 aravind which started as a seva project is now the world 's largest and best eye hospital this year that one hospital will give back sight to more
  than three hundred thousand people in tamil nadu india bird flu i stand here as
 a representative of all terrible things this might be the worst  
 the key
 to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and
  we will not have
 a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years
 who stages the progress of a pandemic 
 we are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage with just a little bit of
 this will not be like katrina the world as we know it will stop there 'll be no airplanes flying 
 would you get in an airplane with two hundred and fifty people you didn 't know coughing and sneezing when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you for which you had no antivirals or vaccine 
 i did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in october i asked them these are all fluologists
  and specialists
 in influenza and i asked them the questions you 'd like to ask them 
 what do you think the likelihood is that there 'll be a pandemic if it happens how bad do you think it will be 
 fifteen percent said
 they thought there 'd be a pandemic within three years but much worse than that  
 ninety percent said they thought there 'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren 's lifetime
  and they thought that if there was a pandemic 
 a billion people would get sick 
 as many as one hundred and sixty five million people would die 
 there would be a global recession and depression as our  just in time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke 
 and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars
 would be far worse for
  everyone
 than merely one hundred million people dying  because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits that the consequences are almost unthinkable
  and it 's getting worse because travel is getting so much better  
 let me show you a simulation
 of what a pandemic looks like
  we know what we 're talking about let 's assume for example that the first case occurs in south asia it
 initially goes quite slowly you get two or three discrete locations 
 then there 'll be secondary outbreaks 
 and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won 't know what hit you 
 within three weeks
 it will be everywhere in the world
 now if we had an undo button  and we could go back
 and isolate it and grab it when it first started if we could find it early and we had early detection and early response  and we could put each one of those viruses in jail
 that 's the only way to deal
  with something like a pandemic and let me show you why that is we have a joke this is an epidemic curve and
 everyone in medicine i think ultimately gets to know what it is 
 but the joke is an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve 
 but you don 't get to do that usually you usually arrive right about here what we really want is to arrive right here  so we can stop
  the epidemic  but you can 't always do that but there 's an organization that has been able to find a way
 to learn when the first cases occur and that is called gphin it 's the global public health information network  
 and that simulation that i showed you that you thought was bird flu that was sars and sars is the
  announced it and because of that we were able to stop
 the sars pandemic and i think we owe a great debt of gratitude to gphin and to ron st john who i hope is in the audience some
  and ted has flown ron here from ottawa where gphin is located  because not only did gphin find
 sars early but you may have seen last week that iran announced
 that they had bird
  flu in iran  but gphin found the bird flu in iran not february fourteen but last september we need an early warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity 's worst nightmare 
 and so my ted wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences
  pandemic bird flu early detection early response  it is a litany it is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases
 is to find them early and to kill them before they spread so my ted wish is for you to help build a global
  to protect us against humanity 's worst nightmares  and what i thought i would call it
 is early detection but it should really be called
  in all seriousness  
 because this idea is birthed in ted 
 i would like it to be a legacy of ted  
 and i 'd like to call it the international system for total early disease detection
  then becomes our mantra  
 so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu we find it and immediately contain it instead of a novel virus caused by by 
 or shift or drift  we find it and we contain it instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in bhopal
  we find them  and we respond to them instead of famine hidden until it is too late  we detect it 
 and we respond 
 and instead of a system which is owned by a government  and hidden in the bowels of government  let 's build an early detection system that 's freely
  available to anyone in the world in their own language let 's make it transparent
 not owned by any single country or company  housed in a neutral country with redundant backup in a different time zone
 and a different continent 
 and let 's build it on gphin let 's start with gphin 
 let 's increase the websites that they crawl from twenty thousand to twenty million let 's increase the languages
  crawl from seven to seventy or more 
 let 's build in outbound confirmation messages using text messages or sms or instant messaging to find out from people who are within one hundred meters
 of the rumor that you hear 
 if it is in fact valid and let 's add satellite confirmation and we 'll add gapminder 's amazing graphics to the front end and we 'll grow it as
  a moral force in the world  finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them and sending our response to them 
 so that next year 
 instead of us meeting here  lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world  we will have pulled together  used the unique skills and the magic of this community  
 and be proud that we have done everything we can
  to stop pandemics other catastrophes and change the world  beginning right now
  just so everyone understands  you 're saying that by creating web crawlers  looking on the internet
 for patterns they can detect something suspicious
 before who before anyone else can see it give an example of how that could possibly be true
  you 're not mad about the copyright violation ca no i love it lb 
 well as ron st john i hope you 'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him when he started gphin
  there was an outbreak of bird flu h5n1 it was in hong kong and a remarkable doctor in hong kong responded immediately by slaughtering one
  point five million chickens and birds and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks  immediate detection  
 immediate response  then a number of years went by and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu  
 ron and his team in ottawa
 began to crawl the web only crawling twenty thousand different websites mostly periodicals
 and they read about and heard about a concern of a
  lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu  they reported this to 
  took a little while taking action because who will only receive a report from a government  because it 's the united nations  
 but they were able to point to who and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like
  bird flu that turned out to be sars that 's how the world found out about sars  
 and because of that we were able to stop sars now what 's really important is that  before there was gphin 
 one hundred percent of all the world 's reports of bad things
 whether you 're talking about famine or you 're talking about bird flu or you 're talking about ebola one hundred percent of all those reports came from nations  the moment
  these guys in ottawa on a budget of eight hundred thousand dollars a year got cracking
 seventy five percent of all the reports in the world came from gphin twenty five percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other one hundred and eighty nations  
 now here 's what 's really interesting after they 'd been working for a couple years  
 what do you think happened to those nations they felt pretty stupid so they started sending in their reports
  early and now their
 reporting percentage is down to fifty percent  because other nations have started to report so can you find diseases early by crawling the web of course you can 
 can you find it even earlier than gphin does now of course you can you saw that they found sars using their chinese web crawler
 a full six weeks before they found it using
  their english web crawler well they 're only crawling in seven languages these bad viruses really don 't have any intention of showing up first in english or spanish or french
