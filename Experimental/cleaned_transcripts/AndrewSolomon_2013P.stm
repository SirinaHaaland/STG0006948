  homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty  it is a pathetic little
  substitute for reality a pitiable flight from life 
 as such it deserves no compassion it deserves no treatment
 as minority martyrdom  and it deserves not to be deemed anything
 but a pernicious sickness that 's from time magazine in 
  when i was three years
  the president of the united states came out in favor of gay marriage 
 and my question is how did we get from there to here how did an illness become an identity
  when i was perhaps six years old  
 i went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother and at the end of buying our shoes  the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home 
 my brother wanted a red balloon  and i wanted a pink balloon 
 my mother said that she thought i 'd really rather have a blue balloon  but i said that i definitely wanted
  the pink one and she reminded me that my favorite color was blue  
 the fact that my favorite color now is blue  but i 'm still gay 
 is evidence of both my mother 's influence and its limits 
 when i was little my mother used to say
 the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world  and until you have children you don 't know what it 's like 
 and when i was little i took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me  
 and when i was an adolescent  i thought  that i 'm gay  and so i probably can 't have a family  and when she said it it made me anxious 
 and after i came out of the closet when she continued to
  say it  it made me furious i said i 'm gay  that 's not the direction that i 'm headed in  and i want you to stop saying that 
 about twenty years ago i was asked by my editors at the new york times magazine to write a piece about deaf culture 
 and i was rather taken aback i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness those poor people they couldn
  hear they lacked hearing and what could we do for them  
 and then i went out into the deaf world  i went to deaf clubs  i saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry  
 i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville tennessee
 where people complained about that slurry
  and as i plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world  i become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said we don 't lack hearing 
 we have membership in a culture were saying something that was viable it wasn 't my culture and i didn 't particularly want to rush off and join
  but i appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it it felt as valuable as latino culture or gay culture or jewish culture
  it felt as valid perhaps even as american culture 
 then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf  
 and when her daughter was born she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me she was facing the question of what to do with this
  child should she say you 're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity get involved in the little people of america become 
 aware of what was happening for dwarfs  and i suddenly thought most deaf children are born to hearing parents those hearing parents tend to try to cure them  those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence  most gay people are born to straight
  parents those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world and those gay people have to discover identity later on and here was this friend 
  of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter  and i thought there it is again a family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be
  and i hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity  
 there are vertical identities which are passed down generationally from parent to child 
 those are things like ethnicity  frequently nationality  language often religion those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children 
 and while some of them can be difficult  there 's no attempt to cure them  you can
  that it 's harder in the united states our current presidency notwithstanding to be a person of color  and yet we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of 
  children born to african americans and asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair  
  these are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers  and those identities those horizontal identities people have almost always tried to cure  
 and i wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them  
 and it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place there 's
 there 's family acceptance  and there 's social acceptance and they don 't always coincide  and a lot of the time people who have these conditions are very angry because they 
  feel as though their parents don 't love them  when what actually has happened is that their parents don 't accept them  
  takes time it always takes time 
 one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown 
 when he was born he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism a very disabling condition  and his parents were told that he would never walk he would never talk he would have no intellectual 
  capacity  and he would probably not even recognize them  and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the
  hospital so that he could die there quietly  and his mother said she wasn 't going to do it  and she took her son home and even though she didn 't have a lot of educational or financial advantages 
 she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism  and she got clinton enrolled with him and in the course of his childhood he had thirty major
  and he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures as a result of which he now can walk  and while he was there they sent tutors around to help him with his school 
  work  and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do  and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family 
  car that accommodated his unusual body  
 and his mother told me this story of coming home one day and he went to college nearby and she said i saw that car which you can always recognize in the parking lot of a bar she said 
 and i thought to myself 
 they 're six feet tall he 's three feet tall two beers for them is four beers for him she said i knew i couldn 't go in there and interrupt him but i went home  and i left him eight messages on his cell phone
 she said and then i thought  if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he 'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies 
 and i said to her what do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming accomplished wonderful person
 and she said what did i do i loved him that 's all clinton just always had that light in him  
 and his father and i were lucky enough
 to be the first to see it there i 'm going to quote from another magazine of the ' 60s this one is from 
 the atlantic monthly voice of liberal america written by an important
  bioethicist he said 
 there is no reason to feel guilty about putting a down syndrome child away whether it is put away
 in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium
 or in a more responsible  lethal sense 
 it is sad yes dreadful  but it carries no guilt true guilt arises only from an offense against
  a person  and a down 's is not a person 
 there 's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we 've made in the treatment of gay people the fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day 
 but we forget how we used to see people who had other differences
  how we used to see people who were disabled how inhuman we held people to be and the change that 's been accomplished there which is almost equally radical 
 is one that we pay not very much attention to 
 one of the families i interviewed tom and karen robards were taken aback when as young and successful new yorkers their first child was diagnosed with down syndrome 
 they thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be and so they decided they would build
  a little center two classrooms that they started
 with a few other parents to educate kids with d s and over the years that center grew into something called the cooke center where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught 
 in the time since that atlantic monthly story ran the life expectancy for people with down syndrome has tripled
  the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are actors those who are writers some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood  
 the robards had a lot to do with that and i said do you regret it do you wish your child didn 't have down syndrome do you wish you 'd never heard of it 
 and interestingly his father
  for david our son i regret it  because for david it 's a difficult way to be in the world  and i 'd like to give david an easier life  
 but i think if we lost everyone with down syndrome it would be a catastrophic loss 
 and karen robards said to me i 'm with tom for david i would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life  
 but speaking for myself well i would never have believed
  years ago when he was born that i could come to such a point
 speaking for myself it 's made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life  that speaking for myself  i wouldn 't give it up for anything in the world 
 we live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never
  imagined before  most deaf infants born in the united states now will receive cochlear implants which are
 put into the brain and connected to a receiver and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech 
 a compound that has been tested in mice
 achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism  and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene grow to full size testing in humans is around the corner 
 there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before making it
  easier and easier for people to eliminate
 those pregnancies or to terminate them  and so we have both social progress and medical progress and i believe in both of them  i believe the social 
  progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful and i think the same thing about the medical progress but i think it 's a tragedy when one of them doesn 't see the other and when i see the way
  they 're intersecting in conditions like the three i 've just described  i sometimes think it 's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the 
  exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan 
 we have to think about how we feel about cures altogether  and a lot of the time the question of parenthood is what do we validate in our
  and what do we cure in them  
 jim sinclair a prominent autism activist said when parents say  ' i wish my child did not have autism '
 what they 're really saying is  ' i wish the child i have did not exist
 and i had a different non autistic child instead '
 read that again  this is what we hear when you mourn over our existence 
 this is what we hear when you pray for a cure that your fondest wish for us
  is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces 
 it 's a very extreme point of view but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don 't want to be cured or changed
 or eliminated they want to be whoever it is that they 've come to be one of the families i interviewed
  for this project was the family of dylan klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the columbine massacre  
 it took a long time to persuade them to talk to me and once they agreed they were so full of their story that they couldn 't stop telling it and the first weekend i spent with them the first of many
 i recorded more than twenty hours of conversation and on sunday night we were all exhausted we were sitting in the kitchen sue klebold was fixing dinner
 and i said if dylan were here now do you have a sense of what you 'd want to ask him 
 and his father said i sure do i 'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing 
 and sue looked at the floor  and she thought for a minute  
 and then she looked back up and said i would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head
  when i had dinner with her a couple of years later one of many dinners that we had together she said 
 you know when it first happened i used to wish that i had never married that i had never had children if i hadn 't gone to ohio state and crossed paths with tom 
 this child wouldn 't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn 't have happened  
 but i 've come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don 't want to
  imagine a life without them  
 i recognize the pain they caused to others for which there can be no forgiveness but the pain they caused to me  there is she said so while i recognize 
 that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born 
  i thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting 
 and then i thought all of us who have children love the children we have with their flaws 
 if some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children i have and give me other better
  children more polite  funnier  nicer  smarter
 i would cling to the children i have and pray away that atrocious spectacle 
 and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won 't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove 
 so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the
  universal experience of parenting which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think where did you come from 
 it turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia there are only so many families of children who
  there are only so many families of prodigies who also face similar challenges in many ways there are only so many families in each of those categories but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating 
 difference within your family is what people are addressing then you discover that it 's a nearly universal phenomenon  ironically it turns out that it 's our differences and our negotiation of difference that unite us
  i decided to have children while i was working on this project 
 and many people were astonished and said but how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong 
 and i said i 'm not studying everything that can go wrong what i 'm studying is how much love there can be even when everything appears to be going
  i thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child i had seen a
 severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect  and when his ashes were interred his mother said 
 i pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed  
 once of the child i wanted
 and once of the son i loved and i figured it was possible then
 for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so 
 so my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in minneapolis  
 i had a close friend from college who 'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children and so she and i have a daughter and mother and daughter live in texas 
 and my husband and i have a son who lives with us all
  the time of whom i am the biological father and our surrogate for the pregnancy was laura  the lesbian mother of oliver and lucy in minneapolis 
 so
 the shorthand is
  five parents of four children in three states 
 and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family  and
 there are people who think that families like mine shouldn 't be allowed to exist and i don 't accept subtractive models of love 
 only additive ones  and i believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on so we need this
  diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness  
 the day after our son was born  the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned  
 he wasn 't extending his legs appropriately she said that might mean that he had brain damage
  in so far as he was extending them he was doing so asymmetrically  which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action  and he had a very large head  which she thought
  might indicate hydrocephalus  and as she told me all of these things i felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor  and i thought here i had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of
  children who are disabled  and i didn 't want to join their number  because what i was encountering was an idea of illness  and like all parents since the dawn of time 
 i wanted to protect my child from illness  and i wanted also to protect myself from illness  and yet i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for that those would
  and if they were his identity they would become my identity that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded  
 we took him to the mri machine we took him to the cat scanner we took this day old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw we felt helpless  and at the end of five hours they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly
  and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp 
 i thought how my mother was right  i thought the love you have for your children
 is unlike any other feeling in the world  and until you have children you don 't know what it feels like
 i think children had ensnared me the moment i connected fatherhood with loss  
 but i 'm not sure i would have noticed that if i hadn 't been so in the thick of this research project of mine 
 i 'd encountered so much strange love  and i fell very naturally
  i saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities  
 during these ten years i had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility  
 and i had come to see how it conquers everything else  
 and while i had sometimes thought the parents i was interviewing were fools  enslaving themselves to a lifetime 's journey with their thankless children
  breed identity out of misery  i realized that day that my research had built me a plank
 and that i was ready to join them on their ship thank you
