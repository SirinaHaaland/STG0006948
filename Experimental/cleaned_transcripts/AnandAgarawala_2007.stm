  era of computer interfaces like they 're very kind of they don 't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and i 'd like to change all that  hit me 
  so i mean this is the kind of status quo interface right it 's very flat kind of rigid and ok so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable mac  you know
  but really it 's the kind of same old crap we 've had for the last  you know thirty years 
 like i think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers i mean it 's point and click it 's like the menus icons
  it 's all the kind of same thing and so one kind of information space that i take inspiration from is my real desk  it 's so much more subtle so much more 
  visceral  and i 'd like to bring that experience to the desktop so i kind of have a
 this is this is bumptop it 's kind of like a new approach to
 desktop computing so you can bump things they 're all physically  you know manipulable and stuff
  point and click it 's like a push and pull things collide as you 'd expect them just like on my real desk  i can let me just grab these guys i can turn things into piles
 instead of just the folders that we have 
 and once things are in a pile i can browse them by throwing them into a grid or you know flip through them like a book
 or i can lay them out like a deck of cards
 when they 're laid out i can pull things to new locations or delete things
 or just quickly sort a whole pile you know just immediately right
  and then  it 's all smoothly animated instead of these jarring changes you see in today 's interfaces  also if i want to add something to a pile well how do i do that i just toss it
  's added right to the top it 's a kind of nice way 
 also some of the stuff we can do is for these individual icons we thought i mean how can we play with the idea of an icon and push that further and one of the things i can do is make it bigger 
 if i want to emphasize it and make it more important  but what 's really cool is that since there 's a physics simulation running under this it 's actually heavier so the lighter stuff
  also like a subtle channel of conveying information right this is heavy so it feels more important  
 so it 's kind of cool  despite computers everywhere paper really hasn 't disappeared because it has a lot of i think valuable properties and some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system
 so one of the things you can do to our icons just like paper is crease them
 and fold them
 just like paper remember
  you know  something for later or if you want to be destructive you can just crumple it up
 and you know toss it to the corner  also just like paper around our workspace we 'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later  and i can do the same thing
 here  and you know you 'll see  post it notes and things like that around people 's offices and i can pull them off when i
  the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that you know okay well my real desk is really messy i don 't want that mess on my
 computer so one thing we have for that is like a grid align kind of
 so you get that more traditional desktop things are kind of grid aligned more boring but
 you still have that kind of colliding and bumping and you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop let
  just break this shelf okay
 that shelf broke  i think beyond the icons i think another really cool domain for this software i think it applies to more than just icons
 and your desktop
 but browsing photographs i think you can really enrich
 the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of you know  photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing i can toss these things around they 're so
 so much more tangible and and touchable and you know i can double click on something to take a look at it and i can do all that kind of same stuff i showed you before so i can pile things up 
 i can flip through it i can you know
 okay let 's move this this photo to the back let 's delete this guy here  and
 i think it 's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting
