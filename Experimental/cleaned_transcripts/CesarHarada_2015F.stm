  when i was a kid my parents would tell me you can make a mess  but you have to clean up after yourself 
 so freedom came with responsibility  but my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible 
  grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance i should say because
 adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth 
 and growing up i found out that adults make a mess and they 're not very good at cleaning up after themselves  
 fast forward i am an adult now  and i teach
  citizen science and invention at the hong kong harbour school  
 and it doesn 't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash 
 so as good citizens  we clean up the beaches and no he is not drinking alcohol  and if he is i did not
 give it to him 
 and so it 's sad to say but today more than eighty percent of the oceans have plastic in them it 's a horrifying fact 
 and in past decades we 've been taking those big ships out
  out and those big nets  and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope and we sort them and then we put this data onto a map  
 but that takes forever  it 's very expensive and so it 's quite risky to take those big boats out so with my students  ages six to
 fifteen  we 've been dreaming of inventing a better way  so we 've transformed our tiny hong kong classroom into a workshop  and so we started building
  this small workbench with different heights so even really short kids can participate  and let me tell you kids with power tools are awesome and safe 
 not really and
 so back to plastic we collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean which is very small because it breaks down  
 and so this is how we work i let the imaginations of my students run wild  and my job is to try
  to collect the best of each kid 's idea
 and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work  
 and so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits we are going to collect only the data so we 're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot so robots kids get very excited 
 and the next thing we do we do what
  we are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we 're hacking it and
 we hack table lamps and webcams into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there
 and this is the image that we get in the robot so we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor  
 and the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each
  particle  so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water  
 so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called instructables 
 in the hope that somebody would make it even better 
 what was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem  and boom they are trying to immediately address it
  students in hong kong are hyperconnected kids  and they watch the news they watch the internet  and they came across this image 
 this was a child probably under ten cleaning up an oil spill bare handed 
 in the sundarbans  which is the world 's largest mangrove forest in bangladesh  so they were very shocked
  because this is the water they drink this is the water they bathe in this is the water they fish in this is the place where they live 
 and also you can see the water is brown the mud is brown and oil is brown  so when everything is mixed up it 's really hard to see what 's in the water 
 but there 's a technology that 's rather simple that 's called spectrometry 
 that allows you see what 's in the water  so we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer  
 and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums  so that
  help you identify
 what 's in the water  
 so we packed this prototype of a sensor  and we shipped it to bangladesh  so what was cool about this project was that beyond
 addressing a local problem  or looking at a local problem my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help 
  i was very compelled by doing the second experiments and i wanted to take it even further maybe addressing an
 even harder problem  and it 's also closer to my heart  so i 'm half japanese and half french  and maybe you remember in two thousand and eleven
 there was a massive earthquake in japan  it was so violent that it triggered several giant waves they are called tsunami and those tsunami
  destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of japan  more than fourteen thousand people died in an instant 
 also it damaged the nuclear power plant of fukushima the nuclear power plant just by the water 
 and today i read the reports and an average of three hundred
 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant
  into the pacific ocean  and today the whole pacific ocean has traces of contamination of 
 if you go outside on the west coast you can measure fukushima everywhere  
 but if you look at the map  it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the japanese coast and most of it is now it looks like it 's safe it 's
  reality is a bit more complicated than this so i 've been going to fukushima every year since the accident  and i measure independently and with other scientists on land in the river
 and this time we wanted to take the kids  so of course we didn 't take the kids the parents wouldn 't allow that 
  but every night we would report to mission control different masks they 're wearing  it could look like they didn 't take the work seriously but
  they really did because they 're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life  and so what we did with them
 is that we 'd discuss the data we collected that day  and talk about where we should be going next strategy itinerary etc 
 and to do this we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear
  and so we built the elevation map  we sprinkled pigments to represent real time data for radioactivity  
 and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall 
 and with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system and leaking into the ocean  so it was a rough rough estimate  
 but with this in mind we organized this
  which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant  we are sailing
 one point five kilometers away from the nuclear power plant 
 and with the help of the local fisherman  we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we we 've invented and built 
 we pack the sediment into small bags
  we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities  
 and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity  especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce  
 that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi 
 you can see a progression here we 've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem 
 and it 's been super exciting to work at these different scales with also very simple
 technologies  but at the same time it 's been
 increasingly frustrating
 because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done  we haven 't even started to try to solve the problems  
 and so i wonder if we should just take a leap and try to
 invent better ways to do all these things  and so
 the classroom started to feel a little bit small so we found an industrial site in hong kong  and
  focused on social and environmental impact  it 's in central hong kong  and it 's a place we can work with wood metal  
 chemistry a bit of biology a bit of optics basically you can build pretty much everything there 
 and its a place where adults and kids can play together  
 it 's a place where kids  ' dreams can come true with the help of adults and where adults can be kids again
  future of mobility with renewable energy for example 
 or 
 can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool electric vehicles  
 so
 plastic oil and radioactivity are
  horrible legacies but the very worst legacy
 that we can leave our children is lies 
 we can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions  
 so
 citizen scientists  makers dreamers we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people 
 and that can actually do something about it
