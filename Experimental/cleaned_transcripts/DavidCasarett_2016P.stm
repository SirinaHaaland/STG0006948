  i would like to tell you about the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my years of working as a palliative care physician 
 this happened a couple of years ago  i was
  as a consultant to see a woman in her 70s retired english professor
 who had pancreatic cancer i was asked to see her because she had pain  nausea vomiting  
 when i went to see her we talked about those symptoms and in the course of that consultation she asked me whether i thought that medical marijuana might help her  
 i thought back to
  that i had learned in medical school about medical marijuana which didn 't take very long because i had learned absolutely nothing 
 and so i told her that as far as i knew medical marijuana had no benefits whatsoever  
 and she smiled and nodded and reached into the handbag next to the bed 
 and pulled out a stack of about a dozen randomized controlled trials showing that medical marijuana has benefits for symptoms like nausea and pain and anxiety
  she handed me those articles and said maybe you should read these before offering an opinion doctor 
 so i did that night i read all of those articles and found a bunch more when i came to see her the next morning 
 i had to admit that it looks like there is some evidence that marijuana can offer medical
  benefits and i suggested that if she really was interested she should try it you know what she said this
 retired english professor 
 she said i did try it about six months ago  it was amazing  i 've been using it every day since 
 it 's the best drug i 've discovered i don 't know why it took me seventy three years to discover this
  stuff it 's amazing 
 that was the moment at which i realized i needed to learn something about medical marijuana because what i was prepared for in medical school bore no relationship to reality 
 so i started reading more articles i started talking to researchers i started talking to doctors and most importantly i started
  ended up writing a book based on those conversations  and that book really revolved around three surprises surprises to me anyway  
 one i already alluded to that there really are some benefits to medical marijuana those benefits may not be as huge or as stunning as some of the most avid proponents of medical marijuana would have us believe but they are real 
 surprise number two medical marijuana does have some risks those risks may
  not be as huge and as scary as some of the opponents of medical marijuana would have us believe  but they are real risks nonetheless  
 but it was the third surprise that was most surprising  
 and that is that a lot of the patients i talked with who 've turned to medical marijuana for help  weren 't turning to medical marijuana because of its benefits or the balance of risks and benefits or because they thought it was a wonder drug
  but because it gave them control over their illness  it let them manage their health in a way that was productive
 and efficient and effective and comfortable for them 
 to show you what i mean let me tell you about another patient robin was in her early 40s when i met her she looked though like she was
  she had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for the last twenty years her hands were gnarled by arthritis her spine was crooked  she had to rely on a wheelchair to get around 
 she looked weak and frail  and i guess physically she probably was 
 but emotionally  cognitively psychologically  she was among the toughest people i 've ever met 
 and when i sat down next to her in a
  medical marijuana dispensary in northern california to ask her about why she turned to medical marijuana  what it did for her and how it helped her 
 she started out by telling me things that i had heard from many patients before  it helped with her anxiety  
 it helped with her pain  when her pain was better she slept better  and i 'd heard all that before but then she said something that i 'd never heard before  
 and that is that it gave her control over her life and over her health 
 she could use it when she wanted
  in the way that she wanted at the dose and frequency that worked for her and if it didn 't work for her then she could make changes everything was up to her the most important thing she said was she didn 't need anybody else 's permission
 not a clinic appointment not a doctor 's prescription not a pharmacist 's order  it was all up to her she was in control  
 and if that seems like a little thing for somebody with chronic illness
 not at all 
 when we face a chronic serious illness whether it 's rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or cancer or diabetes or cirrhosis  
 we lose control  
 and note what i said when not if all of us at some point in our lives will face a chronic serious illness that causes us to lose control we
 'll see our function decline some of us will see our
  cognition decline we 'll be no longer able to care for ourselves to do the things that we want to do our bodies will betray us 
 and in that process we 'll lose control  and that 's scary not
 just scary that 's frightening  it 's terrifying  
 when i talk to my patients my palliative care patients many of
  are facing illnesses that will end their lives they have a lot of be frightened of pain nausea vomiting  constipation fatigue their impending mortality but what scares them more than anything else
 is this possibility that at some point  tomorrow or a month from now they 're going to lose control of their health of their lives 
 of their healthcare and they 're going to become
  and that 's terrifying  
 so it 's no wonder really that patients like robin who i just told you about who
 i met in that clinic turn to medical marijuana to try to claw back some semblance of control how do they do it though how do these medical marijuana 
  dispensaries like the one where i met robin how do they give patients like robin back the sort of control that they need 
  a way that mainstream medical hospitals and clinics at least for robin weren 't able to what 's their secret  
 so i decided to find out 
 i went to a seedy clinic in venice beach in california and got a recommendation that would allow me to be a medical marijuana patient  
 i got a letter of recommendation that would let me buy medical marijuana  i got that recommendation
 illegally because i 'm not a resident of california i should note that 
 i should also note for the record that i never used that letter of recommendation to make a purchase and to all of you dea agents out there laughter
 love the work that you 're doing  keep it up 
 even though it didn 't let me make a purchase though that letter was priceless because it let me be a patient  it let me
  experience what patients like robin experience when they go to a medical marijuana dispensary 
 and what i experienced what they experience every day  hundreds of thousands of people like robin
 was really amazing  i walked into the clinic and from the moment that i entered many of these clinics and
  i felt like that dispensary that clinic was there for me 
 there were questions at the outset about who i am what kind of work i do  what my goals are
 in looking for a medical marijuana prescription  or
 product  what my goals are what my preferences are what my hopes are how do i think how do i hope this might help me  what am i afraid
  these are the sorts of questions that patients like robin get asked all the time these are the sorts of questions that make me confident that the person i 'm talking with really has my best interests at heart and wants to get to know me 
 the second thing i learned in those clinics
 is the availability of education education from the folks behind the counter but also education from folks in the waiting room 
 people i met were more than happy as i was sitting next to them people like robin
  to tell me about who they are why they use medical marijuana  what helps them how it helps them  and to give me advice and suggestions those waiting rooms really are a hive of interaction advice and support 
 and third the folks behind the counter  i was amazed at how willing those people were to spend sometimes an hour or more talking me through the nuances of
  this strain versus that strain smoking versus vaporizing edibles versus tinctures all  remember without me making any purchase whatsoever 
 think about the last time you went to any hospital or clinic and the last time anybody spent an hour explaining those sorts of things to you 
 the fact that patients like robin
 are going to these clinics are going to these dispensaries and
  getting that sort of personalized attention and education and service really should be a wake up call to the healthcare system  
 people like robin are turning away from mainstream medicine turning to medical marijuana dispensaries because those dispensaries are giving them what they need 
 if that 's a  wake up call to the medical
  call that many of my colleagues are either not hearing or not wanting to hear when i
 talk to my colleagues physicians in particular 
 about medical marijuana  they say oh we need more evidence we need more research into benefits we need more evidence about risks 
 and you know what they 're right they 're absolutely right  we do need much more evidence about the benefits of medical
  we also need to ask the federal government to reschedule marijuana to schedule ii or to deschedule it entirely to make that research possible  
 we also need more research into medical marijuana 's risks medical marijuana 's risks we know a lot about the risks of recreational use we know next to nothing about the risks of medical marijuana  
 so we absolutely do need research 
 but to say that we need research and not that we need to make any changes now is to miss the point
  entirely people like robin aren 't seeking out medical marijuana because they think it 's a wonder drug  or because they think it 's entirely 
  out because the context in which it 's delivered and administered and used gives them the sort of control they need over their lives  
 and that 's a  wake up call we really need to pay attention to 
 the good news though is that there are lessons we can learn
 today from those medical marijuana dispensaries 
 and those are lessons we really should learn these are often small mom and pop operations run by people with no medical training 
 and while it 's embarrassing to think that many of these clinics and dispensaries are providing services and support and meeting patients ' needs in ways that
  by that but we can also learn from that and there are probably three lessons at least that we can learn from those small dispensaries  
 one  we need to find ways to give patients more control in small but important ways how to interact with healthcare providers when to interact with healthcare providers  
 how to use medications in ways that work for them in my own practice i 've gotten much more creative and flexible
 in supporting my patients in using drugs safely to manage their symptoms with the emphasis on safely many of the drugs i prescribe are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines which can be dangerous if overused  but here 's the point 
 they can be dangerous if they 're overused  but they can also be ineffective if they 're not used in a way that 's consistent with what patients want and need so that flexibility if it 's delivered
  safely 
 can be extraordinarily valuable for patients and their families that 's number one number two education 
 huge opportunities to learn from some of the tricks of those medical marijuana dispensaries to provide more education that doesn 't require a lot of physician time necessarily or any physician time 
 but opportunities to learn about what medications we 're using and why prognoses  trajectories of
  illness  and most importantly opportunities for patients to learn from each other  
 how can we replicate what goes on in those clinic and medical dispensary waiting rooms how patients learn from each other how people share with each other  
 and last but not least putting patients first the way those medical marijuana dispensaries do 
 making patients feel legitimately like what they want
  they need is why as healthcare providers we 're here 
 asking patients about their hopes their fears their goals and preferences as a palliative care provider  i ask all my patients what they 're hoping for and what they 're afraid of 
 but here 's the thing patients shouldn 't have to wait until they 're chronically seriously ill often near
  have to wait until they 're seeing a physician like me before somebody asks them what are you hoping for what are you afraid of that should be baked into the way that healthcare is delivered 
 we can do this we really can medical marijuana dispensaries and clinics all across the country are figuring this out 
 they 're figuring this out in ways that
  more mainstream health systems are years behind but we can learn from them  and we have to learn from them all we have to do is swallow our pride
 put aside the thought for a minute that because we have lots of letters after our name because we 're experts because we 're chief medical officers of a large healthcare system  we know all there is to know about how to meet patients ' needs 
 we need to swallow our pride we need to go visit a
  we need to figure out what they 're doing  we need to figure out why so many patients like robin are leaving our mainstream medical clinics and going to these medical marijuana dispensaries instead  
 we need to figure out what their tricks are what their tools are and we need to learn from them 
 if we do and i think we can and i absolutely think we have to we can guarantee all of our patients will have a much better experience
