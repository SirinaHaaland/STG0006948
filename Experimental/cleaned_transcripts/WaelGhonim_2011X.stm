  this is revolution two point zero no one was a hero  no one was a hero because everyone was a hero  
 everyone has done something
  we all use wikipedia if you think of the concept of wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content and at the end of the day you 've built
 the largest encyclopedia in the world from just an idea that sounded crazy you have the largest encyclopedia in the world  
 and in the egyptian revolution the revolution two point zero  everyone has contributed something  small or big  they contributed something
 to bring us one of the most
  inspiring
 stories in the history of mankind
 when it comes to revolutions it
 was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing 
 if you look at the scene egypt for thirty years had been in a downhill
 going into a downhill everything was going
  everything was going wrong  we only ranked high when it comes to poverty  
 corruption  
 lack of freedom of speech  lack of political activism those were the achievements of our great regime 
 yet nothing was happening  and it 's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated in
  people were extremely frustrated  but the reason why everyone was silent
 is what i call the psychological barrier of fear 
 everyone was scared 
 not everyone there were actually a few brave egyptians that i have to to thank for being so brave going into protests as a couple of hundred getting beaten up and
 arrested  but in fact  the majority were scared
  did not want really to get in trouble 
 a dictator cannot live without the force they want to make people live in fear  
 and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years  
 and here comes the internet  technology  
 blackberry sms it 's helping all of us to connect
  platforms
  were helping us a lot
 because it basically gave us the impression that wow i 'm not alone  there are a lot of people who are frustrated there are lots of people who are frustrated  
 there are lots of people who actually share the same dream  
 there are lots of people who care about their freedom
  they probably have the best life in the world they are living in happiness they are living in their villas they are happy they don 't have problems  but they are still
 feeling the pain of the egyptian a lot of us
 we 're not really happy when we see a video of an egyptian man
 who 's eating the trash while others are stealing billions of egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country 
 the internet has played a great role helping these people to speak up their minds to collaborate together to start thinking together it was an
  khaled saeed was killed
 in june
 two thousand and ten
  i still remember the photo i still remember every single detail of that photo the photo was horrible 
 he was tortured brutally tortured to death  but then what was the answer of the regime he choked
 on a pile of hash
  that was their answer he 's a criminal he 's someone who escaped from all these bad things but people did not relate to this people did not believe this 
 because of the internet 
 the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth 
 and everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother he was a middle class guy  his photo was remembered by all of us 
 a page was created an anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page
 and there was no plan what are we going to do i don 't know in a few days tens of thousands of people there
 angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs enough 
 get those who killed this guy 
 to just bring them to justice 
  of course they don 't listen 
 it was an amazing story how everyone started feeling the ownership everyone was an owner in this page people started contributing ideas in fact 
 one of the most ridiculous ideas was 
 hey let 's have a silent stand  
 let 's get people to go in the street  face the sea their back to the to the street dressed in black standing up silently for one hour doing nothing and then just leaving going back home 
 for some people
  was like wow silent stand  and next time it 's going to be vibration 
 people were making fun of the idea but actually when people went to the street the first time it was thousands of people in alexandria
 it felt like it was amazing it was great because it connected people from the virtual world  bringing them to the real world  sharing
  the same dream the same frustration the same anger the same desire for freedom  and they were doing this thing but did the regime learn anything not really 
 they were actually attacking them they were actually abusing them despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were they were not even protesting 
 and things had developed until
 the tunisian revolution this whole
  the anonymous admin
 job was to collect ideas  help people to vote on them
 and actually tell them what they are doing  people were taking shots and photos people were reporting violations of human rights in egypt people were suggesting ideas  they were actually voting on ideas  and then they were executing the ideas
 people were creating videos everything was done by the people to the people and that 's the power of the internet  there was no leader
  the leader was everyone on that page  
 the tunisian experiment as amir was saying inspired all of us showed us that there is a way  yes we can we can do it we have the same problems  we can just go in the streets 
 and when i saw the street on the  25th 
 i went back and said egypt before the 25th is never going to be egypt after the 25th the revolution is happening this is not the
  end this is the beginning of the end 
 i was detained
 on the  27th night thank god i announced the locations and everything but they detained me
  and i 'm not going to talk about my experience because this is not about me  i was detained for twelve days blindfolded 
  and i did not really hear anything  i did not know anything  i was not allowed to speak with anyone  
 and i went out the next day i was in tahrir  
 seriously with the amount of change i had noticed in this square i thought it was twelve years  i never had in my mind
 to see this egyptian  the amazing egyptian 
 the fear is no longer fear it 's actually strength it 's power  people were so empowered it was amazing how
  everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights completely opposite  extremism became
 tolerance 
 who would [ have ] imagined before the 25th if i tell you that hundreds of thousands of christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of muslims are going to protect them and then hundreds of thousands of muslims 
  are going to pray and tens of thousands of christians are going to protect them this is amazing all the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put
  on us through their so called propaganda or mainstream media are proven wrong  
 this whole revolution showed us how ugly how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the egyptian man
  the egyptian woman how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a
  when i saw that 
 i went back and i wrote on facebook  
 and that was a personal belief  regardless of what 's going on  regardless of the details  i said that we are going to win  
 we are going to win because we don 't understand politics  we 're going to win
 because we don 't play their dirty games  we 're going to win because we don 't have an agenda we 're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes
 actually come from our hearts  we 're going to win
 because we have dreams  we 're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams 
 and that 's actually what happened  we won  and that 's not because of anything  but because we believed in our dream  
 the winning here is not the the whole details of what 's going to happen in the political scene the winning is the winning of
  the dignity of every single egyptian actually i had this taxi driver telling me 
 listen  i am breathing freedom  
 i feel that i have dignity that i have lost for so many years for me that 's winning  regardless of all the details 
 my last word to you is a statement i believe in which
 egyptians have proven to be true that the power of the people
  is much stronger than the people in power  thanks a lot
