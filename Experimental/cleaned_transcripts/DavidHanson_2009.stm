  i build robots with character and by that i mean that i develop robots that are characters  but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you
  so we 're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces  make eye contact with you make a full range of facial expressions 
  understand speech and begin to model how you 're feeling and who you are and build a relationship with you 
  range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face  running on very small batteries  extremely lightweight 
 the materials that allowed the  battery operated facial expressions is a material that we call frubber and it it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen one is hierarchical pores and the other is a macro molecular nanoscale porosity in the material
  this is at the korean advanced institute of science and technology i built the head they built the body  
 so the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines and not just sentience but empathy  
 we 're working with the machine perception laboratory at the u c san diego they have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions what facial expressions you 're making
  it also recognizes where you 're looking your head orientation we 're emulating all the major facial expressions  and then controlling it with the software that we call the character engine  and here is a little bit of the technology that 's involved in that
  so you smile frowning  so his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to to effectively become
  empathetic machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like
 killing right
  those machines have no place for empathy
  and there is billions of dollars being spent on that character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy so if they achieve human level intelligence or  
 quite possibly  greater than human levels of intelligence this could be the
 seeds of hope for our future
  made twenty robots in the last eight years during the course of getting my ph d and then i started hanson robotics which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing 
 this is one of our robots that we showed at wired nextfest a couple of years ago  and it sees multiple people in a scene remembers where individual people are  and looks from person to person 
  we 're involving two things one the perception of people  and two 
 the natural interface the natural form of the interface so that it 's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot you start to believe that it 's alive and aware  
 so one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display
 of an android portrait of science fiction writer philip  k dick who wrote great works like do androids dream of electric sheep
  basis of the movie bladerunner in these stories robots often think that they 're human and they sort of come to life so we put his writings letters 
 his interviews  
 correspondences into a huge database of thousands of pages  and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him and it was kind of spooky because he would say these things that
 just sounded like they really understood you and this is one of the most
  exciting projects that we 're developing which is a little character that 's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence friendly machine intelligence and we 're getting this 
  specked it out to actually be
 doable with a very very low cost bill of materials  so that it can become a childhood companion for kids interfacing with the internet it gets smarter over the years as artificial intelligence evolves  so does his intelligence
