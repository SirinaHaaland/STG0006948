  the last twenty years i 've been designing puzzles and i 'm here today to
 give you a little tour starting from the very first puzzle i designed through what i 'm doing now
  i 've designed puzzles for books  printed things i 'm the puzzle columnist for discover magazine i 've been doing that for about ten years i have a monthly puzzle calendar  i do toys the bulk of my work is in computer games i did puzzles for bejeweled 
 i didn 't invent bejeweled i can 't take credit for that so very first puzzle  sixth grade my teacher said 
 oh let 's see that guy he likes to make stuff i 'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the
  i thought this was a great assignment
  and so here is what i came up with i start fiddling with it i came up with this letter this is a letter of the alphabet that 's been folded just once
 the question is which letter is it if i unfold it one hint  it 's not
 yeah  so clever thing now  that was my first puzzle i got hooked  i created something new i was very excited because you know i 'd made crossword puzzles but that 's sort of like filling in somebody else 's matrix 
 this was something really original  i got hooked i read martin gardner 's columns in scientific american went on and eventually decided to devote myself full time to that 
  pause and say what do i mean by puzzle a puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve
 and has a right answer fun to solve as opposed to everyday problems which frankly are not very well designed puzzles you
 know they might have a solution it might take a long time nobody wrote down the rules clearly who
  life is not a very well written story so we have to hire writers to make movies 
 well i take everyday problems and i make puzzles out of them and right answer 
 of course there might be more than one right answer many puzzles have more than one but as opposed to a couple other forms of play toys and games by toy i mean 
 something you play with that doesn 't have a particular goal you can create one out of legos you know 
 you can do anything you want or competitive games like chess
 where well you 're not trying to solve
  you can make a chess puzzle  but the goal really is to
 beat another player  
 i consider that puzzles are an art form they 're very ancient it goes back as long as there is written history  it 's a very small form like a joke 
 a poem  a magic trick or a song very compact form 
 at worst  they 're throwaways they 're for
 for amusement but at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression 
 the progression of my career that you 'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact 
 so one thing i found early on when i started doing computer games is that i could create puzzles that will alter your perception i 'll show you how 
 here is a famous one so it 's two profiles in black or a white vase in the middle  this is called a figure ground illusion  the artist m c escher exploited that in some of his
 wonderful prints here we have
  day and night here is what i did with figure and ground 
 so here we have figure in black  here we have figure in white 
 and it 's all part of the same design 
 the background to one is the other originally i tried to do the words figure and ground but i couldn 't do that i realized i changed the problem  it 's all
 few other things here is my name  
 and that turns into the title of my first book inversions 
 these sorts of designs now go by the word ambigram i 'll
 show you just a couple others  here we have the numbers one through ten the
 digits zero through nine actually  each letter here is one of these digits not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense
  like pushing on what an ambigram can mean here 's the word mirror no it 's not the same upside down it 's the same this way 
 and a marvelous fellow from the media lab who just got appointed head of risd  is john maeda  and so i did this for him it 's sort of a visual canon
  in magic magazine i 've done a number of ambigrams on magician 's names  so here we have penn and teller 
 same upside down this appears in my
 my puzzle calendar  okay let 's go back to the slides thank you very much  now  those are fun to look at now how would you do it
 interactively for a while i was an interface designer and so i think a lot about interaction
  's first of all simplify the vases illusion make the thing on the right 
 now if you could pick up the black vase it would look like the figure on top 
 if you could pick up the white area it would look like the figure on the bottom  well  you can 't do that physically but on a computer you can do it let 's switch over to the p c 
 and
 here it 
 the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape
  on the right  and
 this follows the rules i just said  any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up  
 but that is also true of any white area so here we got the white area in the middle  and you can pick it up i 'll
 just go one step further so here is
 here is a couple pieces move them together and now this is an active
  you can really get inside somebody 's perception and
 have them experience something it 's like the old maxim of you can tell somebody something and show them but if they do it they really learn it 
 here is another thing you can do there is a game called rush hour  this is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides rubik 's cube 
 so here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place the goal is to get the red car out it 's a sliding block puzzle it 's made by the company think fun it 's done very well  i love this puzzle
 well let 's play one here so here is a very simple puzzle well that 's too simple let 's add another piece  
 okay so how would you solve this one well move the blue one out of the way here let 's make it a little harder  still pretty easy now we 'll make it harder a little harder  
 now this one is a little bit trickier you know what do you do here 
 the first move is going to be what 
  move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right  
 and you can make puzzles like this one that aren 't solvable at all those four are locked in a pinwheel  you can 't get them apart i wanted to make a sequel  i didn 't come up with the original idea but this is another way
 i work as an inventor is to
 create a sequel  i came up with this this is railroad rush hour it 's the same basic game except i introduced a new piece a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically in the other game the cars can only move forward and back 
 created a whole bunch of levels for it now
 i 'm making it available to schools  and it includes exercises that show you
 not just how to solve these puzzles but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or
 problems in science other areas so i 'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them garry trudeau calls himself an
  he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon in discover magazine i 'm an investigative puzzle maker  
 i got interested in gene sequencing and i said well how on earth can you come up with a sequence of
 the base pairs in dna 
 cut up the dna  you sequence individual pieces and then you look for overlaps and you basically match them at the edges and i said this is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle 
 except the pieces overlap so here is what i created for discover magazine  
 and it has to be solvable in a magazine
  cut out the pieces and move them around so 
 here is the nine pieces and you 're supposed to put them into this grid  and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge there is only one solution it 's not that hard but it takes some persistence 
  and when you 're done it makes this design which if you squint is the word helix 
  that 's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content rather than the other way around 
 here is a couple more here is a physics based puzzle which way will these fall one of these weighs fifty pounds thirty pounds and ten pounds and depending on which one weighs which amount they 'll fall different directions  
 and here is a puzzle based on color mixing i separated this image into cyan magenta yellow black  the basic printing colors and then mixed up the separations  and you get these peculiar pictures  which separations were mixed up to make those pictures gets you thinking about color
  finally what i 'm doing now
 website you can go visit i joined up with my wife amy jo kim she could easily be up here giving
 a talk about her work so we 're making smart games for social media i 'll explain what that means we 're looking at three trends  this is
 what 's going on in the games industry right now first
  you know for a long time computer games meant
 things like doom where you 're going around shooting things very violent games very fast aimed at teenage boys right  that 's who plays computer games well guess what that 's changing 
 bejeweled is a big hit  it was the game that really broke open what 's called casual games 
 and the main players are over thirty five and are female 
 then recently rock band has been a big hit  and it 's a game you play with other people it 's very physical it looks nothing like a traditional game this is
 what 's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming 
 now within that there is some interesting things happening 
 there is also a trend towards games that are good for you why well we aging boomers   baby boomers we 're eating our healthy food we 're exercising what about our minds  oh no 
 our parents are getting alzheimer 's we better do something turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of alzheimer 's so we got games like brain age
  age coming out for the nintendo ds huge hit a lot of people do sudoku in fact some doctors prescribe it 
 and then there is social media and what 's happening on the internet everybody now considers themselves a creator and not just
 a viewer and what does this add up to 
 here is what we see coming  it 's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle they 're part of your life they 're not necessarily a separate thing
  and they are both something that is good for you and they 're fun i 'm a
 puzzle guy my wife is an expert in social media and we decided to combine our skills our first game is called photo grab the game takes about a minute and twenty seconds this is your first time playing my game okay let 's see how well we can do there are three images  
 and we have twenty four seconds each where is that i
 'll play as fast as i can but if you can see it shout out the answer
  you get more down  okay  yeah where is that  oh yeah 
  i guess that 's that part we got the bow that bow helps  that 's his hair you get a lot of figure ground problems
  yeah that one is easy okay so ahhh okay on to the next one okay so that 's the lens
  that that 's the corner
 of the whole thing 
 yeah i 've played this image before but even when i make up my my own puzzles and you can put your own images in here and we have people all over the world doing that now
