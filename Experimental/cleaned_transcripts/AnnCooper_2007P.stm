  my thing with school lunch is it 's a social justice issue  i 'm the director of nutrition services for the berkeley unified school district i have ninety employees and seventeen locations nine thousand six hundred kids i 'm doing seven thousand one hundred meals a day
 and i 've been doing it for two years trying to change how we feed kids in america and
  and that 's what i want to talk to you a little bit about today these are some of my kids with a salad bar i put salad bars in all of our schools when i got there everyone says it couldn 't be done little kids couldn 't eat off the salad 
  bar big kids would spit in it neither happened when i took over this i tried to really figure out like what my vision would be how do we really change children 's relationship to food and i 'll tell you why we need to change it but we absolutely have to change it and what i came to understand
  is we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet healthy food and healthy kids and that if we don 't do that the antithesis 
 although we 've heard otherwise is we 're really going to become extinct because we 're feeding our children to death that 's my premise we 're seeing sick kids get sicker and
  and the reason this is happening by and large is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food the way the government oversees our food  the way the
 usda puts food on kids ' plates that 's unhealthy and allows unhealthy food into schools and by tacitly all of us send our kids or grandchildren or nieces or 
  nephews to school and tell them to learn  you know learn what 's in those schools and when you feed these kids bad food that 's what they 're learning so that 's really what this is all about
 the way we got here is because of big agribusiness  we now live in a country where most of us don 't decide by and large what we eat we see big businesses 
 monsanto and dupont who brought out agent orange and stain resistant carpet they control ninety percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country these are ten companies
  really a problem  so when i started thinking about these issues and how i was going to change what kids ate i really started focusing on what we would teach them  and the very first thing was 
  about regional food trying to eat food from within our region and clearly with what 's going on with fossil fuel usage or when as the fossil fuel is going
  oil hits its peak oil  you know we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should or could be moving food one thousand five hundred miles before we eat it 
  so we talked to kids about that and we really start to feed kids regional food and then we talk about organic food now most school districts can 't really afford organic food  but we 
 as a nation have to start thinking about consuming growing and feeding our children food that 's not chock full of chemicals we can 't keep feeding our
  kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones we can 't keep doing that you know it doesn 't work  and the results of that are kids getting sick 
  one of my big soapboxes soapboxes right now is antibiotics seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in america is consumed in animal husbandry  we are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein
 every day  seventy percent it 's unbelievable  and the result of it is we have diseases
 we have things like e coli that we can 't fix that we can 't make kids better when they get sick and you know certainly antibiotics have been 
 but it 's an issue in the food supply  one of my favorite facts is that u s agriculture uses one point two billion pounds of
  pesticides every year that means every one of us and our children consumes what would equal a five pound bag those bags you have at home if i had one here and ripped it open 
  and that pile i would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply because of the way we
  allows these antibiotics these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply and the usda paid for this ad in time magazine okay we could talk about rachel carson and ddt 
  but we know it wasn 't good for you and me  and that is what the usda allows in our food supply  and that has to change you know  the usda cannot be seen as the
  of what we feed our kids and what 's allowed we cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart  the antithesis of this whole thing
 is sustainable food  that 's what i really try and get people to understand i really try and teach it to kids i think it 's the most important it 's consuming food in a way
  in which we 'll still have a planet  in which kids will grow up to be healthy and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we 're seeing 
  sustainability  but we have to figure out what sustainability is  in less than two hundred years you know just in a few generations we 've gone from being two hundred
 being one hundred percent ninety five percent farmers to less than two percent of farmers we now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers two point one million prisoners one point nine million farmers  
 and we spend thirty five thousand dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison and
  school districts spend five hundred dollars a year feeding a child it 's no wonder  you know we have criminals 
 and what 's happening is we 're getting sick  we 're getting sick and our kids are getting sick 
 it is about what we feed them what goes in is what we are we really are what we eat and if we continue down this
  path if we continue to feed kids bad food if we continue not to teach them what good food is 
 what 's going to happen  you know what is going to happen what 's going to happen to our whole medical system what 's going to happen is 
 we 're going to have kids
 that have a life less long than our own 
  the cdc the center for disease control has said of the children born in the year two thousand those seven and  eight year olds today one out of every three caucasians one out of every 
  two african americans and hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime 
  within a decade  
 what 's going to happen  well the cdc has gone further to say that those children born in the year two thousand could be the first generation in our country 's history to 
  die at a younger age than their parents and it 's because of what we feed them because 
  we are responsible for what kids eat  
 but oops  maybe they 're responsible for what kids eat 
 big companies spend twenty billion dollars a year marketing non nutrient foods to kids  twenty billion dollars a year ten thousand ads most kids see 
 they spend five hundred dollars for every one dollar five hundred dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn 't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy nutritious food  the result of which is
  kids think they 're going to die if they don 't have chicken nuggets  you know that everybody thinks they should be eating more and more and more this is the usda portion size that little tiny thing and the one over there that 's bigger than my head 
 is what mcdonald 's and burger king and those big companies think we should eat and why can they serve that much why can we have
  cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non nutrient foods really really cheap which is why i say it 's a social justice 
  issue  now i said i 'm doing this in berkeley and you might think oh berkeley of course you can do it in berkeley well this is the food i found twenty four months ago this is not even food this is the stuff we were feeding our kids extremo burritos corn dogs 
  grilled cheese sandwiches everything came in plastic in cardboard the only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter the only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can 
  crusher because if it didn 't come in a can it came frozen in a box the usda allows this the usda allows all of this stuff in case you can 't tell that 's like pink danish and some kind of cupcakes chicken nuggets
  tater tots chocolate milk with high fructose canned fruit cocktail a reimbursable meal that 's what the government says is okay to feed our kids  
 it ain 't okay  you know what it is not okay  and we all of us have to understand
 that this is about us that we can make a
  any of you out there invented chicken nuggets but i 'm sure you 're rich if you did  but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart 
 a giraffe a star  well tyson did  because there 's no chicken in the chicken  and that they could figure it out that we could sell this stuff to kids  you know what 's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken 
 but this is what most schools
  in fact this may be what a lot of parents serve as opposed to this is what we try and serve  
 we really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food we really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe  
 you know that vegetables
 are actually colorful that they have flavor that carrots grow in the ground  that
 strawberries grow in the ground there 's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush  
 you know we have to change the way we teach kids about these things there 's a lot of stuff we can do there 's a lot of schools doing farm to school programs 
  there 's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools  now in berkeley  we 've gone totally fresh  we have no high fructose corn syrup no trans fats no processed 
  foods we 're cooking from scratch every day we have twenty five percent of our
 thank you
 twenty five percent of our stuff is organic and local we cook those are my hands i get up at four a m every day and go cook the food for the kids 
  because this is what we need to do we can 't keep serving kids processed
  the generation after to be able to think like this if they 're not nourished if they 're eating
 eating chemicals all the time they 're not going to be able to think they 're not going to be smart  you know what they 're just going to be sick  
 now one of the things that what happened when i went into berkeley is i realized that you know this was all pretty amazing
  very different and i needed to market it i came up with these calendars that i sent home to every parent and these calendars really started to lay out my program now i 'm in charge of all the cooking classes and 
  all the gardening classes in our school district  so this is a typical menu this is what we 're serving this week at the schools and you see these recipes on the side those are the recipes that the kids learn 
  in my cooking classes they do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes they also may be growing them  and we serve them in the cafeterias
  we 're going to change children 's relationship to food it 's delicious nutritious food in the cafeterias hands on experience you 're looking in cooking and gardening classes and academic curriculum to tie it all together  
 now you 've probably garnered that i don 't love the usda and i don 't have any idea what to do with their pyramid this upside down pyramid with a rainbow over the top i
  run up into the end of the rainbow i don 't know what you do with it so i came up with my own this is available on my website in english and spanish and it 's a visual way to talk to kids about food  the really tiny hamburger 
 the really big vegetables  we have to start changing this  we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference 
  maybe two of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer 
 what are kids learning where is the family time where is socialization where is discussion where is learning to
  we have to change it i work with kids a lot these are kids i work with in harlem  eatwise enlightened and aware teens who inspire smart eating  we have to teach kids that coke and pop tarts aren 't breakfast  
 we have to teach kids that if they 're on a diet of refined sugar  they go up and
 down just like if they 're on a diet of crack  and we have to pull it all together
  have composting in all of our schools we have recycling in all of our schools  you know the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important  
 we have to teach kids about in school 
 it has to be so much a part of them that they really get it because you know what many of us are sort of at the end of our careers  and we need to be 
 giving these kids these young kids the next generation the tools to save themselves and save the planet  one of the things i do a lot is
 public private partnerships  i work with private companies who are willing to do r & d with me  who are willing to do distribution for me  who are really willing to work to go into schools schools are underfunded 
 most schools in america spend less than seven thousand five hundred dollars a year teaching a child that comes down to under five dollars an hour most of you spend
  fifteen dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them  so we 're spending less than five dollars an hour on the educational system and if we 're going to change it and change how we feed 
  kids we really have to rethink that so public and private partnerships advocacy groups working with foundations in our school district the way we afford this is our school district allocates 
  percent of the general fund towards nutrition services and i think if every school district allocated a half to one
  percent we could start to really fix this program  we really need to change it it 's going to take more money 
 of course it 's not all about food it 's also about kids getting exercise and one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch  it 's sort of this duh 
  thing you know if you have kids coming into lunch and all they 're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess you see them just throw away their lunch
  can run outside and then at one in the afternoon they 're totally crashing these are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up because they haven 't had lunch 
 so if the only thing they 'd have to do after lunch is go to class believe me they 're going to sit there and eat their lunch  
 we need to we need to
 educate we need to educate the kids we
  the staff i had ninety employees two were supposed to be cooks none could  and you know i 'm not that better
 better off now  but we really have to educate we have to get
 academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again because of course they don 't because we 've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long 
 we need 40 minute lunches most
  there was just a big study done and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and ten in the morning  that is not lunchtime
  you know it 's crazy  it 's crazy what we 're doing and just remember at very least tacitly 
 this is what we 're teaching children as what they should be doing  
 i think if we 're going to fix
 one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the national school lunch program instead of the national school lunch program being under the usda i think it should be under cdc if we started to think about food
 and how we feed our kids as a health initiative  
 and we started thinking about food as health then i think we wouldn 't have corn dogs
 as lunch
  this and this i 'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece because i think this is something we all have to understand the national school lunch program spends eight billion dollars feeding thirty million children 
  a year that number probably needs to double people say oh my god where are we going to get eight billion in this country we 're spending one hundred and ten billion dollars a year
  aids  we spend fifty billion dollars on vegetables which is why we need all the diet aids  
 we spend two hundred billion dollars a year on diet related illness today with nine percent of our kids having type two diabetes two hundred billion 
 so you know what when we talk about needing eight billion more  it 's not a lot that eight billion comes down to two dollars and
  cents that 's what the government allocates for lunch most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead  that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools most schools eighty to ninety cents in 
  cents  so we 're spending less than a dollar ok on lunch now i don 't know
  but i go to starbucks and pete 's and places like that and venti latte in san francisco is five dollars one gourmet coffee one 
 is more we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week
 in our schools  you know what we should be ashamed 
 we as a country should be ashamed
 at that the richest country in
  country  it 's the kids that need it the most 
 who get this really really lousy food it 's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can 't even afford
 to pay for school lunch that gets this food and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick 
  those are the same kids who we should be taking care of
