  most people don 't know that when i went to high school in this country
 i
 applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculptor  
 and i came from a very privileged background i was very lucky my family was wealthy
 and my father believed in one
  thing and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted and i announced i wanted to be a sculptor in paris  
 and he was a clever man he sort of said well that 's ok but you 've done very well in your math sats in fact i 'd got an eight hundred 
 and he thought i did very well and i did too in the arts this was my passion  and he said if
  you go to mit to which i had been given early admission 
 i will pay for every year you 're at mit  in graduate or undergraduate as much as you want i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris 
 and i thought that was the best deal in town so i accepted it immediately  
 and i decided that if i was good in art and i was good in mathematics i 'd study architecture which was the blending of the two i went and told my headmaster that 
  and i said to him what i was doing that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and and mathematics put together
 he said to me something that just went completely over my head he said you know 
 i like grey suits  and i like pin striped suits  but i don 't like grey pin striped suits 
 and i thought what a turkey this guy is and
 i went off to mit i studied architecture then did a second degree in architecture and then actually
  quickly realized that it wasn 't architecture that really the mixing of art and and science was computers  
 and that that really was the the place to bring both and enjoyed a a career doing that 
 and probably if i were to fill out jim citrin 's
  put one hundred percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative 
 and after doing this for a long time and the media lab passing the baton on i thought well maybe it 's time for me to do a project 
 something that would be
 important  but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had and in the case of the media lab  knowing a lot of people  knowing
 people who
  were either executives or wealthy and also not having in my own case a career to worry about anymore my career i mean i 'd done my career didn 't have to worry 
  about earning money didn 't have to worry about what people thought about me  and i said boy let 's really do something that takes advantage of all these features and thought that if we could address education by leveraging the children 
 to the world the access of the computers that that was really the thing we should do never shown this picture before and probably going to be sued for it it 's taken at three o 'clock 
  in the morning without the permission of the company it 's about two weeks old there they are folks 
  those are conveyor belts that go around  this is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by but then you 'll see the ones up above what happens is they burn 
 into flash memory the software and then test them for a few hours but you 've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line because it 's constant so they go around in this loop which is why you see them
 up there so this was great for
  a real turning point but it goes back this picture was taken in 
  just before the ibm pc was even announced seymour papert and i were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself but 
 one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here and when people tell me who 's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids i say to myself what planet do you come from
 's not a person in this room i don 't care how techie you are there 's not a person in this room that doesn 't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it  ok we all all need help
  even those of us who are very seasoned this picture of seymour twenty five years ago
  seymour made a very
  seventy april eleven to be precise called teaching children thinking what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently  and when they debug 
  the programs they come the closest to learning about learning that was very important and in some sense we 've lost that 
  anything i hope this brings back  it 's programming to kids it 's really important using applications is ok  but programming is absolutely fundamental 
  this is being launched with three languages in it squeak logo  and a third that i 've never even seen before the point being this is going to be very very intensive on the programming side this photograph is very important because it 's much later
  my son dimitri who 's here  many of you know dimitri went to cambodia  set up this school that we had built just as the school connected it to the internet and these kids
 had their laptops but it was really what spirited this plus the influence of joe and others  
 we started one laptop per child this is the same village in cambodia just
  of months ago these kids are real pros 
 there were just seven thousand machines out there being tested by kids being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental  
 everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit but they were all wrong  
 and the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold there are many reasons but the two that merit the little bit of time is one  
 the clarity of purpose is there the moral purpose is clear i can see any head of state any executive
  i want at any time because i 'm not selling laptops  
 ok i have no shareholders  whether we sell it doesn 't make any difference whatsoever  the clarity of purpose is absolutely critical  and the second is
 very counterintuitive you can get the best people in the world
  if you look at our professional services including search firms  including communications including legal services
  banking they 're all pro bono  and it 's not to save money we 've got money in the bank  
 it 's because you get the best people you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission  and they 're the best people
 we couldn 't afford to hire a cfo  we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary and we had a queue
  of people 
 it allows you to team up with people the u n ' s not going to be our partner if we 're profit making so announcing this with kofi annan was very important  and the u n allowed us
 to to basically reach all the countries and this was the machine we were showing before i met yves behar  
  crank it 's different it was getting its power in a different way it 's kind of childlike even though this wasn 't the direction we went
 because the crank it really is stupid to have it on board by the way  in spite of what some people in the press don 't get it didn 't understand it we didn 't take it off because we didn 't want to 
  do having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want you want a separate thing like the ac adaptor i didn 't bring one with me but
 they really work much better off board and then i could tell you lots about the laptop but i decided on just four things 
 just keep in mind because there are other people including bill gates who said gee you 've got a real computer that computer is unlike anything you 've had and does 
  things there are four of them that you don 't come close to and it 's very important to be low power and i hope that 's picked up more by the industry
  you want to be below two watts is that 's roughly what you can generate with your upper body
 dual mode display that sunlight display 's fantastic we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight and the more sunlight the better and that was really critical the mesh network it 'll become commonplace 
 and of course rugged goes without saying and the reason i think design matters isn 't because i wanted to go to art school and by the way when i graduated from mit i thought the worst and silliest thing to
  would be to go to paris for six years so i didn 't do that but
 design matters for a number of reasons the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap 
 design cheap labor cheap components and making a cheap laptop and in
  has a double meaning which is really appropriate because it 's cheap in the pejorative sense as well as inexpensive 
 but if you take a different approach and you think of very large scale integration very advanced materials very advanced manufacturing so you 're pouring chemicals in one end ipods are spewing 
  out the other and really cool design that 's what we wanted to do and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn 't
 compare notes these are his slides and
 so i don 't have to talk about them but
 it was really to us very important as a strategy it wasn 't just to kind of make it cute because somebody you know 
 good design is very important yves showed one of the the
 power generating devices  the mesh network the reason i i and i won 't go into it in great
 detail but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and
 poorest parts of the world they 're connected there 's not just laptops and so we have to drop in satellite dishes we put in generators it 's a lot of stuff that goes behind these these can talk to each other 
 if you 're in a desert  they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart if you 're in the jungle it 's about five hundred meters so if a kid bicycles home or walks a few miles 
 they 're going to be off the grid so to speak they 're not going to be near another laptop so you have to nail these onto a tree
 and sort of get it you don 't call verizon or sprint you build your own network  and that 's very important the user interface  
 we are launching with eighteen keyboards  english is by far the minority latin is relatively rare too you just look at some of the languages i 'm willing to suspect
 some of you hadn 't even heard of them before is there anybody in the room one person unless you work with olpc is there anybody in the
  room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that 's on the screen  
 there 's only one hand so you get it
 yes you 're right he 's right it 's amharic it 's ethiopian in ethiopia there 's never been a keyboard  there is no keyboard standard because there 's no market and
 this is the big difference again when you 're a nonprofit you look at children as a mission not as a market
  we went to ethiopia  and we helped them make a keyboard and this will become the standard ethiopian keyboard  
 so what i want to end with is sort of what we 're doing to roll it out and we changed strategy completely i decided at the beginning it was a
 pretty good thing to decide in the beginning it 's not what we 're doing now is to go to six countries 
 big countries one of them is not so big but it 's rich here 's the six we went to the six and in each case the head of state said
 he would do it he 'd
 do a million in the case of gaddafi he 'd do one point two million  and that they would launch it  we thought this is exactly the right strategy get it out and then the little countries could 
  sort of piggyback on these big countries and so i went to each of those countries at least six times met with the head of state probably two or three times in each case
  got the ministers went through a lot of the stuff this was a period in my life where i was traveling three hundred and thirty days per year  not something you 'd envy or want to do in the case of libya 
 it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent the camel smells were unbelievable and it was forty five degrees c i mean this was not what you 'd call a cool experience and
  a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity make a press release so we went to smaller ones uruguay bless their hearts small country not so rich president said he 'd do it and guess what he did do it the
 tender had nothing in it that related to us nothing specific about 
 but just a vanilla laptop proposal and guess what we won it hands down when it was announced that they were going to do every child in uruguay the first one hundred thousand boom went to olpc the next day
  day
 the next day not even twenty four hours had passed in peru the president of peru said we 'll do two hundred and fifty and boom a little domino effect the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it the president of ethiopia 
  said he would do it and boom boom boom the president of mongolia  and so what happens is these things start to happen with these countries
  all those countries it didn 't quite get to thing so we said let 's start a program in the united states 
 so end of august early september  we decide to do this we announced it near the middle end just when the clinton initiative was taking place we thought that was a good 
  time to announce it launched it on the twelve of november we said it would be just for a short period until the twenty six we 've extended it until the
  give one get one program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested the first day it was just
 wild and then we said well  let 's get people to give many 
 not just one and get one  but maybe give one hundred give one thousand and that 's where you come in and that 's where i think it 's very important 
 i don 't want you all to go out and buy four hundred dollars worth of laptops
 if everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for four hundred dollars whatever it is three hundred people in the room doing it yeah great i want you do something else  
 and it 's not to go out and buy one hundred or one thousand though i invite you to do that and ten thousand would be even better 
 tell people about it it 's got to become
  use your mailing lists people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists  get your friends to give one get one and if each one of you sends it to three hundred or four hundred people that would be fantastic  
 i won 't dwell on the pricing
 at all just to say that when you do the give one get one a lot of press is a bit about they didn 't make it it 's one hundred and eighty eight dollars
 it 's not one hundred it will be one hundred in two years it will go below one hundred we 've pledged not to add features
  features but to bring that price down  but it was the countries that wanted it to go up  and we let them push it up for for all sorts of reasons so what you can do i 've just said it don 
  't just give one get one  i just want to end with one last one  this one is not even 24 hours old or maybe it 's 24 hours the first kids got their laptops  they got them by ship and i 'm talking now about seven thousand eight thousand at a time
  they went to uruguay 
 peru  mexico  and it 's been slow coming and we 're only making about five thousand a week but we hope we hope sometime in next year  maybe by the middle of the year to hit a million a month 
 now put that number and a million isn 't so much it 's not a big
  selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year but a million a month in 
  a big number  
 and the world production today everybody combined making laptops is five million a month  
 so i 'm standing here telling you that sometime next year we 're going to make twenty percent of the world production 
 and if we do that there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there  and we hope
 if you have eg two years from now or whenever you have it again
  i won 't have bad breath  and i will be invited back  and will have hopefully by then maybe one hundred million out there to children
