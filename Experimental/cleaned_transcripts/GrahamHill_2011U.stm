  what 's in the box  whatever it is must be pretty important because i 've traveled with it moved it from apartment
  you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did fifty years ago three times 
 so you 'd think with all this extra space we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff
  two point two billion sq ft industry that of personal storage  so we 've got triple the space but we 've become such good shoppers
 that we need even more space  
 so where does this lead  lots of credit card debt  huge environmental footprints and perhaps
  over the same fifty years  well i 'm here to suggest there 's a better way that less might actually equal more 
 i bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less 
 college
 in your dorm 
 traveling in a hotel room  camping rig up basically nothing maybe a boat  
 whatever it was for you i bet that among other things this gave you a little more freedom
 a little more time  
 so i 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint it 's actually a great way to save you some money and it 's going to give you a little more ease in your life  
 so i started a project called life edited at 
 to further this conversation and to find some
  i wanted it all
 home office sit down dinner for ten 
 room for guests and all my kite surfing gear with over three hundred entries from around the world i got it my own little jewel box  
 by buying a space that was four hundred and twenty sq ft instead of six hundred immediately
 i 'm saving two hundred grand 
 smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities save some more money there  
 but also a smaller footprint 
 and because it 's really designed around an edited set of possessions my favorite stuff and really designed for me i 'm really excited to be there  
 so how can you live
  to edit ruthlessly we 've got to clear the arteries of our lives and that shirt
 that i hadn 't worn in years it
 's time for me to let it go 
 we 've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives  and we 've got to learn to stem the inflow we
 need to think before we buy ask ourselves is that really going to make me happier  
  by all means  we should buy and own some great stuff but we want stuff that we 're going to love for years not just stuff  
 secondly our new mantra  small is sexy  
 we want space efficiency we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time 
 not that rare event  
 why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three 
 so we want things that nest we want things that stack
  we want it digitized you can take paperwork books  movies  
 and you can make it disappear it 's magic  finally we want multifunctional spaces and housewares
 a sink combined with a toilet a dining table becomes a bed same space a little side table stretches out to seat ten 
 in the winning life edited scheme in a render here
  we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space  look at the coffee table
 it grows in height and width to seat ten  
 my office folds away  easily hidden  my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers guests  move the moving wall
  guest beds and of course my own movie theater  
 so i 'm not saying that we all need to live in four hundred and twenty sq ft but consider the benefits of an edited life 
 go from three thousand to two thousand from one thousand five hundred to one thousand 
 most of us maybe all of us are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags maybe a small space a hotel room  
 so when you go home and you walk through your front door take a second and ask yourselves
 could i do with a little life editing  would that give me a little more freedom  maybe a little more time 
 what 's in the box it doesn 't really matter i know i don 't need it 
 what 's in yours  
  just maybe less might equal more so let 's make room for the good stuff
