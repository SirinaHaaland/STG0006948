  i wrote this poem after hearing a
 pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television i 'm really getting into the internet lately  i just wish it were more organized
  controlled the internet  
 you could auction your broken heart on ebay  
 take the money go to amazon  buy a phonebook for a country you 've never been to call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language 
 if i were in charge of the internet you could mapquest your lover 's
  hang left at cranky  right at preoccupied u turn on silent treatment all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin ' you could navigate and understand every 
  emotional intersection some days i 'm as shallow as a baking pan but i still stretch miles in all directions if i owned the internet napster 
  would be one big
 big website that way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you 're really just chattin ' with your pals heck if i ran the web
  you could email dead people 
 laughter they would not email you back but
 you 'd get an automated reply their name in your inbox it 's all you wanted anyway
  you 'll see being dead is dandy  now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy if i designed the internet 
 would be a loop of a boy in an orchard  with a ski pole for a sword  trashcan lid for a shield shouting i am the emperor of
  who downloads the boy in the orchard the emperor of oranges who grows up to be
 me the guy who usually goes too far so if i were
  emperor of the internet  i guess i 'd still be mortal 
 huh but at that point i would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis so i would 
 outlaw spam on my first day in office  i wouldn 't need it i 'd be like some kind of internet genius and me
  google would hire this i could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the world wide web is as wise 
 as wild and as organized as i think a modern day miracle oracle can get but ooh eee you want to bet
 just how whack and and un pc your mac or pc is going to be when i 'm rocking
  it is not a question of if you can
 it 's do ya  
 we can interfere with the interface we can make you 've got hallelujah the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on  you don 't say a prayer  you don 't write a psalm you don 't chant an om 
 you send one blessed email to
 whomever you 're thinking of at
