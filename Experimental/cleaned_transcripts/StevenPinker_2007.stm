  images like this from the auschwitz concentration camp have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century
 and have given us a new understanding of
 who we are where we 've come from and the times we live in
  the twentieth century  
 we witnessed the atrocities of stalin hitler mao  pol pot rwanda and other genocides 
 and even though the twenty first century is only seven years old we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in darfur and the daily horrors of iraq 
 this has led to a common understanding of our situation namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence
  violence and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from to our peril
 here is an example from an op ed on thanksgiving in the boston globe a couple of years ago  where the writer wrote the indian life was a difficult one but there were no employment problems community harmony was
  what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter now you 're all familiar with this
 treacle we teach it to our children
 we hear it on television and in storybooks now  
 the original title of this session was everything you know is wrong and i 'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong that in fact our ancestors
  were far more violent than we are that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species ' existence 
 now in the decade of darfur and iraq a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene  but i 'm going to try to convince
  the decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon you can see it over millennia over centuries over decades and over years  
 although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the age of reason in the sixteenth century  
 one sees it all over the world  although not homogeneously 
 it 's especially evident in the west beginning with england and holland around the time of the enlightenment  let me
  take you on a journey of several powers of ten from the millennium scale to the year scale to try to persuade you of this until ten thousand years ago all humans lived as 
 without permanent settlements or government and this is the state that 's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony but the
  which is our best source of evidence about this way of life has shown a rather different conclusion here is a graph that he
 put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging or hunting and gathering societies  
 the red bars correspond to the
 likelihood that a man
  will
 die at the hands of another man as opposed to passing away of natural causes  in a variety of foraging societies in the new guinea highlands and the amazon rainforest  
 and they range from a rate of almost a sixty percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to in the case of the gebusi only a fifteen percent
  the tiny little blue bar in the lower left hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from united states and europe in the twentieth century and
 includes all the deaths of both world wars if the death rate in tribal warfare
 had prevailed during the 20th century  there would have been two billion deaths rather than one hundred million also at the millennium scale  we can
  look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the bible  and in this
 supposed source of our moral values  one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare such as the following from numbers thirty one 
 and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded moses and they slew all the males  and moses said unto them ' have you saved all the women alive
  every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him  but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves ' in other words kill the men 
 kill the
 the children if you see any virgins then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them you can find four or five passages in the bible
 of this ilk also
  one sees that the death penalty was the
 accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality  adultery  blasphemy idolatry talking back to your parents and picking up sticks on the sabbath  
 well let 's
 click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude and look at the century scale   
 although we don 't have statistics for warfare throughout the middle ages to modern times we know just from conventional history
 the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence for example any
 social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment the kind of infraction today that would give you a fine in those days would result in your
 tongue being cut out your ears being cut off you being blinded a hand being chopped off and so on there were
 numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment burning at the stake disemboweling breaking on the wheel being pulled apart by horses and so on 
 the death penalty was a
 sanction for a long list of non violent crimes criticizing the king stealing a loaf of bread slavery of course was the preferred
  a popular form of entertainment perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning  in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire  and the 
 spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat howling in pain was burned to death 
  the
 criminologist manuel eisner
 scoured all of the historical records across europe for homicide rates in any village  hamlet town county that he could find and he supplemented them with 
  national data when nations started keeping statistics he plotted on a logarithmic scale
  from one hundred deaths per one hundred thousand
 people per year which was approximately the
 rate of homicide in the middle ages  and the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per one hundred thousand people per year in
 seven or eight european countries then there is a slight uptick in the
  the people who said that rock ' n ' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually
 had a grain of truth to that but there was a decline from
 at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the middle ages to the present and the elbow occurred in the
 early sixteenth century  let 's click down now to the decade scale according to non governmental organizations that keep such statistics
  in europe and the americas there has been a steep decline in interstate wars  in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms  and in military coups even in south america  worldwide  there 's been a steep decline in deaths in
 interstate wars  the yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from one thousand nine hundred and fifty to the present
 and as you can see the death rate goes down from
  deaths per conflict per year in 
 to less than two thousand deaths per conflict per year
 in this decade as horrific as it is even in the year scale  one can see a decline of violence since the end of the cold war there have been fewer civil wars  fewer genocides indeed a ninety percent reduction since  post world
  homicide and violent crime this is from the fbi uniform
 crime statistics you can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the ' 50s and the ' 60s then it
 soared upward for several decades and began a precipitous decline 
 starting in the 1990s so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in one thousand nine hundred and sixty president clinton if you 're here  
 so the question is  why are so many people so wrong about something so important  
 i think there are a number of reasons  one of them is we have better reporting  the associated press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the earth than sixteenth century monks were
  there 's a cognitive illusion  we
  that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something the higher the probability that you assign to it things that we read about in the paper with gory footage
 burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age
  there are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets
  no one ever attracted observers  advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better 
 laughter there 's guilt about our treatment of native peoples
 in modern intellectual life and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about western culture 
 and of course our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior one of the reasons violence
 went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time that 's a process that seems to be continuing  but if it outstrips behavior by the standards 
  of the day things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards so today we get exercised and rightly so if a
  appeal process we don 't consider that a couple of hundred years ago they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a
 trial that lasted ten minutes and indeed that that would have been repeated over and over again today we look at capital punishment as evidence
 of how low our behavior can sink rather than how high our standards have risen  well
 why has violence declined  no one really knows but
 i have read four explanations all of which i think have some grain of plausibility 
 the first is  maybe thomas hobbes got it right  he was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary poor  nasty brutish and short 
 not because he argued humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative but
  because of the logic of anarchy  in a state of anarchy there 's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively  before they invade you more recently thomas schelling 
  gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement being a good american he has a pistol in the nightstand pulls out his gun and walks down the stairs  and what does he see but a
  with a gun in his hand now  each one of them is thinking i don 't really want to kill that guy  but he 's about to kill me  maybe i had better shoot him
  before he shoots me  especially since even if he doesn 't want to kill me he 's probably worrying right now that i might kill him before he kills me and so on
 hunter gatherer peoples explicitly go through this
 train of thought and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first
  with this problem is by deterrence you don 't strike first but you have a
 publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded the only thing is that it 's liable to
 having its bluff called and therefore can only work if it 's credible 
 to make it credible you must avenge all insults and settle all scores which leads to the
  cycles of bloody vendetta life becomes an episode of the sopranos 
 hobbes ' solution the leviathan was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency
 a leviathan then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack because any kind of aggression will be punished leaving its profitability
  zero that would remove the temptation to invade preemptively out of fear of them attacking you first 
 it removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible  and therefore it would lead to a state of peace  
 eisner the man who plotted the homicide rates
 that you failed to see in the earlier slide argued that the timing of the decline of homicide
  in europe
 coincided with the rise of centralized states so that 's a bit of a support for the leviathan
 theory  also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy  in failed states  collapsed empires frontier regions  mafias  
 street gangs and so on 
 the second explanation is that in many times and places there
  is a widespread
 sentiment that life is cheap  in earlier times when
 suffering and early death were common in one 's own life one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on on others  and as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant  one puts a higher value on life in general 
  this was an argument from the political scientist james payne a third explanation invokes the concept of 
  game and was worked out in the book nonzero by the journalist robert wright 
 wright points out that in certain circumstances cooperation or non violence can benefit both parties in an interaction such as gains in trade when two two
 parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead or when two parties lay down their arms
  and split the so called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time 
 wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in by allowing the trade of goods services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people 
 the result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead and violence
  declines for selfish reasons as wright put it among the many reasons that i think that we should not bomb the japanese is that they built my mini van 
 the fourth explanation is
 captured in the title of a book called the expanding circle by the philosopher peter singer who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy
  ability to treat other peoples ' interests as comparable to one one 's own 
 unfortunately by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family people outside that circle are treated as sub human and can be exploited with impunity 
 but over history the circle has expanded  one can see
  in historical record it expanding from the village to the clan to the tribe to the nation to other races to both sexes and in singer 's own arguments something that we should extend to other sentient species
 the question is if this has happened what has powered that expansion and there are a number of possibilities such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that robert wright argues for
  logic of the golden rule the more you think about and interact with other people 
 the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your
 interests over theirs at least not if you want them to listen to you you can 't say that my interests are
 special compared to yours anymore than you can say that the particular spot that i 'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because i happen to be standing on it that very
 minute it may also be powered by
  cosmopolitanism by histories and journalism and memoirs and realistic fiction  and travel and literacy which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub human 
 and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life the sense that there but for fortune go
  of violence i think has profound implications it
 should force us to ask not just why is there war  but also  why is there peace 
 not just what are we doing wrong  but also what have we been doing right  
 because we have been doing something right  and it sure would be good to find out what it is  thank you very much
  people here in the room would say that that expansion of
 that you were talking about that peter singer talks about is also driven by just by technology by greater visibility of the other and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller
  wright 's theory that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles  but also i think it helps us
 imagine what it 's like to be someone else  i think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the middle ages you think how could they possibly have done it how could they have not have empathized with the person that they 're disemboweling but clearly
  as far as they 're concerned this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own anything i think that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person ca well
 steve i would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year i think it 's really important thank you so much
