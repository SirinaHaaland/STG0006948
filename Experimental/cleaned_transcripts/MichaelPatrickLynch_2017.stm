  imagine that you had your smartphone miniaturized and hooked up directly to your brain if
 you had this sort of brain chip you 'd be able to upload and download to the internet at the speed of thought
  accessing social media or wikipedia would be a lot like well from the inside at least like consulting your own memory it
 would be as easy and as intimate as thinking 
 but would it make it easier for you to know what 's true 
 just because a way of accessing information is faster it doesn 't mean it 's more reliable of course and it doesn 't mean that we would all interpret it the same way  
 and it doesn 't mean that you would be any better at evaluating it in fact you might even be worse because you know more
  data less time for evaluation 
 something like this is already happening to us right now  we already carry a world of information around in our pockets  
 but it seems as if the more information we share and access online 
 the more difficult it can be for us to tell the difference between what 's real
 and what 's fake it 's as if we know more but understand
 less
  now  it 's a feature of modern life i suppose that large swaths of the public live in isolated information bubbles  
 we 're polarized not just over values but over the facts
 one reason for that is the data analytics that drive the internet get us not just more information but more of the information that we want our online life is personalized  everything from the ads we read to
  the news that comes down our facebook feed
 is tailored to satisfy our preferences  
 and so while we get more information a lot of that information ends up reflecting ourselves as much as it does reality  
 it ends up  i suppose  inflating our bubbles rather than bursting them  
 and so maybe it 's no surprise that we 're in a situation a paradoxical
  situation of thinking that we know so much more and yet not agreeing on what it is we know 
 so how are we going to solve this problem of knowledge polarization  one obvious tactic is to
 try to fix our technology to redesign our digital platforms so as to make them less susceptible to polarization
  and i 'm happy to report that many smart people at google and facebook are working on just that and these projects are vital  
 i think that fixing technology is obviously really important  but i don 't think technology alone fixing it is going to solve the problem of knowledge polarization 
  i don 't think that because i don 't think at the end of the day it is a technological problem  
  in order to solve it i think we 're going to need help we 're going to need help from psychology and and political science but we 're also going to need help  i think  from philosophy  
 because to solve the problem of knowledge polarization  we 're going to need to reconnect
 with one fundamental
  that we live in a common reality  the idea of a common reality
 is like  i suppose a lot of philosophical concepts easy to state but mysteriously difficult to put into practice 
 to really accept it i think we need to do three things  each of which is a challenge right now  
 first
  we need to believe in truth you might have noticed that our culture is having something of a
 troubled relationship with that concept right now  it seems as if we disagree so much that as one political commentator put it not
 long ago  it 's as if there are no facts anymore  but that thought
 that thought is actually an expression of a sort of seductive line of argument that  that 's in the air  it goes like this
 we just can 't step outside of our own perspectives  we can 't step outside of our biases  every time we try  we just get more information from our perspective 
 so this line of thought goes  we might as well admit that objective truth is
 an illusion or it
  'll never know what it is or it doesn 't exist in the first place
 that 's not a new philosophical thought
 skepticism about truth
 during the end of the last century as some of you know it was very popular in certain academic circles  but
 it really goes back all the way to the greek philosopher protagoras if not farther back protagoras said that objective truth was an illusion because
  man is the measure of all things man is the measure of all things  
 that can seem like a bracing bit of realpolitik to people or liberating because it allows each of us to discover or or make our own truth  
 but actually i think it 's a bit of  self serving rationalization disguised
  it confuses the difficulty of being certain with the impossibility of truth  look
 of course it 's difficult to be certain about anything  
 we might all be living in the matrix you might have a brain chip in your head feeding you all the wrong information 
  we do agree on all sorts of facts  we agree
 that bullets can kill people  we agree that you can 't flap your arms and fly  we agree or we should
 that there is an external reality and ignoring it can get you hurt  
 nonetheless  skepticism about truth can be tempting
  because it allows us to rationalize away our own biases  when we do that we 're sort of like the guy in the movie
 who knew he was living in the matrix but decided he liked it there anyway  
 after all getting what you want feels good 
 being right all the time feels good  so often it 's easier for us to wrap ourselves
 in our cozy information bubbles live in bad faith and take those bubbles
  as the measure of reality an example i think of how this bad faith
 gets into our action is
 our reaction to the phenomenon of fake news  the fake news that spread on the internet
 during the american presidential election of two thousand and sixteen was designed to feed into our biases
  designed to inflate our bubbles  but what was really striking about it was not just that it fooled so many people 
 what was really striking to me about fake news  the phenomenon 
 is how quickly it itself became the subject of knowledge polarization  
 so much so that the very term the very term fake news now just means news story i don 't like
  that 's an example of the bad faith towards the truth that i 'm talking about 
 but the really  i think  dangerous thing
 about skepticism with regard to truth
 is that it leads to despotism man is the measure of all things inevitably becomes the man is the
  of all things just as every man for himself always seems to turn out to be only the strong survive at the end of orwell 's 
 the thought policeman o 'brien is torturing the protagonist winston smith into believing two plus two equals five 
  says is the point 
 is that he wants to convince smith that whatever the party says is the truth and the truth is whatever the party says 
 and what o 'brien knows is that once this thought is accepted  
 critical dissent
 is impossible you can 't speak truth to power if the power speaks truth by definition
 in order to accept that we really live in a common reality we have to do three things  the first thing is to believe in truth  the second thing can be summed up by the latin phrase that kant took as the motto for the enlightenment sapere
 or dare to know or as kant wants to dare to know for yourself 
 i think in the early days of the internet a lot of us thought that
 information
  technology was always going to make it easier for us to know for ourselves and of course in many ways  it has  but as the
 internet has become more and more a part of our lives our reliance on it our use of it has become often more passive 
 much of what we know today we google know 
 we download prepackaged
 prepackaged sets of facts
 and sort of shuffle them along the assembly line of social media 
 now google knowing is useful precisely because it involves a sort of intellectual outsourcing  we offload our effort onto a network of others and algorithms 
  and that allows us of course to not clutter our minds with all sorts of facts we can just download them when we need them and that 's awesome 
  but there 's a difference
 between downloading a set of facts
 and really understanding how or why those facts are as they are understanding why
 a particular disease spreads or how a mathematical proof works  or why your friend is depressed  involves more than just downloading 
 it 's going to require most likely doing some
 work for yourself
  having a little creative insight  
 using your imagination  getting out into the field doing the experiment working through the proof talking to someone 
 now  i 'm not saying of course that we should stop google knowing i 'm just saying we shouldn 't overvalue
  we need to find ways of encouraging forms of knowing that are more active and don 't always involve passing off our effort
 into our bubble because the thing about google knowing is that too often it ends up being bubble knowing 
 and bubble knowing means always being right 
 but daring to know  daring to understand 
 means risking the possibility that you could be wrong it
  means risking the possibility that what you want
 and what 's true are different things  which brings me to the third thing that i think we need to do
 if we want to accept that we live in a common reality that third thing is have a little humility by humility here i mean epistemic
  in a sense knowing that you don 't know it all  but it also means something more than that it means seeing your
 worldview as open to improvement by the evidence and experience of others  seeing your worldview as open to improvement by the evidence and experience of others  
 that 's more than just being open to change it 's more than just being open to self improvement it means
 seeing your knowledge as capable of enhancing or being enriched by what
 others contribute  that 's part of what is involved in recognizing there 's a common reality
 that you too are responsible to
 i don 't think it 's much of a stretch to say that our society is not particularly great at enhancing
 or encouraging that sort of humility 
  that 's partly because 
 well  we tend to confuse arrogance and confidence and it 's partly because well  you know  
 arrogance is just easier it 's just easier to think of yourself as knowing it all it 's just easier to think of yourself as as having it all figured out  
 but that 's another example of the bad faith towards the truth that i 've been talking about 
 so the concept of a common reality like a lot of philosophical concepts
  can seem so obvious that we can look right past it
 and forget why it 's important  democracies can 't function
 if their citizens don 't strive 
 at least some of the time to inhabit a common space a space where they can pass ideas back and forth
 when and especially when they disagree
 but you can 't strive to inhabit that space if you don 't already accept that you live in the same reality 
 to accept that we 've got to believe in truth we 've got to encourage more active ways of knowing 
 and we 've got to have the humility
 to realize that we 're not the measure of all things  
 we may yet
 one day realize the vision of having the internet in our brains  
 but if we want that to be liberating and not terrifying  if we want it to expand our understanding and not just our passive knowing  
 we need to remember that our perspectives
  as wondrous as beautiful as they are are just that perspectives on one reality  thank you
