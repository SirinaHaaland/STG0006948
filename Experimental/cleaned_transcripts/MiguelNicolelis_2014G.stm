  on june twelve two thousand and fourteen precisely at three 
 in a balmy winter afternoon in so paulo brazil a typical south american winter
  this kid this young man that you see celebrating here like he had scored a goal  juliano pinto twenty nine years old
 a magnificent deed despite being paralyzed and not having any sensation from 
 to the tip of his toes as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother
  in a wheelchair 
 juliano rose to the occasion and on this day did something that pretty much everybody that saw him in the six years deemed
 impossible 
 juliano pinto delivered the opening kick of the two thousand and fourteen
 brazilian world soccer cup here
 just by thinking  he could not move his body  but he could imagine
 the movements needed to kick a ball he was an athlete before the lesion 
  right now he 's going to be in the paralympic games i hope in a couple years 
 but what the spinal cord lesion did not rob from juliano was his ability to dream and dream he did
 that afternoon for a stadium of about seventy five thousand people and an audience of close to a billion
 watching on tv  and that kick crowned basically thirty years of basic research
 studying how the brain how this amazing universe that we have between our ears
 that is only comparable to universe that we have above our
  head because it has about one hundred billion elements talking to each other through electrical brainstorms what juliano accomplished
 took thirty years to imagine in laboratories and about fifteen years to plan 
 when john chapin and i fifteen years ago proposed in a paper that we would
  connecting a brain to devices so that
 animals and humans could just move these devices no matter how far they are from their own bodies just by imagining what they want to do 
 our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help 
 of the psychiatry variety  and despite that a scot
  because that 's how we were
 raised in our respective countries 
 and for twelve fifteen years 
 we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible and a brain machine interface is not rocket science it 's just brain research it
 's nothing but
 using sensors to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord so we
  projected sensors that can read hundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously  and extract from these electrical signals
 the motor planning that the brain is generating to actually make us move into space  
 and by doing that we converted these signals into digital commands that any
 mechanical electronic or even a virtual device can understand so that the subject can imagine
 what he she or it wants to make move and the device obeys that brain command 
 by sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors as you are going to see in a moment we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary 
  motor will was being enacted no matter where next to the subject next door
  the planet  
 and as this message gave feedback back to the brain the brain realized its goal to make us move  
 so this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago  where a monkey without moving its body  learned to control the movements of an avatar arm a virtual arm that doesn
  what you 're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey
 as it explores three different visually identical spheres in virtual space  
 and to get a reward a drop of orange juice that monkeys love this animal has to detect select one of these objects by touching 
 not by seeing it by touching it because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects an
  electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal describing the fine texture of the surface of this object so the animal can judge what is the correct object that he has to grab  and if he does that he gets a reward
 without moving a muscle the perfect brazilian lunch not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice  
 so as we saw this happening  we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published fifteen years
  ago we reenacted this paper we got it out of the drawers 
 and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed to actually use the brain machine interface to regain mobility  
 the idea was that if you suffered and that can happen to any one of us  let me tell you it 's very sudden it 's a millisecond of
  a car accident that transforms your life completely 
 if you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord you cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles  however your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head  
 paraplegic quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night  
 they have that inside their head the problem is how to get that code out of it and make the movement be created again  so what we proposed was let 's create a new body
 's create a robotic vest and that 's exactly why juliano could kick that ball just by thinking  because he was wearing the first brain controlled robotic vest 
 that can be used by paraplegic quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback 
  all over the five continents of this beautiful earth  
 dropped their lives  dropped their patents dropped their dogs wives  kids  school  jobs  
 and congregated to come to brazil for eighteen months to actually get this done  because a couple years after brazil was awarded the world cup we heard
 that the brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country
 that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the germans of course but
 that 's a different talk  and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that 
 but what brazil wanted to do is to showcase a completely different country  a country that values science and technology and can give a gift
  million people around the world that cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury well we went to the brazilian government and to fifa
 and proposed well let 's have the kickoff of the two thousand and fourteen world cup be given by a brazilian paraplegic using a brain controlled exoskeleton that allows 
  him to kick the ball and to feel the contact of the ball they looked at us thought that we were completely nuts  and said
  we had eighteen months to do everything from zero from scratch we had no exoskeleton we had no patients  we had nothing done these people came all together 
 and in eighteen months we got eight patients in a routine of training
  exoskeleton to be built was named after the most famous brazilian scientist ever  alberto santos dumont who on october nineteen 
  one created and flew himself the first controlled airship
 on air in paris for a million people to see sorry my american
  i live in north carolina  but it was two years before the wright brothers flew on the coast of north carolina applause
 flight control is brazilian 
 so we went together with these guys and we basically put this exoskeleton together fifteen degrees of freedom
  hydraulic machine that can be commanded by brain signals recorded by a  non invasive technology called electroencephalography
 that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements and send his commands to
 the controls the motors and get it done 
 this exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin invented by gordon cheng one of my greatest friends in munich to
  to allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground to be delivered back to the patient through a vest  a shirt it is a smart shirt 
 with  micro vibrating elements that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient 's brain by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him but it is he who is walking again  
 and he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything and you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet because bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs 
  to be performed  the computer is going to analyze it bruno is going to certify it and when it is certified the device starts moving under the command of bruno 's brain  
  without being able to move he is walking by himself and more than that more than
 just walking  
 he is feeling the ground  
 and if the speed of the exo goes up he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of santos the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident that 's why the
  is creating a new sensation in bruno 's head  
 so he walks and at the end of the walk i am running out of time already he says you know guys 
 i need to borrow this thing from you when i get married because i wanted to walk to the priest
 and see my bride and actually be there by myself of course he will have it whenever he wants 
 and this is what we wanted to show during the world cup
 because for some mysterious reason fifa cut its broadcast in half what you are going to see very quickly is juliano pinto
 in the exo
 doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd and
 the lights you are going to see just describe the operation basically the blue lights pulsating
  indicate that the exo is ready to go it can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback and when juliano makes the decision to kick the ball you are going to see two streams of green 
  and yellow light coming from the helmet and going to the legs  representing the mental commands that were taken
  commands he gets ready the ball is set  and he kicks  
 and the most amazing thing is ten seconds after he did that and looked at us on the pitch he told us celebrating as you saw i felt the ball 
 and that 's priceless so
 where
  going to go i have two minutes to tell you that it 's going to the limits of your imagination
 brain actuating technology is here this is the latest we just published this a year ago the first  brain to brain interface that allows two animals to exchange mental messages so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment
 can send a mental
 sms  a torpedo  a
  to the second animal and the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message because the message came from the first animal 's brain  
 so this is the first demo i 'm going to be very quick because i want to show you the latest  
 but what you see here
 is the first rat
 getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to
  press the left cage to basically get a reward  he goes there and does it and the same time he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn 't see any light 
 and the second rat in seventy percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward
 without ever experiencing the light in the retina 
  a little higher limit
 by getting monkeys to collaborate mentally in a brain net 
 basically to donate their brain activity and combine them to move the virtual arm that i showed you before and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine 
  their brains synchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move one monkey is controlling the x dimension  the other monkey is controlling the y dimension
  but it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there
 and you ask one monkey to control x and y  the other monkey to control y and z  and the third one to control x and z  and you make them 
  all play the game together moving the arm in 3d into a target to get the famous brazilian orange juice  
 is the average of all these brains working in parallel in real time 
 that is the definition of a biological computer interacting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal 
 where is this going we have no idea
 to the edge and discover what is out there but one thing i know one day in a few decades when our grandchildren surf the net just by thinking  
  or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see or somebody speaks because of a brain to brain bypass 
  couple more minutes because there are a couple of points we want to develop and of course  clearly it seems that we need connected brains to figure out where this is going  so let 's connect all this together  
 so if i 'm understanding correctly one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other
  monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting
 the neurological impulse miguel nicolelis no it 's a little different  no monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys they are getting a visual feedback in 2d 
 but the task they have to accomplish is 3d they have to move an arm in three dimensions  but each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls
 to get that thing done you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains but the ideal is three  
 so what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down  the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back  so this adjusts dynamically  but 
  the global synchrony
  remains the same 
 now if you flip without telling the monkey the dimensions that each brain has to control like this guy is controlling x and y  but he should be controlling now y and z  instantaneously 
 that animal 's brain forgets about the old dimensions and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions  
  so we will absorb technology as part of us  technology will never absorb us it 's simply impossible 
 bg how many times have you tested this 
 and how many times have you succeeded versus failed mn oh 
  tens of times with the three monkeys oh several times i wouldn 't be able to talk about this here unless i had done it a few times and i forgot to mention because of
  was one bit of information big ideas start in a humble way but basically
 the brain activity of one subject was transmitted to a second object all
  so the first subject got a message like our rats a visual message  and transmitted it to the second subject 
 the second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex  
 or a different
 pulse two different pulses 
 in one pulse the subject saw something on the other pulse he saw something different and he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending
 through the internet across continents
