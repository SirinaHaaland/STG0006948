  my favorite topic is
 shortcuts  the master of shortcuts it 's of course  nature  but i will demonstrate different ways
  difficulties and go to the point to find an answer probably much quicker than arthur did  so  first
 we violate the common sense  the logic all of you if you hold your hand like this  ninety degrees
 all of you  not you  all of you  right  palm
  if you do this the common  the logic says you must turn the wrist do you agree  
 good  but i will first teach you
 a method how you can do it without moving the wrist  and then the shortcut  you can do it immediately  right  
 hold the hand like this palm up don 't move the wrist the wrist is i doesn 't speak very many but i do the best what i are
  right molded you say with iron that was a joke actually  and i
 ok  
 hold the hand palm up do this  don 't move the wrist  over the heart  don 't move the wrist  forward don 't move the wrist 
 up  don 't move the wrist  over the heart
  you have got to this position from this without moving the wrist now the shortcut 
 but it was six six moves  now with one move  i start here  palm down you can
  that was the warming up
 now i need an assistant i talked to a nice
  and you can sit over there one item here was water  right  and i will give my tribute
 to water i think it 's enough with water for me the other guys can talk about
  i will demonstrate different ways of memorizing control cards and so on and
  don 't gamble but so if we are
 if we have
  now i will interact so a different person
 all the time so not the same person can answer so we have an agreement  
 which one shall have a good poker hand which number one two three four or five lennart green three good  and
 here  i had a mat here to make it a little the critical moment is
 if a card shark gathers the cards together immediately when he
 before he deals the card now  
 so i think number three i have arranged them in a full house 
 with queens and it
  i start with three queens  
 so here you see the contrast when i treat the cards 
 and two tens 
  also the other hand is good if all the other guys have good hands too so these guys have actually a stronger hand three aces and two kings 
 this guy beats them with four of a kind or deuce deuce
  i will have the winning hand ten jack queen
  hand that looks so good from the beginning number three  at the end was actually the lowest hand such life  right  
 so please
 mix them  now  if you are interested i will demonstrate some underground techniques 
  the first term is estimation here i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush of course
  count the cards but this is much quicker right you agree  so here i have actually 
 i know exactly where the cards are so here i can make a bet  and this is actually one of the points where i get my money  so here
  a term
 i do it quick  i call this stealing  
 so here  i think i know about where the cards are i will spread the cards and you 'll say stop when i point to them right
 ok  
 now  another term called shuffle tracking 
 shuffle tracking means i keep track of the cards  
 even if another person person shuffles  this is a little risky so because if you look now i can still see
  agree  but if you square square  and shuffle 
 and then a cut so here  to follow my cards i must look at the shuffle from the
  to calculate but actually i don 't like to calculate  i work direct with the right brain  if you pass the left brain you have to take care of logic and common sense 
 direct in the right brain that 's much better and so 
 arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing and
  if you work with in the right atmosphere with humor  you have that 's the password to the
 cosmic bank of knowledge where you can find any solution of
 any problem  ok  now i drop the cards and you say stop anyway right  not at the last card zoe stop lg 
 yeah  when i 'm sober i do this much quicker  but we will check
  not in order it that was a mistake no i 'm kidding 
 no  now and then i put in a mistake just to emphasize how difficult it is right 
 yeah last night i forgot that that was a mistake but now i 'm glad i remember it so
  this deck is bought here sorry i have a little pad to make it a little softer 
 this deck is bought here in america it 's called 
 bicycle and this deck is very flexible but not so many people know  
  at the right spots you see how thin and flexible this deck is right  now you can carry this in your wallet so
  when we will have it back you do this  but not too much  then you
 have to push it down again here please if you push these
 heaps everyone see push them together so they are really interlaced
 and then i will demonstrate a thing from
 russian satellite stealen stolen 
 probably copied from america but we will see 
 here
 shortcuts  i talk about shortcuts
  i go very quick
 through the deck and try to find some pattern  
 the new chaos theory is already old right  but you know i think you are familiar with
 fractals the mandelbrot spirals and all these things  and
 it 's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern
  and not concentrate if you concentrate and calculate then you go to
 then it 's the left brain but if you just look and talk in another language  
 yeah great i think i have it  so now different persons
  all the time when i lift the heap i peek
  seven of diamonds perfect my favorite yeah seven so i will do it quick  very quick  but in slow motion so you can follow
  i think i do it the same way  i like to
 so i know where it is  ten of diamonds  but now i do it the regular speed right
  person even if it 's the same spot we can take some over there later  so now i will drop the cards 
 and you 'll say stop  anywhere got it five of clubs  
 not the last yes that 's difficult to find a card here we do it
 again the person who said five of clubs say stop  when the cards are in the
  use a little force there  i think we save five of clubs  and now a card with a contrast of five of clubs
  i will do the most difficult thing 
 for example you are sitting in las vegas  and you 're betting  and you let the other guys peek this card
 by mistake  feel it 's just the regular one card  and now when i lift this card  it shall
  queen of hearts  so that 's a tough challenge right  
 so here i grab
 you know this five of clubs  and queen of hearts  yes this is a tough
 one because here i must take
  switch it with the five of clubs  so now a false count which card shall i use queen or five
  time eight nine  ten  this is a kind of optical deal right  
 when i put one card at a table look it 's not one card it 's look it 's a bunch of cards that gives this
 impression  yeah  
 now some hard stuff
  i think we keep the queen here  yes  
 now to the satellites things  
 this oh sorry  don 't look at the beam my fault
  now  when i deal the cards in the laser 
 i know where they are but yes  did the camera got it
  do the cameras see the cards now
  back the other one take back the queen
  i have to peek lots of cards  i think there are lots of
 i don 't know how many but ten fifteen spades in a deck at least right laughter
 so every time i lift the heap i peek right  then i arrange them so i can
 get them quick
  so i start with the ace
 yeah ace ah yeah spades same mistake as before right  so
 i arrange the spades the clubs
  i try to do this right here first i take the spades  you see i don 't work with prestige so always do mistakes 
 it doesn 't matter to me  and now
  and then i get some extra sympathy points
  and we switch this to the king  ace of diamonds  and now look ace of diamonds will guide  
 so i find 
  there was the place  and here is king of spades  correct yeah ok 
 now a little more difficult thing maybe you think i have the cards in order already so you help me to shuffle again  another suit please
  like this guy yeah  
 ok  that should be my end effect but ok  armani who said armani 
 you  i drop the cards and you which size  
 which size it 's a piece of cake i like challenges  which size
  this is tough 
 ok  a suit  i had
  to locate diamonds i look at the cards and ok we try  yeah  you help me  if i drop the card face up 
 like this you reverse it
  i work with pattern
  why do i put myself in this position 
 i have to figure out so many outs when i miss some cards but i love it  so now i will do it  i will try to
  find
 find the diamonds  but i will do it the hard way  it 's too easy to do it right away right  
 i think i will do it  
 blindfolded 
 at this distance it works immediately
  i like the empathy empathy  but it was
  you can take the nostril too because some guys think
  with dignity and elegance right  
 but i like her yeah i said be a little
  rely on other senses right 
 i work with vibration
  start with ace of diamonds  just kidding warming up king of hearts 
 laughter and i give you a diamonds  so they so you put them here in a nice row right  and you can see
  i never ever miss two  this is interesting always i 've found two  but the wrong color spades sorry
  and the deck is a gift to you after so let the skepticals here in this  examine them  right  remind me it 's a gift
 two and it was two of
  two of diamonds  i 'll do it quick now three three of diamonds
  this is maybe a little tough we will try
  you see that in the screen and this is face up  and it 's not at the bottom here so next card will be was it five
  i do this  i know where it is because i peeked before and then
  i love this jonny wayne move
