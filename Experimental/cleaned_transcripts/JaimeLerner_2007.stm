  understand my english in the mornings it is terrible and the afternoon is worst 
 during many
  i made some speeches starting with this
 saying city is not a problem it 's a solution and
 more and more i 'm convinced
 that it 's not only a solution for a country  but it 's a solution
 for the problem of climate change  but
 we have a very pessimistic approach about
  the cities  i 'm working in cities for almost forty years  and
 where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big
 the other mayors say we don 't have financial resources i would like to say
 from the experience i had
  the world can be improved in less than three years
   there 's no matter of scale  it 's not a question of scale it 's not a question of financial resources  
 every problem in a city
 has to have its own equation of
  so
 to start  i want to introduce some characters
 from a book i made for teenagers  the best example of quality of life is the turtle
 because the turtle is an example of living and working together  
 and when you realize that
 the casque of the turtle
 looks like an urban tessitura  and
 can we imagine if we cut the casque of the turtle how sad she 's going to be and
 that 's what we 're doing in our cities living here working here  having leisure here  
 and most of the people are leaving the city
  living outside of the city  so  the other
 character is otto  the automobile  he is invited for a party
 he never wants to leave  the chairs are on the tables and still drinking and he drinks a lot
  he asks always
 for more infrastructure  
 freeways he 's a very demanding person and on the other hand  accordion the friendly bus he
  speaking about the design every city has its own design  
 curitiba  my city  three million in the metropolitan area one million eight hundred
 thousand people
  's like two birds kissing themselves 
 oaxaca san francisco it 's very easy  
 market street van ness and the waterfront  
 and every city has its own design  
 but to make it happen sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design an idea that everyone or the large majority will help you to make it happen  
 and that 's the
  of the city of curitiba and it 's an example of living and working together  and this is
 where we have more density it 's where we have more public transport so this system started in 
 we started with twenty five thousand passengers a day now it 's two
  hundred thousand passengers a day  
 and it took twenty five years until another city  which is bogota  and they did a very good job  
 and now there 's eighty three cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the brt of curitiba and
  it 's important
 not for only your own city  every city  besides its normal problems they have
 a very important role in being with the whole humanity 
 that means mostly two main issues mobility and sustainability are becoming very important for the cities 
 and this is an articulated bus
 and we are very close to my house you can come when you are in curitiba and have a coffee there  
 and that 's the evolution of the system  
 what in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes the boarding tube gives to the bus
  this is the design of the bus and
 you can pay before entering the bus you 're boarding 
 and for handicapped they can use this as a normal
  what i 'm trying to say is
 the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars more than fifty percent
 so
 when we depend only on cars
  's not enough new sources of energy  it 's the concept of the city  the design of the city that 's
 also important too and also how to teach the children
 i
 'll speak on this later on our idea of mobility is
  trying
 to make the connections between all the systems we started in ' eighty three proposing for the city of rio how to connect the subway with the bus 
 the subway was against of course and twenty three years after 
 they called us to develop we 're developing this idea and you can understand how different it 's going to be
  the image of rio with the system
 frequency  and it 's not shanghai it 's not being colored during the day only at night
 it will look this way  and
 before you say it 's a norman foster design
  and this is the model how it 's going to work so it 's the same system  the vehicle is different  
 and that 's the model  
 what i 'm trying to say is i 'm not trying to prove which
 system of transport is better i 'm trying to say we have to combine
 to combine all the systems  and with one condition  never
 if you have a subway  if you have surface systems  if you have any kind of system
 never compete in the same space
  coming back to the car i always used to say that the car is like your 
 you have to have good relationship with her  but she cannot command your life 
 so when the only woman
  the ideas about how to transform through design
 old quarries and open universities
 and botanic garden all of it 's related to
 how we teach the children
  teach the children  and the children we teach during six months how to separate their garbage 
 and after the children teach their parents  and now we have seventy percent
 since twenty years it 's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world 
  teach the children  i would like to say if we want to have a sustainable world
 we have to work with
 everything what 's said  but don 't forget the cities and the children  i 'm working in a
  because you cannot have empty places during eighteen hours a day  you should have
 always a structure of living and working together  
 try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the twenty four hours  
 another issue
  a city 's like our family portrait  we don 't rip our family portrait  even if we don 't like the nose of our uncle
  because this portrait is you 
 and these are the references
 that we
 have in any city  this is the main pedestrian mall we did it in seventy two hours  yes you have to be fast
  references from
 our ethnic contribution this is the italian portal the
 ukrainian park  the polish park  the japanese square  the german park all of a sudden the soviet union 
 they split  and since we have people from uzbekistan
  we have to stop the program 
 don 't forget creativity starts when you cut a zero
 from your budget if you cut two zeros it 's much better  and
 this is the wire opera theater we did it in two months
  old quarries that they were transformed into parks
 quarries once made the nature  and sometimes we took this and we transformed  
 and
 every part
 can be transformed every frog can be transformed in a
  in a city 
 you have to work fast  planning takes time  and i 'm proposing urban acupuncture that means
 me with some focal ideas
 to help the normal process of planning  and this is an acupuncture
 note
 or
  the smallest park in new york  the most beautiful thirty two meters  so  i want just to end
 saying that
 you can always propose new materials
 new sustainable materials but keep in mind
 that we have to work fast
 to the end  because
 we don 't have the whole time to plan and i think
 creativity innovation is starting 
 and we cannot have all the answers so when you start and we
  we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers it 's important starting and
 having the contribution from from people and they
 could teach you if you 're not in the right track at the end  i would like if you can help me to sing
  you 're going to make the music and the rhythm
  separate their garbage
