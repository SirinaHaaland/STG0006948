  two hundred years
 of modern science 
 we have to admit that our performance is not great the machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures  
  the houses we build
 do not survive severe earthquakes but we shouldn 't be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason they didn 't have much time 
 two hundred years is not a lot of time  while nature
 had three billion years
 to perfect some of the most amazing materials that we wish we had in our possession  
 remember these materials carry a quality assurance
 of three billion years
 take for example sequoia trees  they carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years
 in cold weather  in warm climates uv light  
 yet  if you look at the structure by high resolution electron microscopy  and you ask yourself what is it made of surprisingly
  made of sugar  
 well not exactly as we drink in our tea it 's actually a nanofiber called nanocrystalline cellulose  and this nanocrystalline cellulose
 is so strong on a weight basis  it 's about ten times stronger than steel  yet it 's made of sugar  
 so scientists all over the world believe that 
 is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry  but here 's the
  problem say you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose to build a boat or an airplane  well  you can google you can ebay you can even alibaba 
 you won 't find it of course you 're going to find
 thousands of scientific papers great papers where scientists are going to say this is a great
  lots of things we can do with it but no commercial source  
 so we at the hebrew university  together with our partners in sweden decided to focus on the development
 process to produce this 
  of course  we didn 't want to cut trees  so we were looking for another source of raw material  and we found one
 in fact  the sludge of the paper industry
 the reason  there is a lot of it europe alone produces eleven million tons of that material annually it
 's the equivalent
 of a mountain three kilometers high  sitting on a soccer field 
 and we produce this mountain every year  so for everybody  it 's an environmental problem  and for us it 's a gold mine
 so now we are actually producing on an industrial scale in israel  nanocellulose and very soon in sweden 
 we can do a lot of things with the material for example  
 we have shown that by adding only a small percent of 
 into cotton fibers the same as my shirt is made of it increases its strength dramatically so this can be used for
  making
 amazing things like  super fabrics for industrial and medical applications  but this is not the only thing 
 for example
  structures like the shelters that you can see now actually are now showcasing in the venice biennale
  nature actually didn 't stop its wonders
 in the plant kingdom  
 think about insects cat fleas for example have the ability to jump about a hundred times their height 
 that 's amazing  it 's the equivalent of a person standing in the middle of liberty island
 in new york
  and in a single jump going to the top
 of the statue of liberty 
 i 'm sure everybody would like to do that 
 so the question is how do cat fleas do it it turns out they make this wonderful material  which is called resilin 
 in simple words resilin which is a protein 
 is the most
 elastic
  you can squish it and it doesn 't lose almost any energy to the environment
 when you release it snap it brings back all the energy  
 so i 'm sure everybody would like to have that material  but here 's the problem 
 to catch cat fleas is difficult
  it 's actually enough to catch one now we can extract its dna and read how cat fleas make the resilin and clone it
 into a less jumpy organism
 like a plant  
 so that 's exactly what we did  now we have the ability to produce lots of resilin well  my team decided to do something really cool at the university
  decided to combine the strongest material produced by the plant kingdom with the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom
 nanocellulose with resilin and the result is amazing 
 this material  in fact is tough elastic and transparent  
 so there are lots of things that can be done with this material for example
  shoes  so we can jump higher  run faster and even touch screens for computers
 and smartphones that won 't break  well  the problem is we continue
 to implant synthetic implants in our body  which we glue and screw
 into our body  and i 'm going to say that this is not a good idea  why  because they fail this synthetic
  fails just like this
 plastic fork 
 that is not strong enough for its performance 
 but sometimes they are too strong  and therefore their mechanical properties do not really fit their surrounding tissues  
 but in fact the reason is much more fundamental  the reason is
 that in nature there is no one there
 that actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck
 or takes my skin and glues it onto my body  
 in nature everything is self assembled 
 so every living cell  whether coming from a plant insect or human being has a dna
 that encodes for  nanobio building blocks many times they are proteins other times they are enzymes that make other materials like polysaccharides
  fatty acids and the common feature about all these materials
 is that they need no one they recognize each other and  self assemble into structures
 scaffolds on which cells are proliferating
 to give tissues  they develop into organs and together bring
  so we at the hebrew university about ten years ago decided to focus on probably the most important biomaterial
 for humans which is collagen  
 why collagen  because collagen accounts for about twenty five percent of our dry weight we have nothing more than collagen  other than water 
 in our body  
 so i always like to say anyone who is in the replacement parts of human beings
  like to have collagen 
 admittedly before we started our project there were already more than one thousand medical implants made of collagen you
 know simple things like dermal fillers
 to reduce wrinkles  augment lips and other more sophisticated medical implants like heart valves  so where is the problem well
 the problem is the source the source of
  all that collagen is actually coming from dead bodies  dead pigs  dead cows
 and even human cadavers  so safety is a big issue  
 but it 's not the only one also the quality now here i have a personal interest this is my
  in our winery in israel a heart valve very similar to the one that i showed you before seven years ago was implanted in his body  
 now the scientific literature says that these heart valves
 start to fail
 ten years after the operation 
 no wonder they are made from old used tissues  just like this
 wall made of bricks that is falling apart yeah
 of course i can take those bricks and and build a new wall  but it 's not going to be the same  so the us food and drug administration
 made a notice already in two thousand and seven asking the companies to start to look for better alternatives  
 so that 's exactly what we did  
 we decided to clone
 all the five human genes responsible for making
 type i collagen in humans
 into a transgenic
 tobacco plant  so now the plant has the ability to make human collagen
 brand new untouched  this is amazing actually it 's happening now  today in israel we
  thousand square meters of greenhouses all over the country  
 the farmers receive small plantlets of tobacco it looks exactly like regular tobacco  except that they have five human genes they 're
 responsible for making type i collagen  
 we grow them for about fifty to seventy days  
 we harvest the leaves and then the leaves are transported by cooling trucks to the factory there the process of extracting the collagen starts
 now  if you ever made a pesto essentially the same thing 
 you crush the leaves  you get the juice that contains the collagen we
 concentrate the protein transfer the protein to clean rooms for the final purification and the end result
 is a collagen identical to what we have in our body
 untouched brand new and from which we
  make different medical implants bone void fillers for example  for severe
 bone fractures  spinal fusion and more recently even we 've been able to launch into the market
 here in europe a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers
  that is now approved for use in the clinic  this is not science fiction this is happening now we are using plants
 to make medical implants for replacement parts for human beings 
 in fact more recently we 've been able to make collagen fibers which are six times stronger than the achilles tendon 
 that 's amazing
 together with our partners from ireland  we thought about the next thing
 to those fibers by doing that we 've been able to make a superfiber which is about three hundred and eighty percent
 tougher and three hundred percent more elastic 
 so oddly enough in the future  when a patient is transplanted with
 artificial tendons
  have better performance after the surgery than we had before the injury
  so what 's for the future  in the future we believe we 'll be able to make
 many nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us
 collagen
 and many more and that will enable us to make better machines perform better
  heart is not going to be the same as we can get from a donor  it will be better it actually will perform better
 and will last longer my friend zion suliman once told me a smart
 sentence  he said if you want a new idea  you should open an old book and i 'm going to say
 that the book was written it was written over three billion years
  of evolution and the text is the dna of life all we have to do
 is read this text embrace nature 's gift to us and start our progress from here thank you
