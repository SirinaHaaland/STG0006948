  i have a confession to make i am addicted to adventure and as a young boy 
 i would rather look outside the window at the birds in
  where time stands still and even sometimes dies 
 my teachers thought there was something wrong with me because i wasn 't paying attention in class 
 they didn 't find anything specifically wrong with me other than being slightly dyslexic because i 'm a lefty  
 but they didn 't test
  to me is about our connection with the world with the universe it
 's about seeing what 's around that next coral head or what 's around that next tree  and learning more not only about our environment but about ourselves  
 now  my dream of dreams i want to go explore the oceans of mars  but until we can go there
  i think the oceans still hold
 quite a few secrets as a matter of fact  if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is
 and dissect it into a living space the ocean represents over three point four billion cubic kilometers of volume within which we 've explored less than five percent  
  even scuba diving  
 but if we 're going to explore the final frontier on this planet  we need to live there  
 we need to build a log cabin if you will at the bottom of the sea 
 and so there was a great curiosity in my soul when i went to go visit a ted [ prize winner ] by the name of dr sylvia earle maybe
  you 've heard of her  two years ago  she was staked out at the last undersea marine laboratory
 to try and save it to try and petition for us not to scrap it
 and bring it back on land  
 we 've only had about a dozen or so scientific labs at the bottom of the sea there 's only one left in the world it 's nine miles offshore and
 's called aquarius  
 aquarius in some fashion is a dinosaur 
 an ancient robot chained to the bottom this leviathan 
 in other ways it 's a legacy  
 and so with that visit i realized that my time is short if i wanted to experience what it was like to become an aquanaut
  swam towards this after many moons of torture and two years of preparation this
 habitat
 waiting to invite us was like a new home 
 and the point of going down to and living at this habitat was not to stay inside  it wasn 't about
  at something the size of a school bus it was about giving us the luxury of time outside to wander to explore to understand more about this oceanic final frontier 
 we had megafauna come and visit us this spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans 
 but why this is so important  why this picture is up is because this particular animal brought his friends around 
  and instead of being the pelagic animals that they were they started getting curious about us these new
 strangers that were moving into the neighborhood  
 doing things with plankton
  we were studying all sorts of animals and critters and they got closer and closer to us  and because of the luxury of time these animals these residents of the coral reef were starting to get used to us and these pelagics that normal travel through stopped
  full days during our mission 
 so mission thirty one wasn 't so much about breaking records  it was about that human ocean connection 
 because of the luxury of time we were able to study animals such as sharks and grouper in aggregations that we 've never seen before it 's like seeing
 dogs and cats behaving well together even being able to commune with animals that are much larger than us such as this endangered goliath grouper
 who only still resides in the florida keys of course just like any neighbor  after a while if they get tired 
 the goliath grouper barks at us and this bark is so powerful that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all within a split second
  for us it 's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone  
 now 
 this wasn 't just about adventure there was actually a serious note to it we did a lot of science  and again because of the luxury of time we were able to do over three years of science in thirty one days 
 in this particular case we were using a pam or let me just see if i can get this straight a pulse
  and from northeastern
 were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do when we 're not around 
 the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer or pam  gauges the fluorescence of corals
 as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change related issues  we used all
 sorts of other cutting edge tools such as this sonde or what i like to call the the sponge 
 whereby the sonde itself tests for metabolism rates in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge  or the redwoods of the [ ocean ] 
 and this gives us a much better gauge of what 's happening underwater with regard to climate
  and how the dynamics of that affect us here on land  
 and finally we looked at predator prey behavior and predator prey behavior is an interesting thing because as we take away some of the predators on these coral reefs around the world 
 the prey or the forage fish act very differently
 what we realized is not only do they stop taking care of the reef  
 darting in grabbing a little bit of algae and going back into their homes they start spreading out and disappearing from those particular coral reefs
 well within that thirty one days we were able to generate over ten scientific papers on each one of these topics 
 but the point of adventure is not only to
 learn it 's to be able to share that knowledge with the world  and with that thanks to a couple of engineers at mit we were able to
  up to twenty thousand frames per second in a little box that 's worth three thousand dollars  it 's available to every one of us  
 and that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we can 't even see it in the blink of an eye let me show you a quick video
 of what this camera
  can see the silky bubble
 come out of our hard hats 
 it gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for thirty one days and never normally would have paid attention to 
 such as hermit crabs now  using a cutting edge piece of technology that 's not really meant for the oceans is not always easy  
 we sometimes had to put the camera upside down  cordon it back to the lab and
 actually man the trigger from the lab itself but what this gives us
 is the foresight to look at and analyze in scientific and engineering terms
 some of the most amazing behavior that the human eye just can 't pick up such as this manta shrimp
  that punch is as strong as a 22 caliber bullet and if you ever try to catch a bullet in  mid flight with your eye  
 impossible but now we can see things such as these christmas tree worms pulling in
 and fanning out in a way that the eye just can 't capture or in this case a fish throwing up grains of sand
 this is an actual sailfin goby  and if you look at it in real time it actually doesn 't even show its fanning motion because it 's so quick 
 one of the most precious gifts that we had underwater is that we had wifi 
  days straight we were able to connect with the world in real time from the bottom of the sea and share all of these experiences quite literally right there i am skyping in the classroom with one of the six 
  continents and some of the seventy thousand students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences as a matter of fact i 'm showing a picture that i took with my smartphone from underwater
  dream of the day that we have underwater cities  and maybe just maybe if we push the boundaries of adventure
 and knowledge  and we share that knowledge with others out there we can solve all sorts of problems 
 my grandfather used to say people protect what they love 
 my father how can people protect what they don 't understand
 and i 've thought about this my whole life 
 nothing is impossible  
 we need to dream  we need to be creative  and we all need to have an adventure
 in order to create miracles in the darkest of times  and whether it 's about climate change
 or eradicating poverty
 or giving back to future generations
  what we 've taken for granted  
 it 's about adventure and who knows maybe there will be underwater cities  and maybe some of you will become the future aquanauts  thank you very much
