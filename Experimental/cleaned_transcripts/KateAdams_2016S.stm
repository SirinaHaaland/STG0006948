  tina lord found herself in quite the pickle see this gold digger made sure she married sweet cord roberts just before he inherited millions 
 but when cord found out tina loved his money as much as she loved him he dumped her 
 cord 's mother maria was thrilled until
  they hooked up again  so maria hired max holden to romance tina and then made sure cord didn 't find out tina was pregnant with his baby  
 so tina 
 still married but thinking cord didn 't love her flew to argentina with max cord finally figured out what was going on and rushed after them but he was too late 
 tina had already been kidnapped strapped to a
  raft and sent over a waterfall she and her baby were presumed dead cord was sad
 for a bit but then he bounced right back with a
 supersmart archaeologist named kate and they had a gorgeous wedding until tina  seemingly back from the dead ran into the church holding a baby
 ladies and gentlemen is how the soap opera one life to live introduced a love story that lasted
 now if you 've ever seen a soap opera you know the stories and the characters can be exaggerated larger than life and if you 're a fan you find that exaggeration fun and if you 're not  
 find them melodramatic or unsophisticated maybe you think watching soap operas is a waste of time that their bigness means their lessons are small or nonexistent  
 but i believe the opposite to be true 
 soap operas reflect life just bigger  
 so there are real life lessons we can learn from soap operas and those lessons are as big and adventurous as any
 soap opera storyline 
 now i 've been a fan since i ran home from the bus stop in second grade desperate to catch the end of luke and laura 's wedding the biggest moment in general hospital history so you
 can imagine how much i loved my eight years as the assistant casting director on as the world turns my job was watching soap operas  reading soap opera scripts and auditioning actors to be on
  and yes soap operas are
 larger than life drama on a grand scale but our lives can be filled with as much intensity and the stakes can feel just as dramatic 
 we cycle through tragedy and joy just like these characters we cross thresholds fight demons and find
 find salvation unexpectedly and we do it again and again and again but just like soaps  we can flip the script  which means we can learn from these characters that move 
  like bumblebees  looping and swerving through life and we can use those lessons to craft our own life stories 
  and most importantly they show us it 's never too late to change your story  
 so with that let 's start with soap opera lesson one surrender is not an option 
 all my children ' s erica kane was daytime 's version of scarlett o 'hara a hyperbolically self important princess who deep down was scrappy and daring
  on tv perhaps erica 's most famous scene is her alone in the woods suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear she screamed at the bear 
 you may not do this do you understand me  you may not come near me  
 i am erica kane and you are a filthy beast 
 and of course the bear left  so what that teaches us is
  obstacles are to be expected and we can choose to surrender
 or we can stand and fight  
 pandora 's tim westergren knows this better than most you might even call him the erica kane of silicon valley  
 tim and his cofounders launched the company with two million dollars in funding they were out of cash the next year  
  lots of companies fold at that point but tim chose to fight  he maxed out eleven credit cards and racked up six figures in personal debt and it still wasn 't enough  
 so every two weeks for two years on payday he stood in front of his employees and he asked them to sacrifice their salaries  
 and it worked  more than fifty people deferred two million dollars and now more than a decade later  pandora is
  when you believe
 that there is a way around or through whatever is in front of you that surrender is not an option you can overcome enormous obstacles  
 which brings us to soap opera lesson two sacrifice your ego and drop the superiority complex  
 now this is scary it 's an acknowledgment of need or fallibility  maybe it 's even an admission that
 we 're not as special as we might like to think
 stephanie forrester of the bold and the beautiful thought she was pretty darn special she thought she was so special she didn 't need to mix with the riffraff from the valley  and she made sure valley girl brooke knew it 
 but after nearly twenty five years of epic fighting stephanie got sick and let brooke in 
  archenemies became soul mates and stephanie died in brooke 's arms and here 's our takeaway 
 drop your ego 
 life is not about you 
 it 's about us 
 and our ability to experience joy and love and to improve our reality comes only when we make ourselves vulnerable
 and we accept responsibility for our actions and our inactions
  kind of like howard schultz the ceo of starbucks 
 now after a great run as ceo howard stepped down in two thousand and starbucks quickly overextended itself and stock prices fell 
 howard rejoined the team in two thousand and eight and one of the first things he did
 was apologize to all one hundred and eighty thousand employees he apologized  and then he asked for help
  and ideas in return  and now  starbucks has more than doubled its net revenue since howard came back 
 so sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time it 's not helping anyone least of all you 
 sacrifice your ego 
 soap opera lesson three evolution is real 
 you 're not meant to be static characters on television static equals boring and boring equals
 fired characters are supposed to grow and change 
 now on tv those dynamic changes can make for some rough transitions particularly when a character is played by one person yesterday and played by someone new today  
 recasting happens all the time on soaps over the last twenty years four different actors have played the same key role of carly
  benson on general hospital 
 each new face triggered a change in the character 's life and personality  now there was always an essential nugget of carly in there 
 but the character and the story adapted to whomever was playing her  
 and here 's what that means for us  while we may not swap faces in our own lives we can evolve too we can choose to
  draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot 
 or we can open ourselves to opportunities like carly who went from nursing student to hotel owner 
 or like julia child  
 julia was a world war ii spy  
 and when the war ended she got married moved to france and decided to give culinary school a shot julia her books and
  her tv shows revolutionized the way america cooks 
 we all have the power to initiate change in our lives to evolve and adapt 
 we make the choice  but sometimes life chooses for us and we don 't get a heads up surprise slams us in the face you 're flat on the ground the air is
  died of a stroke but not really because in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four he died when his car plunged into the harbor and yet he was back in
  him  marlena shot him and he tumbled off a catwalk to his death  and so it went for thirty years 
 even when we saw the body  we knew better he 's called the phoenix for a reason
  and here 's what that means for us as long as the show is still on the air or you 're still breathing
  is permanent  resurrection is possible  now of
 course just like life soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale 
 cbs canceled my show as the world turns in december two thousand and nine and we shot our final episode in june two thousand and ten
  it was six months of dying and i rode that train right into the mountain  
 and even though we were in the middle of a huge recession and millions of people were struggling to find work 
 i somehow thought everything would be ok  so i packed up the kids and the brooklyn apartment and we moved in with my in laws in
  watched the final episode air and i realized the show was not the only fatality  i was one too  
 i was unemployed and living on the second floor of my in laws ' home  and that 's enough to make anyone feel dead inside 
 but i knew my story wasn 't over that it couldn 't be over i just had to tap into everything i
  had ever learned about soap operas  
 i had to be brave like erica and refuse to surrender so every day  i made a decision to fight  
 i had to be vulnerable like stephanie and sacrifice my ego  i had to ask for help a lot of times across many states  
 i had to be adaptable like carly and evolve my skills my
  mindset and my circumstances  and then i had to be resilient like stefano  and resurrect myself and my career like a phoenix from the ashes  
 eventually i got an interview 
 after fifteen years in news and entertainment nine months of unemployment and this one interview  
 i had an offer for an entry level job
  was thirty seven years old and i was back from the dead
  we will all experience what looks like an ending  and we can choose to make it a beginning  
 kind of like tina 
 who miraculously survived that waterfall and because i hate to leave a cliffhanger hanging tina and cord did get divorced  
 but they got remarried three times before the show went off the air in
 so remember as long as there is breath in your body  it 's never too late to change your story 
 thank you
