  i 'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey  extraordinarily rewarding journey actually  which brought me into
 training rats to save human lives
 by detecting landmines and tuberculosis
  as a child  i had two passions one was a passion for rodents  
 i had all kinds of rats  mice  hamsters 
 gerbils squirrels you name it i bred it and i sold them to pet shops 
 laughter i also had a passion for africa growing up in a multicultural environment  we had african students in the house and i learned
  about their stories  
 so different backgrounds  
 dependency on imported  know how goods  services  exuberant cultural diversity 
 africa was truly fascinating for me i became an industrial engineer engineer in product development  and i focused on appropriate detection
  appropriate technologies for developing countries i started working in the industry  but i wasn 't really happy to contribute
 to a material consumer society
 in a linear  extracting and manufacturing mode i quit my job to focus on the real world problem landmines  
 we 're talking '
  princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier
 to any development  which is really true as long as these devices are there or there is suspicion of landmines you can 't really enter into the land  actually there was an appeal worldwide
 for new detectors sustainable
 in the environments where they 're needed to produce which is mainly in the developing world  we chose rats why would you choose rats
  vermin  well actually rats are in contrary to what most people think about them rats are highly sociable
 creatures and actually  our product what you see here there 's a target somewhere here 
 you see an operator a trained african with his rats in front who actually
 are left and right  there the animal finds a mine it scratches on the soil and the animal comes back
  for a food reward  very very simple very sustainable in this environment 
 here the animal gets its food reward  and that 's how it works  very very simple 
 now why would you use rats rats have been used since the ' 50s last century in all kinds of
  more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species 
 they 're extremely sensitive to smell  moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it 
 now how do we communicate with rats well
  don 't talk rat  but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there
 with which you can reinforce particular behaviors first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe 
 once the animal knows click food click food click food so click is food
 we bring it in a cage with a hole  and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed
 and to do that for five seconds five seconds  which is long for a rat once the animal knows this we make the task a bit more difficult  
 it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes up to ten holes  
 then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets
 in the next step  animals learn to find real mines in real minefields
  and accredited according to international mine action standards just like dogs have to pass a test this consists of four hundred square meters there 's 
 a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all
  if the animal does that it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field
 just like dogs by the way  maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog 
 this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer 
 who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people 
 they have a skill
  which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid  moreover this small team
 together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual  de miners to follow up but
 with this small investment in a rat capacity  we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the
  per square meter
 up to sixty percent of what is currently normal two dollars per square meter we do it at $ one point one eight and we can still bring that price down question of scale if you can bring in more rats  we can actually make the output even
 bigger  we have a demonstration site in mozambique  
 eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology  they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region
 and
 they endorse hero rats
 to clear their common borders of landmines  
 but let me bring you to a very different problem and there 's about six thousand people last year that walked on a landmine 
 but worldwide last year almost one point nine million died from tuberculosis as a
  reaches from forty to sixty percent reliability in tanzania the numbers don 't lie forty five percent of people
  it means that if you have t b 
 you have more chance that you won 't be detected but will just die from
 t b secondary infections and so on and
 if however  you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in
  to the smell of tar already the old chinese and the greek  hippocrates have actually
  can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from
 patients 
 so what we did is we collected some samples just as a way of testing from hospitals  trained rats on them
 and
 see see if this works  and wonder well  we can reach eighty nine percent sensitivity eighty six percent specificity using
 multiple rats in a row this is how it works
  and really this is a generic technology we 're talking now explosives tuberculosis but can you imagine you can actually put
 anything under there so how does it work you have a cassette with ten samples you put these ten samples at once in the cage an
 animal only needs two hundredths of a second
  goes extremely fast here it 's already at the third sample this is a positive sample it
 gets a click sound and comes for the food reward 
 and by doing so very fast we can have like a second line opinion
 to see which patients are positive which are negative 
  whereas a microscopist can
 process forty samples in a day a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only 
 a cage like this 
 a cage like this provided that you have rats and we have now currently twenty five tuberculosis rats
  a cage like this operating throughout the day can process one thousand six hundred and eighty samples 
 can you imagine the potential offspring applications environmental detection of pollutants in soils
  customs applications detection of illicit goods in containers and so on 
 but let 's stick first to tuberculosis  i just want to briefly highlight the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only
 the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of five hundred thousand people where fifteen thousand reported to get a test done 
 microscopy for one thousand eight hundred patients and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back 
 we were able to increase case detection rates by over thirty percent throughout last year we 've been
 depending on which
  intervals you take we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between thirty and forty percent 
 so this is really considerable knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to fifteen people  healthy people per year
  you can be sure that
 we have saved lots of lives at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives
  the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology  
 and there are simple things like for instance  we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds so to standardize this also to standardize the pellets the food rewards  
 and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people
 to conclude there are also other applications at the horizon here is a first prototype of our camera rat  which is a rat with a rat backpack
  with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on this is in a prototype stage we don 't have a working system here yet 
  projects  but in the end it is about people it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult  
 expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and doing that with a local resource  plenty available 
 so something completely different
 is to keep on challenging
 your perception about
 the resources surrounding you
  whether they are environmental technological animal or human and
 to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world  thank you very much
