  has anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas  tear gas anyone 
 i 'm sorry to hear that so you might know that it 's a very toxic substance
  but you might not know that it 's a very simple molecule with an unpronouncable name it 's called
 i made it it
 's decades old  but it 's becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately it seems 
 and according to my experience as a non voluntary breather of it 
 tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects one  it can really
  burn your eyes and two it can also help you to open them
 tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that i want to share with you this afternoon that 
 the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be 
 in journalism in activism  and as i see it in the political
 discourse as well  that idea started to dawn on me in early two thousand and eleven when i was
 covering a protest in so paulo  it was the marijuana march a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis 
 when that group started to move the riot police came from the back with rubber bullets  bombs  and then the gas
 but to make a long story short i had entered that protest as the 
  printed magazine where i 'd worked for eleven years  
 and thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas  i left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways
 of sharing the raw experience of what
  like to
 be there actually  so in the following week  i was back in the streets 
 but that time  i wasn 't a member of any media outlet anymore  i was there as an independent livestreamer 
 and all i had with me was basically borrowed equipment  i had
 a very simple camera
  that could be shared through social media could be put in any website
 and that time the protest went along fine there was no violence there was no action scenes but there was something really exciting
 because i could see at a distance the tv channels covering
  and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras  and i was basically doing the same thing and all i had was a backpack  
 and that was really exciting to a journalist but the most interesting part was when i got back home actually  because
 i learned that i had been watched by more than ninety thousand people  
 and i got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me basically how did i do it
 how it was possible to do such a thing and i learned something else that that was actually the first time that somebody had ever done
 a livestreaming in a street
 protest in the country  
 and that really shocked me  
 because i was no geek i was no technology guy  and all the equipment needed was already there was easily available
 and i realized that we had a frontier here a very important one that it was just a matter of changing the perspective 
 and the web could be actually used already used as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical tv channel tv network  
 and anyone with very basic
  even someone like me could become a broadcaster  
 and that sounded revolutionary in my mind so for the next couple of years  i started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways not only in the streets but mostly in studios and
  beginning of two thousand and thirteen last year when i became the cofounder of a group called mdia ninja  ninja is an acronym that stands for 
 in english independent narratives journalism  and action  
 it was a media group that had little media plan we didn 't have any financial structure  we were not planning to make money out of this which was
  wise because you shouldn 't try to make money out of journalism now but
 we had a very solid and clear conviction that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media
 could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the
  so we launched a facebook page first  and then a manifesto  
 and started to cover the streets in a very simple way  but then something happened something that wasn 't
 predicted that no one could have anticipated  
 street protests started to erupt in so paulo they began as very local and specific they were against
 the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city this is a bus it 's written there
 theft but
 those kind of manifestations started to to grow  and they kept happening  
 so the police violence against them started to grow as well  
 but there was another conflict the one i believe that 's more important here to make my point that
  there was this mainstream media version of the facts
 that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge
 if they
 presented their own vision of what was actually happening there and it was this clash of visions this clash of narratives that i think
 turned those protests
 into a long period in the country of political reckoning
 where
 hundreds of thousands of people
  more than a million people took to the streets in the whole country  
 but it wasn 't about the bus fare hike anymore  it was about everything 
 the people 's demands their expectations the reasons why they were on the streets could be as diverse as
 they could be contradictory in many cases  if you could read it you would understand me
 was in this environment of political catharsis that the country was going through
 that it had to do with politics  indeed but it had to do also with a new way of organizing through a new way of communicating it
 was in that environment that mdia ninja emerged from almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon
  did have the right equipment  we are not using big cameras  we are using basically this  
 we are using smartphones  
 and that actually allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests  
 but it allowed us to do something else to show what it was like to be in the
  people at home a subjective
 perspective  
 but there was something that is more important i think than the equipment it was our mindset  because we are not behaving as a media outlet
 we are not competing for news  we are trying to encourage people to invite people and to actually teach people how to do this how they also
  and that was crucial to turn mdia ninja from
 from a small group of people and in a matter of weeks  we multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country  
 so in a matter of a week or two as the protests kept happening
  we were hundreds of young people connected in this network throughout the country  we were covering more than fifty cities at the same time that 's something that no tv channel could ever do
 that was responsible for turning us suddenly actually into kind of the mainstream media of social media  
 so we had a couple of thousands of followers on our facebook page and soon we had a quarter of a million followers 
 our posts and our videos were being seen by more than
  eleven million timelines a week it was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do  
 and that turned mdia ninja into something else more than a media outlet than a media project  
 it became almost like a public service
 to the citizen to the protester to the activist because they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool
 to confront both police and media
 authority
 many of our images started to be used in regular tv channels our livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular 
  televisions when things got really rough some our images were responsible
  also turned mdia ninja very soon to be seen as almost an enemy of cops  unfortunately  
 and we started to be severely beaten and eventually arrested on the streets it happened in many cases  
 but that was also useful because we were still at the web so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself
 and the state of the freedom of the press in the country 
 so mdia ninja now evolved and finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it
 it would become a national network of hundreds of young people
  what i started to do in the beginning of this year as mdia ninja is already a 
 dedicating myself to another project it 's called fluxo which is portuguese for 
  it 's a journalism studio in so paulo downtown where i used livestream to experiment with what i call 
 formats  but i 'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent
 journalism through a direct relationship with an audience with an active audience  because now i really want to try to make a living out of my tear gas
  there 's something more significant here something that i believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example  
 i said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal tv network  but i believe it does something else  because after watching
 people using it not only to cover things but to express to organize themselves politically
  i believe livestream can turn cyberspace
 into a global political arena where everyone might have a voice a proper voice  
 because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast
 political discourse of the verbal aspect of the political dialogue out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone  
 and it empowers the citizen through this direct and
  power of exchanging experiences and dialogue empowers them to
 question and to influence authorities in ways in which we are about to see  
 and i believe it does something else that might be even more important that
 the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity in a very political way as i see it
 because it really helps
 the audience the citizen to see the world through somebody else 's eye  so it helps the citizen
 to put him or herself in other people 's place  
 and that idea i think should be the intention  should be the goal of any good journalism any good activism  but most of all 
 any good politics  thank you very much it was an honor
