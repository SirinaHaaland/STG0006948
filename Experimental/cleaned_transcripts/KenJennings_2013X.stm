  two weeks time that 's the ninth anniversary of the day i first stepped out onto that hallowed 
 jeopardy set i mean nine years is a long time and given jeopardy 's average demographics i think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show
 are now dead
  all a few are still alive occasionally i still get recognized at the mall or whatever and when i do it 's as a bit of a know it all i think
 that ship has sailed it 's too late for me for better or for worse that 's what i 'm going to be known as as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff and
 i can 't complain about this i feel like that was always sort of my destiny although i had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet if nothing else you realize very quickly as a
  teenager it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk 's middle name  
 and as a result i was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know it all for many years but if you if you go further back if you look at it  it 's all there i was the kind of kid who was always bugging 
  mom and dad with whatever great fact i had just read about haley 's comet or giant squids or the size of the world 's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was i now have a
  of my own who 's exactly the same and i know how deeply annoying it is so karma does work  
 and i loved game shows fascinated with game shows i remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine because it had just hit me as badly as i wanted to go to school that i was also going to miss hollywood squares
  came back on the air i remember running home from school every day to watch the show  it was my  my favorite show even before it paid for my house  and
 we lived overseas we lived in south korea where my dad was working where there was only one english language tv channel there was armed forces tv and if you didn 't speak korean  that 's what you were watching so me and all my friends would run home every day and watch jeopardy i was always that kind of
  obsessed trivia kid i remember
 being able to play trivial pursuit against my parents back in the ' 80s and holding my own back when that was a fad there 's a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that 
  mom and dad don 't know you know some beatles factoid that dad didn 't know and you think
  i never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path  that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex game show contestant
  and so i sold out way too young i didn 't try to figure out what one does with that i studied computers because i heard that was the thing  and i became a computer programmer not an especially good one not an especially happy one at
  time when i was first on jeopardy in two thousand and four  but that 's what i was doing and it made it doubly ironic my computer background
 a few years later i think
 two thousand and nine or so when i got another phone call from jeopardy saying it 's early days yet but ibm tells us they want to build
 a supercomputer to beat you at ' jeopardy ' are you up for this
  course i said yes for several reasons one because playing jeopardy is a great time it 's fun it 's the most fun you can have with your pants on 
  and i would do it for nothing  i don 't think they know that luckily  but i would i would go back and play for arby 's coupons i just love jeopardy and i always have and second of all because
  a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future people playing computers on game shows
 was the kind of thing i always imagined would happen in the future and now i could be on the stage with it i was not going to say no  the third reason i said yes is because i was pretty confident that i was going to win i had taken some artificial 
  intelligence classes i knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on jeopardy people don 't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can
  clue in a natural language like english and understand all the double meanings the puns the red herrings  unpack the meaning of the clue the kind of thing that a 
 human little kid could do very hard for a computer 
 and i thought well this is going to be child 's play yes i will come destroy the computer and
 defend defend my species laughter
  started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this i started to get occasional updates from them and
 i started to get a little more worried i remember a journal article about this new question answering
 software that had a graph it was a scatter chart showing
 performance on jeopardy tens of thousands of dots representing jeopardy champions up at the top with their performance plotted
  on number of 
 i was going to say questions answered but answers questioned i guess  clues responded to
 versus the accuracy of those answers  so there 's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to and at first it was very low there was no software that could compete at this kind of arena  
 but then you see the line start to go up and it 's getting very close to what they call the winner 's cloud  and i noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots
  the black dots in the upper right represent 74 time ' jeopardy ' champion ken jennings 
 and i saw this line coming for me and i realized this is it this is what it looks like when the future comes for you it
 's not the the terminator 's gun sight
  it 's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do the only thing that makes you special the thing you 're best at 
 when the game eventually happened about a year later  it was very different than the jeopardy games i 'd been used to we were not playing in l a on the regular jeopardy set watson
 does not travel watson 's actually huge  it 's
 thousands of processors a terabyte of memory trillions of bytes of memory we got to walk through his climate controlled server room
  contestant to this day i 've ever been inside  and
 so watson does not travel  you must come to it  you must make the pilgrimage so me and the other human player wound up at this
 secret ibm research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in westchester county to play the computer and we realized
 right away that the computer had a big home court advantage there was a big
 watson logo in the middle of the stage like you 're going to play the chicago bulls and there 's the thing in the middle of their court and the crowd was full of 
  v p s and programmers cheering on their little darling having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up and
 holding up go watson signs and just
 applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right
  written on their bellies in grease paint if you can imagine computer programmers
 with with the letters w a t s o n written on their gut it 's an unpleasant sight  
 but they were right  they were exactly right i don 't want to spoil it if you still have this sitting on your dvr but watson won handily
  and i remember standing there behind the podium as i could hear that little insectoid
  a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer and you could hear that little tick tick tick tick and i remember thinking 
 this is it i felt obsolete  i felt like
 a detroit factory worker of the ' 80s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line i felt like
 quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime
  and it hasn 't been the last if you watch the news you
 'll see occasionally and i see this all the time that
 pharmacists now there 's a machine that can fill prescriptions
 automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist and a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there 's software that can sum up
 case laws and legal briefs and decisions you don 't need human assistants for that anymore i read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and
  spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it  and obviously these new technologies can 't
 do as clever or creative a job as the humans they 're replacing but they 're faster and crucially they 're much much cheaper  so
 it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be i 've read economists saying that  as a result of these new technologies we 'll enter a new golden age of leisure
  time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by watson and his digital
 brethren  
 i 've heard other people say quite the opposite that this is yet another tier of the middle class that 's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous something that we should worry about 
 i 'm not an economist myself all i know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work
  and it was friggin ' demoralizing  
 it was terrible here 's the one thing that i was ever good at and all it took was ibm pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel 
 and they could do the same thing they could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national tv  and i 'm sorry ken we don 't need you anymore 
  start outsourcing 
 not just lower unimportant brain functions i 'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers when we knew our friends ' phone numbers  and suddenly there was a machine that did that and now we don 't need to remember that anymore  
 i have read that there 's now actually evidence that
 the hippocampus the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like gps
  because we 're not exercising our sense of direction anymore we 're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard and as a result a part of our brain that 's supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber  
 and it made me think what happens
 when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are
 is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy
  are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less
 as somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know this was a terrifying idea to
 the more i thought about it i realized no
 it 's still important  the things we know are still important i came to believe there were two advantages
 that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who
  says oh yeah i can google that hold on a second 
 there 's an advantage of volume and there 's an advantage of time the advantage of volume first just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays there 's so much information out there being a renaissance man or woman 
  that 's something that was only possible in the renaissance now it 's really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor
  there 's just too much
  they say that the scope of human information is now doubling every eighteen months or so the sum total of human information that means between now and
 late two thousand and fourteen we will generate as much information in terms of
 gigabytes as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together it 's doubling every eighteen months now 
 this is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds
 of facts
  like
 where do i go to school what should i major in who do i vote for 
 do i take this job or that one these are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts 
 if we have those facts at our mental fingertips we 're going to be able to make informed decisions 
 if on the other hand we need to look them all up 
  we may be in trouble according to a national geographic survey i just saw somewhere along the lines of
 eighty percent of the people who vote in a u s presidential election about issues like foreign policy
 cannot find iraq or afghanistan on a map  if you can 't do that first step are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you 're going to need to know to master
 your knowledge of u s foreign policy quite probably not at some point you 're just going to be like you know what there 's too much to
  make a less informed decision the other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips i always think of the story
 of a little girl named tilly smith she was
 a  10 year old girl from surrey england on vacation with her parents a few years ago in phuket thailand she runs up to them on the beach one morning and says mom dad we 've got to get off the beach 
 and they say what do you mean we just got here and she said
  kearney 's geography class last month he told us
 that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there  that 's the sign of a tsunami  and you need to clear the beach 
 what would you do if your 10 year old daughter came up to you with this her parents thought about it  and they finally to their credit decided to believe her they told the lifeguard they went back to the hotel and the lifeguard cleared over one hundred people off the beach
  luckily because that was the day of the boxing day
  the day after christmas two thousand and four  that killed thousands of people in southeast asia and around the indian ocean
 but not on that beach not on mai khao beach because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher
 a month before now when when facts come in handy like that i love that story because it shows you the power
 of one fact one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time
 normally something that 's easier to see on game shows than in real life but in this case it happened in real life and it happens in real life all the
  time  it 's not always a tsunami often it 's a social situation it 's a
 meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge you say where you 're from and i 
  say oh yeah or your alma mater or your job  and i know just a little something about it enough to get the ball rolling people love that shared connection that gets created when when
 to get to know you before you even met  that 's often the advantage of time and it 's not effective if you say well hold on you 're from fargo north dakota let me
 see what comes up oh yeah roger maris was from fargo that doesn 't work  that 's just annoying
  samuel parr once said it 's always better to know a thing
 than not to know it 
 and if i have lived my life by any kind of creed  it 's probably that i have always believed that the things we know that knowledge is an absolute good
 that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are as individuals and as a species i don 't know if i want to live in a
  world where knowledge is obsolete  i don 't want to live in a world where
 cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization
 together i don 't want to be the last trivia know it all sitting on a mountain somewhere reciting to himself the state capitals and the
  episodes and the lyrics of abba songs  
 i feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices to our search engines and our smartphones 
 in the movies 
 when computers like watson start to think things don 't always end well   those movies are never about beautiful
  it 's always
 a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in two thousand and one things always go terribly wrong  
 and i feel like we 're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in this is a question of leadership because it becomes a question of
 who leads the future on the one hand we can choose between
 a new golden age where information is more
  universally available than it 's ever been in human history where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips  
 and on the other hand we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we 've all decided it 's not important what we know anymore that knowledge isn 't valuable because it 's all out there in the cloud and why would we ever bother learning anything
  those are the two choices we have i know which future i would rather be living in and we can all make that choice we make that choice by being curious inquisitive people who like to learn who don 't just say 
 well as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over i don 't have to learn anymore or thank goodness i have my diploma  i 'm done learning for a lifetime i don 't have to learn new things anymore no every day we should be striving
  us  that 's where the people you see on jeopardy come from these know it alls they 're not rainman style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book i 've met a lot of them for the most part they are just normal folks
 who are universally interested in the world around them curious about everything thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject  
 we can live in one of these two worlds we can live in a world where
 our brains the things that we know continue to be the thing
  that makes us special or a world in which we 've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like watson ladies and gentlemen  the choice is yours
