  i was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet  dip both hands into holy water  trace the trinity across my chest my tiny body drooping like a question mark all over the wooden
 pew  i asked jesus to fix me and when he did not answer
 i befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue but shame lingered as an aftertaste and in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity my mother told me of the miracle i was 
  i could grow up to be anything i want i decided to
 be a boy 
 it was cute  i had snapback toothless grin used skinned knees as street cred  played hide and seek with what was left of my goal i was it the winner to a game the other kids 
  couldn 't play  i was the mystery of an anatomy a question asked but not answered tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl  and when i turned twelve 
  met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home that i exist 
 for heterosexual marriage and child bearing and i swallowed their insults along with their slurs  
  lesbian but i was more boy than girl more ken than barbie it had nothing to do with hating my body i just love it enough to let it go  i treat it like a house and when your house is falling 
  apart  you do not evacuate you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides you make it pretty enough to invite guests over you make the floorboards strong
 strong enough to stand on my mother
 fears i have named myself after fading things 
 as she counts the echoes left behind by mya hall leelah alcorn  blake brockington  she fears that i 'll die without a whisper  that i 'll turn into what a shame conversations 
  at the bus stop she claims i have turned myself into a mausoleum that i am a walking casket  news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle  bruce jenner on everyone 's lips while the brutality of living in this
  body becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages  no one ever thinks of us as human
 because we are more ghost than flesh because people fear that my gender expression is a trick  that it exists to be perverse  that it ensnares them without their consent that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands and once they have fed off my queer
  all the parts they did not like they 'll put me back into the closet  hang me with all the other skeletons i will be the best attraction  
 can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins 
 to misspell their names on gravestones and people still wonder why there are boys rotting they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second afraid 
 of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day and now
  is embracing more transgender children than parents
 i wonder how long it will be before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant 
 before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin way before we learn how to love them like god didn didn 't save all this breath and mercy  like my blood is not the wine that washed over jesus ' feet my prayers
 are now getting stuck
  in my throat  maybe i am finally fixed  maybe i just don 't care maybe
 god finally listened to my prayers
