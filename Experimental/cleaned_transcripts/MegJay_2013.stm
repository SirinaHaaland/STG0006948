  i saw my very first psychotherapy client  
 i was a ph d student in clinical psychology at berkeley  she was a  26 year old woman named
  now alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top  
 and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems  
 now when i heard this i was so relieved my classmate got an arsonist for her first client 
 and i got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys this i thought i could handle
 but i didn 't handle it 
 with the funny stories that alex would bring to session it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road 
 thirty 's the new twenty alex would say  and as far as i could tell she was right 
 work happened later marriage happened later kids happened later even death happened later twentysomethings like alex and i had nothing but time
 but before long my supervisor pushed me to push alex about her love life  
 i pushed back  i said sure she 's dating down she 's sleeping with a knucklehead 
 but it 's not like she 's going to marry the guy 
 and then my supervisor said not yet  but she might marry the next one besides the best time to work
  on alex 's marriage is before she has one 
 that 's what psychologists call an aha moment  that was the moment i realized thirty is not the new twenty  
 yes people settle down later than they used to but that didn 't make alex 's  20s a developmental downtime that made alex 's 20s a developmental sweet spot  and we were sitting there blowing it
 that was when i realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem  and it had real consequences 
 not just for alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere 
 there are fifty million twentysomethings in the united states right now we 're talking about fifteen percent of the
  population or one hundred percent if you consider that no one 's getting through adulthood without going through their 
 raise your hand if you 're in your 20s i really want to see some twentysomethings here oh yay you are
 all awesome if you work with twentysomethings you love a twentysomething you 're losing sleep over twentysomethings i want to see
 okay  awesome twentysomethings really matter
 so i specialize in twentysomethings because i believe that every single one of those fifty million twentysomethings deserves to know 
 what psychologists sociologists neurologists and fertility specialists
  yet most transformative things you can do for work for love for your happiness  maybe even for the world 
 this is not my opinion these are the facts 
 we know that eighty percent of life 's most defining moments take place by age 
 that means that eight out of ten of the decisions and experiences and aha moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your
 people who are over forty don 't panic this crowd is going to be fine i think 
 we know that the first ten years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you 're going to earn 
 we know that more than half of americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by thirty  
 we know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your
  as it rewires itself for adulthood  which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself now is the time to change it 
 we know that personality changes more during your  20s than at any other time in life  
 and we know that female fertility peaks at age twenty eight and things
  the time to educate yourself about your body
 and your options  so when we think about child development we all know that the first five years are a critical period
 for language and attachment in the brain  it 's a time when your ordinary day to day life has an inordinate impact on who you
  but what we hear less about is that there 's such a thing as adult development  and our  20s are that critical period of adult development  
 but this isn 't what twentysomethings are hearing  
 newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood  researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence 
 journalists coin silly nicknames for
  as a culture we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood  
 leonard bernstein said that to achieve great things you need a plan
 and not quite enough time isn
 't that true  so what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say you have ten extra years to start your life
 nothing happens you have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition  and absolutely nothing happens  
 and then every day smart interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this 
 i know my boyfriend 's no good for me but this relationship doesn 't count
  i 'm just killing time 
 or they say everybody says as long as i get started on a career by the time i 'm thirty i 'll be fine 
 but then it starts to sound like this 
 my 20s are almost over and i have nothing to show for myself i had a better rsum the day after i graduated from college 
 and then it starts to sound like this
  dating in my 20s was like musical chairs everybody was running around and having fun  
 but then sometime around thirty it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down 
 i didn 't want to be the only one left standing up so sometimes i think i married my husband
 because he was the closest chair to me at thirty where are the twentysomethings here
  now that sounds a little flip  but make no mistake the stakes are very high 
 when a lot has been pushed to your 30s there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump start a career pick a city 
 partner up  and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time 
 many of these things are incompatible and as research is just starting to show  simply harder and more stressful to do
 all at once in our 30s 
 the post millennial midlife crisis isn 't buying a red sports car  
 it 's realizing you can 't have that career you now want  
 it 's realizing you can 't have that child you now want or you can 't give your child a sibling 
 too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves and at me
  sitting across the room and say about their 20s what was i doing what was i thinking 
 i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking 
 here 's a story about how that can go  it 's a story about a woman named emma 
  emma came to my office because she was in her words having an identity crisis 
 she said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment  but she hadn 't decided yet  so she 'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead 
 because it was cheaper she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition  
 and as hard as her  20s were her early life had been even harder she often cried in our sessions
  but then would collect herself by saying you can 't pick your family but you can pick your friends 
 well one day emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap and she sobbed for most of the hour 
 she 'd just bought a new address book  and she 'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts  but then she 'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words
  case of emergency please call 
 she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said who 's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck who 's going to take care of me if i have cancer 
 now in that moment it took everything i had not to say i will 
 but what emma needed wasn 't some therapist who really really cared emma needed a better life
 i knew this was her chance
  i had learned too much since i first worked with alex to just sit there while emma 's defining decade
 went parading by  
 so over the next weeks and months  i told emma three things that every twentysomething male or female deserves to hear 
 first
  told emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital 
 by get identity capital i mean do something that adds value to who you are 
 do something that 's an investment in who you might want to be next 
 i didn 't know the future of emma 's career  and no one knows the future of work  but i do know this identity capital
 begets identity capital  so now is the time for that cross country job that internship that startup you want to try  
 i 'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here  but i am discounting exploration that 's not supposed to count  
 which by the way is not exploration 
  i told emma to explore work and make it count  
 second  i told emma that the urban tribe is overrated  
 best friends are great for giving rides to the airport but twentysomethings who huddle together with like minded peers limit who they know 
 what they know how they think how they
  and where they work
  that new piece of capital that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle new things come from what are called our weak ties our friends of friends of friends  
 so yes half of twentysomethings are un or under employed 
 but half aren 't and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group
  half of new jobs are never posted so reaching out to your neighbor 's boss is how you get that unposted job  
 it 's not cheating it 's the science of how information spreads 
 last but not least emma believed that you can 't pick your family but you can pick your friends  
 now this was true for her growing up but as a twentysomething soon emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own  
 i told
  emma the time to start picking your family is now 
 now you may be thinking that thirty is actually a better time to settle down than twenty  or even 
 and i agree with you but grabbing whoever you 're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is
  the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work 
 picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want
 rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you  so what happened to
  we went through that address book  and she found an old roommate 's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state  
 that weak tie helped her get a job there that job offer gave her the reason to leave that live in boyfriend 
 now five years later she 's a special events planner for museums she 's married to a man she mindfully chose  she loves her new career she loves her new family  and she sent me a card that said now the emergency
  contact blanks don 't seem big enough 
 now emma 's story made that sound easy but that 's what i love about working with twentysomethings they are so easy to help 
 twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving lax  bound for somewhere west 
 right after takeoff a slight change in course is the difference between landing in alaska or fiji
 or even twenty nine 
 one good conversation one good break one good ted talk can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come 
 so here 's an idea worth spreading to every
  twentysomething you know  it 's as simple as what i learned to say to alex it 's what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma
 every single day 
 thirty is not the new twenty  so claim your adulthood  get some identity capital  use your weak ties  pick your family  
 don 't be defined by what you didn 't know or didn 't do you 're deciding your life right now  thank you
