  so i 'm a
 city planner an urban designer  former arts advocate  trained in architecture and
 art history  and i want to talk to you today not about design
 but about america
 and how america
  can be
 more economically resilient how america can be healthier  and how america can be more environmentally sustainable  
 and i realize this is a global forum  
 but i think i need to talk about america because there is a history in some places not all of american ideas being appropriated being
 being emulated for better or for worse around the world and the worst idea we 've ever had is suburban sprawl  
 it 's being emulated in many places as we speak by suburban sprawl i refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape
 around the
 requirement of automobile use and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a
  prosthetic device that many of us need just to most americans in fact need just to live their
 daily lives and there 's an alternative you know
 we say half the world is living in cities well in america that living in cities for many of them they 're living in cities still where they 're dependent on that automobile 
 and what i work
 for and to do is to
  make our cities more walkable but i can 't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that i 've learned
 from the economists the epidemiologists and the environmentalists so these are the three arguments that i 'm going to give you
 quickly today  when i was growing up in the ' 70s the typical american spent one tenth of their income american family on
  since then we 've doubled the number of roads in america and we now spend one fifth of our income
 on transportation  
 working families which are defined as earning between twenty thousand and fifty thousand dollars a year in america are spending more now on transportation than on housing  slightly more  
 because of this phenomenon called drive till you qualify 
 finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs  so that they 're locked in this
 three hours four hours a day of commuting  and these are the neighborhoods for example in the central valley of california
 that weren 't hurt
 when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up they were
 decimated and in fact these are many of the  half vacant communities that you see today  imagine
  everything you have into your mortgage it goes underwater  and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you 're doing so
 we know what it 's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars what happens when a city decides it 's going to set other priorities and probably the best example we have here in america is portland oregon 
 portland made a bunch of decisions
  that began to distinguish it from almost every other american city  while most other cities were growing
 an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl  they instituted an urban growth boundary  
 while most cities were reaming out their roads removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic  
 they instituted a skinny streets program 
 and while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways  they actually
  invested in bicycling and in walking  and they spent sixty million dollars on bike facilities which seems like a lot of money but it was spent over about
 thirty years so two million dollars a year not that much and half the price of the one cloverleaf
 that they decided to rebuild in that city  these changes and others like them
  traveled per day the amount that each person drives actually peaked in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six 
 has been dropping ever since  and they now drive twenty percent less than the rest of the country  the typical portland citizen drives
 four miles less and eleven minutes less per day than they did before  
 the economist joe cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those eleven minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all
 income earned in the region  
 so if they 're not spending that money on driving and by the way eighty five percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy if they 're not spending that money on driving what are they spending it on  
 well portland is reputed to have the most
 roof racks per capita  the most independent bookstores per capita  the most
  these are all exaggerations slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth which is portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of america 
 actually oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states which may be a good thing or a bad thing but it makes you glad they 're driving less 
 but actually they 're spending most of it in their homes and home home investment is about as local
 an investment as you can get
  but there 's a whole other portland story which isn 't part of this calculus  which is that young educated people
 have been moving to portland in droves  so that between the last two censuses  they had a 50 percent increase
 in  college educated millennials  which is five times what you saw anywhere else
 in the country or i should say of the national average  so on the one hand a city saves money for its residents by
 being more walkable and more bikeable 
 but on the other hand  it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days  so the best economic strategy you can have as a city
 is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a
 medical cluster or an aerospace cluster  but to become a place where people want to be and millennials
  these engines of entrepreneurship sixty four percent of whom decide first where they want to live  then they move there then they look for a job  they will come to your city  
 the health argument is a scary one  
 and you 've probably heard part of this argument before  again back in the ' 70s a lot 's changed since then  back in the ' 70s one in ten americans was obese 
 now one out of three americans
  obese  and a second third of the population is overweight
 twenty five percent of young men and forty percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces  
 according to the center for disease control fully one third of all children born after two thousand will get diabetes 
 we have the first generation of children in america who are predicted to live shorter lives
  parents i believe that this american healthcare crisis that we 've all heard about
 is an urban design crisis and that the design of our cities lies at the cure  because we 've talked a long time about diet 
 and we know that diet impacts weight  and weight of course impacts health  
 but we 've only started talking about inactivity
  and how inactivity born of our landscape inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk 
 is driving our weight up  and we finally have the studies one in britain called gluttony versus sloth 
 that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity and found a much higher 
 stronger correlation
 between the latter two 
 test subjects in electronic underwear  
 held their diet steady  and then started pumping the calories in some people gained weight some people didn 't gain weight expecting some metabolic or dna factor at work 
 they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving  
  than those who didn 't 
 so we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity  but even more we now have studies that tie weight to where you live do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city or where in your city do you live 
 in san diego they used walk score
 walk score rates every address in america and soon the world
 in terms of how walkable it is they used walk score to designate more walkable neighborhoods
 and less walkable neighborhoods well guess what if you lived in a more walkable neighborhood you were thirty five percent likely to be overweight  
 if you lived in a less walkable neighborhood you were sixty percent likely to be overweight  so we have study after study now
 that 's tying where you live to your health  particularly as in america the biggest health crisis we have is this one that 's
  and i learned a new word last week  they call these neighborhoods 
 i may have that wrong but you get the idea 
 now that 's one thing of course  briefly mentioning we have an asthma epidemic in this country you probably haven 't thought that much about it fourteen americans die each day from asthma 
 three times what it was in the '
  and it 's almost all coming from car exhaust american pollution does not come from factories anymore it comes from tailpipes  and the amount that people are driving in your city  your urban vmt 
 is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city  and then finally in terms of driving 
  fact here in america  twelve people out of every one hundred thousand die every year from car crashes we
 're pretty safe here well guess what in england it 's seven per one hundred thousand it 's japan it 's four per one hundred thousand do you know where it 's three per one hundred thousand 
 new york city  san francisco the same thing portland the same thing oh so cities
  make us safer because we 're driving less 
 tulsa  fourteen per one hundred thousand orlando  twenty per one hundred thousand it
 's not whether you 're in the city or not it 's how is your city designed was it designed
 around cars or around people because if your city is designed around cars  it 's really good at smashing them into each other 
 that 's part of a much larger health argument finally the environmental argument is fascinating because the environmentalists turned
  on a dime
 about ten years ago the environmental movement in america has historically been an anti city movement from jefferson on 
 cities are pestilential to the health to the liberties to the morals of man if we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities as they do in europe we shall become as corrupt as they are in europe and take to eating one another as they do
  he apparently had a sense of humor
  and then the american environmental movement has been a classically arcadian movement to become more environmental we move into the country we commune with nature we build
 suburbs  but of course we 've seen what that does 
 the carbon mapping of america where is the co2 being emitted for many years only
 hammered this argument in more strongly
  if you look at any carbon map because we map it per square mile any carbon map of the u s it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the u s hottest in the cities cooler in the suburbs  dark  peaceful
 in the countryside  
 until some economists said you know is that the right way to measure co2 
 there are only so many people in this country at any given time and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact and they said let 's measure
  per household and when they did that the maps just flipped  coolest in the center city  
 warmer in the suburbs  and red hot in these exurban drive till you qualify 
 neighborhoods  
 so a fundamental shift and now you have you have environmentalists and economists like ed glaeser saying we are a destructive species  if you love nature the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it 
 move to
  and the denser the better and the denser cities like manhattan are the cities that perform the best 
 so the average manhattanite is consuming gasoline
 at the rate the rest of the nation hasn 't seen since the since the ' 20s consuming
 half of the electricity
 of dallas  but of course  we can do better canadian cities they consume half the gasoline of american cities  
 european cities consume half as much again  
 so obviously we can do better
  and we want to do better and we 're all trying to be green 
 my final argument in this topic is that i think we 're trying to be green the wrong way  
 and i 'm one of many people who believes that this focus on
 gadgets on accessorizing
 what can i add to my house what can i add to what i 've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable has kind of
  dominated the discussion so i 'm not immune to this my wife and i built a new house on an abandoned lot in washington d c 
 and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store  
 we 've got the solar photovoltaic system solar hot water heater dual flush toilets bamboo floors 
 a log burning in my
  contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest  yet all of these innovations that 's that 's what they said in the brochure 
 all of these innovations together contribute
 a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city
  we 've changed all our light bulbs to energy savers and you should do the same thing but changing all your light bulbs to energy savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week  
 and we don 't want to have this argument politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green
 as a lifestyle choice you don 't want to tell americans god forbid that they have to change their lifestyle 
 but what if lifestyle was was really about quality of life
 and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more something that would be better
  than what we have right now well
 the gold standard of quality of life rankings it 's called the mercer survey you may have heard of it they rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to ten criteria that they believe add up to quality of life 
 health  
 economics  education housing 
 you name it there 's six more short talk
  and it 's very interesting to see that
 the highest ranking american city honolulu number twenty eight 
 is followed by kind of the usual suspects of seattle and boston and all walkable cities the driving cities in the sun belt  the dallases and the
 phoenixes and sorry atlanta these cities are not appearing
 on the list  but who 's doing even better  the canadian cities like vancouver
 where again they 're burning half the fuel  and then it 's usually won by cities where they speak german like dusseldorf or vienna where they 're burning again half as much fuel  and you see this alignment this strange alignment 
 is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life 
 i would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life and that 's living
  walkable neighborhood  so sustainability which includes
 our wealth and our health
 may not be a direct function
 of our sustainability  but particularly here in america  we are polluting so much
 because we 're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway  then these two problems would seem to share the
  same solution  which is to make our cities more walkable 
 doing so isn 't easy but it can be done it has been done  and it 's being done now in more than a few cities around the globe and in our country 
 i take some solace from
 winston churchill who put it this way the americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives
