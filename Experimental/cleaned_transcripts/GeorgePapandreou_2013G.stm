  this will not be a speech like any one i have ever given i will talk to you today about
 the failure of leadership in global politics
  and in our globalizing economy  and i won 't provide some
  solutions  but i will in the end urge you
 to rethink actually take risks and get involved in what i see as a global evolution
 of democracy failure of leadership what is the failure of leadership today
 and why is our democracy not working  well  i believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken
 you out of the process  so let me from my personal experiences give you
 an insight  so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going
 a blind alley  let 's start from the beginning let 's start from
 democracy  well if you go back to the ancient greeks  it was a revelation  a discovery that
 we had the potential together  to be masters of our
  to be able to examine to learn to imagine and then to design a better life  and democracy was the
 political innovation
 which protected this freedom because we were liberated from fear
 so that our minds in fact whether they be despots or dogmas could be the protagonists
  democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power whether it was of tyrants
 or of high priests 
 their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth  well i first began to understand this when i was fourteen years old 
 i used to to try to avoid homework 
 sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly you see then greece was
 under control of a very powerful
 establishment which was strangling the country  and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine greece to
 imagine a greece where freedom reigned and where maybe the people the citizens could actually rule
  i used to join him in many of the campaigns and you can see me here next to him i 'm the younger one there to the side 
 you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there 
 elections were coming 
 things were going well in the campaign the house was electric we really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in greece
  one night 
 military trucks drive up to our house 
 soldiers storm the door they find me up on the top terrace a
 sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun puts it to my head and says tell me where your father is or i will kill you 
  and was summarily
 taken to prison  well  we survived  but democracy did not seven brutal years of dictatorship
 which we spent in exile now
 today our democracies are again facing a moment of truth  let me tell you a story  sunday evening
  april two thousand and ten i 'm sitting with my counterparts in the european union i had just been elected prime minister  
 but i had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth
 that our deficit was not six percent as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections
 by the previous government but actually fifteen point six percent
  but the deficit was only
 the symptom of much deeper problems that greece was facing and
 i had been elected on a mandate  a mission actually to tackle these problems whether it was
 lack of transparency and accountability in governance or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to
 the powerful tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax
  evasion system 
 politics and media captured by special interests  
 but despite our electoral mandate  the markets mistrusted us 
 our borrowing costs were skyrocketing and we were facing possible default so i went to brussels on a mission
  to make the case
 for a united european response one that would calm the markets and give us the time
 to make the necessary reforms but time we didn 't get 
 picture yourselves around the table in brussels  
 negotiations are difficult the tensions are high progress is slow and then ten minutes to two a prime minister shouts out we have to
  these are important decisions let 's deliberate a little bit longer another prime minister comes in and says 
 no we have to have an agreement now 
 because in ten minutes the markets are opening up in japan and there will be havoc in the global economy 
 we quickly came to a decision in those ten minutes this time it was not the military but
 the markets that put a gun to our collective heads 
 what followed were the most difficult decisions in my life  painful to me  
 painful to my countrymen  imposing cuts austerity  often on those not to blame for the crisis 
 with these sacrifices greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided
  a collapse greece  yes triggered the euro crisis  and some people blame me for pulling the trigger  
 but i think today that most would agree
 that greece was only a symptom
 of much deeper
 structural problems in the eurozone  vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system  vulnerabilities of our democracies
  trapped by systems too big to fail or more accurately too big to control 
 our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws evade taxes  evade environmental or labor standards 
 our democracies are undermined
 by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth
 corruption  the speed of the markets or simply the fact that
 we sometimes fear an impending disaster have constrained our democracies and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential  your potential 
 in finding solutions 
  a preview of what is in store for us all i overly optimistically had hoped that this crisis
 was an opportunity for greece for europe for the world to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions  
 instead i had a very humbling experience 
 in brussels when we tried desperately again and again
 to find common solutions i realized that not one not one of us
 had ever dealt with a similar crisis  but worse we were trapped by our collective ignorance we were led
 by our fears and our fears led to a blind faith
 in the orthodoxy of austerity  instead of reaching out to the
 common or the collective wisdom in our
  societies  investing in it to find more creative solutions we reverted to political posturing  
 and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure
 didn 't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy
 to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure and of course
  a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt
 even more than austerity itself  but let me warn you this is not just about greece this could be the pattern
 that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex
  problems whether it 's climate change whether it 's migration whether it 's the financial system 
 that is abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential  falling victims to our fears our stereotypes our dogmas  
 taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around
  and doing so will only test the faith of our citizens of our peoples even more in the democratic process 
 it 's no wonder that many political leaders and i don 't exclude myself 
 have lost the trust
 of our people  when riot police have to protect parliaments  a scene which is
 increasingly common around the world then there 's something deeply wrong with our democracies
  that 's why i called for a referendum to have the greek people own and decide
 on the terms of the rescue package my european counterparts some of them at least said you can 't do this there will be
 havoc in the markets again i said we need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore
 confidence and trust amongst our people
 since leaving office i have had time to reflect  
 we have weathered the storm in greece and in europe  
 but we remain challenged 
 if politics is the power to imagine and use our potential well then  60 percent youth unemployment in greece 
 and in other countries certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion 
  far we 've thrown economics at the problem actually mostly austerity  
 and certainly we could have designed alternatives  a different strategy  a green stimulus for green jobs or
 mutualized debt eurobonds which would support countries in need from
 market pressures these would have been much more viable alternatives  yet i have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one
  of democracy  so let 's try something else  let 's see how we can bring people back to the process  let 's throw democracy at the problem 
 again the ancient greeks with all their shortcomings  believed in the wisdom of the crowd
 at their best moments in people we trust democracy could not
 work without the citizens
 deliberating debating taking on public responsibilities for public affairs  
 average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to
 decide on critical matters of the day  
 science  theater research philosophy games of the mind and the body they were daily exercises actually they were an education for
  for the potential for growing the potential of our citizens  and those who shunned politics well they were
 idiots you see in ancient greece in ancient athens that term originated there 
 idiot comes from the root idio oneself a
 person who is self centered secluded  excluded someone who doesn 't participate or even examine
  and participation took place in the agora the agora having two meanings both a marketplace
 and a place where there was political deliberation 
 you see markets and politics then were one unified accessible transparent because they gave power to the people they serve the demos  
 democracy  
  above markets was the direct rule of the people today we have globalized the markets
 but we have not globalized our democratic institutions  so our politicians are limited
 to local politics  while our citizens even though they see a great potential are prey
 to forces beyond their control so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora how do we democratize globalization
  and i 'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the united nations or the g20 i 'm talking about how do we secure the space the demos the platform of values 
 so that we can tap into
 all of  your potential well
 this is exactly where i think europe fits in europe despite its recent failures is the world 's most successful
  cross border peace experiment so let 's see if it can 't be
 an experiment
 in global democracy  a new kind of democracy  
 let 's see if we can 't design a european agora not simply for products and services but for our citizens where they can
 work together deliberate learn from each other exchange between art and cultures where they can
 come up
  with creative solutions  let 's imagine that european citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a european president 
 or citizen juries
 chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues 
 a european wide referendum where our citizens as the lawmakers vote on future treaties
 and here 's an idea 
 why not have the first truly european citizens by giving our immigrants not greek or german or
 swedish citizenship but
 a european citizenship  and make sure we
 actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in europe where our
  common identity is
 democracy where our education is
 through participation and where participation builds trust
 and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia europe of and by the people  a europe 
 an experiment in deepening and widening democracy
 beyond borders
 now some might accuse me of being naive  putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people  
 well after decades in politics  i am also a pragmatist 
 believe me i have been i am part of today 's political system  
 and i know things must change we
  must revive politics as the power to imagine reimagine and redesign
 for a better world  
 but i also know that this disruptive force of change won 't be driven by the politics of today  the revival of democratic politics
 will come from
  and i mean all of you  everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas whether it 's here in this room or just outside this room
 or online or locally where everybody lives  everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality 
 everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy  
 dogma rather than critical thinking  technocracy rather than
  everyone who stands up to the unchecked power whether it 's authoritarian leaders  plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens 
 or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few 
 it is in their interest
 that all of us are idiots  let 's not be thank you
  you seem to describe a political leadership that is kind of unprepared and a
 prisoner of the whims of the financial markets and that scene in brussels that you describe to me as a citizen is terrifying  
 help us understand how you felt after the decision it was not a good decision clearly but how do you feel after that not as the prime minister but as george
 papandreou well  obviously there were constraints which didn 't allow
 me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted and obviously i had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem  and that hurt that hurt because that first
  the younger generation and not only many of them are demonstrating outside  but i think this is one of our problems when we face these crises
  we have kept the potential the huge potential of our society out of this process and
 we are closing in on ourselves in politics and i think we need to to change that to really find new participatory ways
 using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology the minds that we have
  i think we can find solutions which are much better but we have to be open bg you seem to suggest that the way forward is more europe  and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most european countries it 's rather the other way
 more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the european construction 
  i think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game and
 the fundamental idea of europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders go beyond our conflicts and work together  and
 the the
 paradox is that because we have this blame game  we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together
  while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together
  more europe for me is not simply
 giving more power to brussels it is actually giving more power to the citizens of europe that is 
 really making europe a project of the people  so that i think would be a way to answer some of the
 fears that we have in our society bg george thank you for coming to ted
