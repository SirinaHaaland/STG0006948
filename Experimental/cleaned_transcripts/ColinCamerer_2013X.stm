  'm going to talk about the strategizing brain we 're
 going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line 
 so game theory is a a branch of originally applied mathematics
  used mostly in economics and political science a little bit in biology that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life
 and it predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in in cases where everyone 's actions affect everyone else  that 's a lot of things competition  cooperation bargaining
 and poker 
 here 's a simple game to get us started everyone chooses a number from zero to one hundred we 're going to compute the average of those numbers and whoever 's closest to two thirds of the average
 wins a fixed prize  so you want to be a little bit below the average number  but not too far below and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well 
 think about what you might pick 
 as you 're thinking  this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market right  you don 't want to sell too early  because you miss out on profits  but you don 't want to wait too late to when everyone else sells  triggering a crash you want to be a little bit ahead of the competition
  but not too far ahead  
 okay here 's two theories about how people might think about this and then we 'll see some data 
 some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way i 'm using my brain theory to see 
 a lot of people say i really don 't know what people are going to pick so i think the average will be fifty they 're not being really strategic at all and i 'll pick
  that 's a start 
 other people who are a little more sophisticated using more working memory say i think people will pick thirty three because they 're going to pick a response to fifty and so i 'll pick twenty two which is 
  doing one extra step of thinking two steps 
 that 's better 
 and of course in principle you could do three four or more but it starts to get very difficult  
 just like in language and other domains we know that it 's hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure  this is called a cognitive hierarchy theory by the way
  i 've worked on and a few other people and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected by
 lots of interesting variables and variant people as we 'll see in a minute 
 a very different theory a much more popular one and an older one due largely to john nash of a beautiful mind fame is what 's called
  so if you 've ever taken a game theory course at any level  you will have learned a little bit about this an equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do it is a very 
  useful concept  but behaviorally it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world 
  this experiment 's been done many many times some of the earliest ones were done in the ' 90s by me and rosemarie nagel and others  
 this is a beautiful data set of nine thousand people who wrote in to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest  the contest said send in your numbers
 and whoever is close to two thirds of the average will win a big prize  and as you can see there 's so much data here you can see the spikes very visibly there 's a spike at thirty three those are people doing one step there is another spike visible at
  and notice by the way that most people pick numbers right around there they don 't necessarily pick exactly thirty three and twenty two there 's something a little bit noisy around it  but you can see those spikes and they 're there there 's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis  
 because they 're picking zero or one  
 but they lose right  because picking a number that that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren 't doing equilibrium analysis as well  so they 're smart but poor
 where are these things happening in the brain 
 one study by coricelli and nagel gives a really sharp interesting answer  
 so they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fmri 
 and two conditions in some trials they 're told you 're playing another person who 's playing right now and we 're going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win 
 in the other trials they 're told you
  just choosing randomly  so what you see here is a subtraction
 of areas in which there 's more brain activity when you 're playing people compared to playing the computer and
 you see activity in some regions we 've seen today medial prefrontal cortex  dorsomedial however up here  ventromedial prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate an area that 's involved in lots of types of conflict resolution like if you 're playing simon says 
 and also the right and left temporoparietal
  and these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what 's called a theory of mind circuit or mentalizing circuit 
 that is it 's a circuit that 's used to imagine what other people might do  so these were some of the first studies to see this tied in to game theory 
 what happens with these one and two step types  so we classify people by what they picked  
 and then we look at the difference between playing humans versus playing computers which brain areas are differentially active on the top you see the one step players there 's almost no difference  the reason is they 're treating other people like a
  computer  and the brain is too the bottom players you see all the activity in dorsomedial pfc  
 so we know that those two step players are doing something differently 
 now if you were to step back and say what can we do with this information you might be able to look at brain activity and say this person 's going to be a good poker player or this person 's socially naive and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an
  i 'm saving you some brain activity because you don 't need to use your hair detector cells 
 you should use those cells to think carefully about this game  
 this is a bargaining game 
 two players who are being scanned using eeg electrodes are going to bargain over one to six dollars if they can do it in ten seconds they 're going to actually earn that money if ten seconds goes by and they haven 't made a deal
  that 's kind of a mistake together  the twist is that one player on the left is informed about how much on each trial there is they play lots of trials with different amounts each time 
 in this case they know there 's four dollars 
 the uninformed player doesn 't know but they know that the informed player knows  so the uninformed player 's challenge is to say is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there 's only one or two dollars available to split 
  in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal so there 's some tension here between trying to get the most money
 but trying to goad the other player into giving you more and the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars and they 're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets  and the 
  informed player 's going to get the rest  so this is like a management labor negotiation in which
  they want to maybe hold out for more money but the company might want to create the impression that there 's very little to split i 'm giving you the most that i can 
 first some behavior so a bunch of the subject pairs they play face to face we have some other data where they play across computers that 's an interesting difference as you might imagine  
 but a bunch of the face to face pairs agree to divide the money evenly every single time  
 boring  it 's just not interesting neurally  it 's good for
  they make a lot of money but we 're interested in can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don 't occur  
 so this is the other group of subjects who often disagree  
 so they have a chance of they bicker and disagree and end up with less money they might be eligible to be on real housewives the tv show 
 you see on the left when the amount to divide is one two or three dollars  they disagree about half the time  and when the amount is four five six they agree quite
  this turns out to be something that 's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at caltech and learn about 
 it 's a little too complicated to explain right now but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur your intuition might tell you that too  
 now i 'm going to show you the results from the eeg recording very complicated the right brain schematic is the uninformed person  and the left is the informed 
 remember that we we scanned both brains at the
  so we can ask about time synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously  just like if you wanted to study a conversation
 and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you 'd expect common activity in language regions when they 're actually kind of listening and communicating  
 so the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time  
 and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that 's active first in time  and the arrowhead goes to the region that 's active
 later  so in this case if you look carefully most of the arrows
  flow from right to left that is it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first  and then it
 's followed by activity in the informed brain and by the way these were trials where their deals were made 
 this is from the first two seconds  we haven 't finished analyzing this data  so we 're still peeking in  but the hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they 'll make a deal or not which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding
  litigation and ugly divorces and things like that those are all cases in which
 a lot of value is lost by delay and strikes 
 here 's the case where the disagreements occur you can see it looks different than the one before 
 there 's a lot more arrows 
 that means that the brains are synced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity and the arrows flow clearly from left to right  that is the informed brain seems to be deciding we 're probably not going to make a deal here
 and then later there 's activity in the uninformed brain 
 next i 'm going to introduce you to some relatives  they 're hairy  smelly fast and strong you might be thinking back to your last thanksgiving  
 maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you 
 charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago they 're still our closest genetic kin  we share ninety eight point eight percent of the genes we share more genes with them than zebras
  do with horses  
 and we 're also their closest cousin they have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas  
 so how humans and chimpanzees behave differently might tell us a lot about brain evolution  
 so this is an
 amazing memory test from nagoya japan primate research institute where they 've done a lot of this research this goes back quite a ways they 're interested in working
  then they disappear and they 're replaced by squares and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward let 's see how
 they can do it
  this is a young chimp  the young ones are better than the old ones just like humans 
 and they 're highly experienced so they 've done this thousands and thousands of time obviously there 's a big training effect as you can imagine 
 you can see they 're very blas and kind of effortless not only can they do it very well they do it in a sort of lazy way right who thinks you could beat the chimps
  next part of this study i 'm going to go quickly through
 is based on an idea of tetsuro matsuzawa he had a bold idea that what he called the cognitive trade off hypothesis we know chimps are faster and stronger they 're also very obsessed with status 
 his thought was  maybe they 've preserved brain activities and they practice them in development
 that are really really important to them to negotiate status and to win which is something like strategic thinking during competition  so we
  to check that out by having the chimps actually play a game
 by
 touching two touch screens the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers  they 're going to press left or right  one chimp is called a matcher they win if they press left left like a 
  seeker finding someone in hide and seek or right right the mismatcher wants to mismatch  they want to press the
  opposite screen of the chimp  and the rewards are apple cube rewards  
 so here 's how game theorists look at these data  this is a graph of the percentage of times the matcher picked right on the x axis and the percentage of times they predicted right by the mismatcher on the 
 so a point here is the behavior by a pair of players one trying to match one trying to mismatch  
 the ne square in the middle actually ne  ch and qre those are three different
  theories of nash equilibrium and others tells you what the theory predicts which is that they should match 50 50 
 because  if you play left too much for example i can exploit that if i 'm the mismatcher by then playing right  
 and as you can see the chimps each chimp is one triangle are circled around hovering around that prediction  
 now we move the payoffs we 're actually going to make the left left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher now they get three apple cubes game theoretically
  that should actually make the mismatcher 's behavior shift because what happens is the mismatcher will think oh this guy 's going to go for the big reward and so i 'm going to go to the right  make sure he doesn 't get it
  and as you can see their behavior moves up in the direction of this change
 in the nash equilibrium  
 finally we changed the payoffs one more time  now it 's four apple cubes  and their behavior again moves towards the nash equilibrium it 's sprinkled around but if you average the chimps out they 're really really close within 01 
 they 're actually closer than any species we 've observed what about humans you think you 're smarter than a chimpanzee
 here 's two human groups in green and blue  
 they 're closer to  50 50 they 're not responding to payoffs as closely and also if you study their learning in the game they aren 't as sensitive to previous rewards  the chimps are playing better than the humans better in the sense of adhering to game theory 
 and these are two different groups of humans from japan and africa they replicate
 quite nicely none of them are
  to where the chimps are
