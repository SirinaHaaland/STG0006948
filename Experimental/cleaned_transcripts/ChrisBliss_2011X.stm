  is one of my favorite writers for his storytelling but even more i think for the beauty and precision of his prose  
 and whether it 's the opening line from one hundred years of solitude or the fantastical stream of consciousness in autumn of the patriarch where the words rush by
  after page of unpunctuated imagery sweeping the reader along like some wild river twisting through a primal south american jungle  
 reading mrquez is a visceral experience  
 which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel
 when i realized that i was being swept along on this remarkable vivid journey in translation  now i was a comparative literature major in college
  which is like an english major only instead of being stuck studying chaucer for three months we got to read great literature in translation from around the world  
 and as great as these books were you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect  
 but not so with mrquez who once praised his translator 's versions as being better than his own
  which is an astonishing compliment 
 so when i heard that the translator
  gregory rabassa had written his own book on the subject  i couldn 't wait to read it it
 's called apropos of the italian adage that i lifted from his forward if this be treason 
 and it 's a charming read it 's highly recommended for anyone who 's interested in the translator 's art  
 but the reason that i mention it is that early on rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight
  act of communication is an act of translation 
 now maybe that 's been obvious to all of you for a long time but for me 
 as often as i 'd encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis i had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light  
 ever since i can remember thinking consciously about such things communication has been my central passion
  as a child  i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything
 and then to communicate it to everyone else so no ego problems it
 's funny my wife daisy whose family is littered with schizophrenics and i mean littered with them
  i already have a brother who thinks he 's god  i don 't need a husband who wants to be 
 anyway as i plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was it was that second part 
 being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge i was gaining where the futility of my quest really set in 
  recipient it had the opposite effect  
 interestingly when your opening line of communication is hey listen up because i 'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you 
 it 's amazing how quickly you 'll discover both ice and the firing squad 
 finally after about ten years of alienating friends and strangers alike  
 i finally got it
  new personal truth all my own that if i was going to
 ever communicate well with other people the ideas that i was gaining  i 'd better find a different way of going about it 
 and that 's when i discovered comedy 
 now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language 
 if i had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum i 'd say it falls somewhere between poetry
 and lies
 and i 'm not talking about all comedy here because clearly  there 's plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel what i want to talk 
  about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives
  the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world  
 because that 's what i take from the theme of this conference  gained in translation 
 that it 's about communication that doesn 't just produce greater understanding within the individual but leads to real change 
 which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of
  big on speaking to people 's self interest because we 're all wired for that it 's part of our survival package and that 's why it 's become so important for us and that 's why we 're always listening at that level 
 and also because that 's where in terms of our own self interest we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond 
 our responsibility to the rest of the world  
 now as to what i mean by the
  best comedy and satire i mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity  now if you think back on
 tina fey 's impersonations on saturday night live of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate sarah palin they were devastating 
 fey demonstrated far more effectively than
  any political pundit the candidate 's fundamental lack of seriousness cementing an impression that the majority of the american public still holds today 
 and the key detail of this is that fey 's scripts weren 't written by her and they weren 't written by the snl writers  
 they were lifted verbatim from palin 's own remarks 
 here was a palin impersonator quoting palin word
  now that 's honesty and integrity and it 's also why fey 's performances left such a lasting impression 
 on the other side of the political spectrum 
 the first time that i heard rush limbaugh refer to presidential hopeful john edwards as the breck girl
 i knew that he 'd made a direct hit now it 's not often that i 'm going to associate the words honesty and integrity with limbaugh  
 but it 's really hard to argue with that punchline the description perfectly captured edwards
  personal vanity  and guess what that ended up being the exact personality trait that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career  
 now the daily show with john stewart is by far the most 
 it 's by far the most
 well documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy  
 survey after survey from pew research to the annenberg center for public policy has found that daily show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major 
  network and cable news shows 
 now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate
  journalism
 than it does about the attentiveness of stewart 's viewers the larger point remains that stewart 's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts not because his intent is to inform it 's not 
 his intent is to be funny  
 it just so happens that stewart 's brand of funny doesn 't work unless the facts are true  
 and the result is great comedy that 's also an information delivery system
 that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention than the professional news media  
 now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people 's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection 
 a great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick 
  where you think it 's going over here and then all of a sudden you 're transported over here and there 's this mental delight that 's followed by the physical response of laughter  
 which not coincidentally  releases endorphins in the brain  
 and just like that you 've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses 
 this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic all of
 and the comedy comes along dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest race  religion politics sexuality
 only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin  we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows revealing a fresh and unexpected
  now let me give you an example from my act 
 i have some material about the so called radical gay agenda  which starts off by asking  how radical is the gay agenda  
 because from what i can tell the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military get married and start a family 
 three things i 've tried to avoid my
  have at it you radical bastards the field is yours 
 and that 's followed by these lines about gay adoption
 what is the problem with gay adoption why is this remotely controversial 
 if you have a baby and you think that baby 's gay you should be allowed to put it up for adoption 
 you have given birth to an abomination remove it from your household
  now by taking the biblical epithet abomination and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence a baby this joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate 
 and it leaves the audience with the opportunity through their laughter to question its validity  
  are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose
 of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline  bill hicks and if you don 't know his work you should really google him
 hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground  where finally the other kid says to him huh well my dad can beat up your
  that 's an entire childhood in three words 
 laughter not to mention what it reveals about the adult who 's speaking them 
 and one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it 's inherently viral people can 't wait to pass along that new great joke
 and this isn 't some new phenomenon of our wired world comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the internet  social media  even cable tv 
 back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty when comedian richard pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident 
 i was in los angeles the day after it happened and then i was in washington d c two days after that and i heard the
  exact same punchline on both coasts
 something about the ignited negro college fund  clearly it didn 't come out of a tonight show monologue 
 and my guess here and i have no research on this is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it you 'd find out that comedy is the second oldest viral profession 
  but it 's when you put all of these elements together
 when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that 's crafted from honesty and integrity  
 it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation  
 now i have a close friend joel pett who 's the editorial cartoonist for the lexington
  and he used to be the usa today monday morning guy  i was visiting with joel
 the weekend before the copenhagen conference on climate change opened in december of two thousand and nine  
 and joel was explaining to me that because usa today was one of america 's four papers of record it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference  
 which meant that if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon on
  the opening day of the conference it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decision makers 
 so we started talking about climate change
  and it turned out that joel and i were both bothered by the same thing  
 which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or wasn 't 
 which to both of us seems somewhat intentionally off point 
 because first of
  there 's this false premise
 that such a thing as complete science exists  
 now governor perry of my newly adopted state of texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops fated campaign
 for the republican presidential nomination  
 proclaiming over and over that the science wasn 't complete at the same time that two hundred and fifty out of two hundred and fifty four counties in the state of texas were on fire
 and perry 's policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pray for rain
  personally i was praying for four more fires so we could finally complete the damn science 
 but back in two thousand
  the question joel and i kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address 
  climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science 
  you 've got to love that idea 
 how about that how about we create a better world for nothing  
 not for god not for country not for profit just as a basic metric for global
  and this cartoon hit the bull 's eye  
 shortly after the conference was over joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the epa in washington whose wall it now hangs on 
 and not long after that he got another request for a copy from the head of the epa in california who used it as part of her presentation
 at an international conference on climate change in sacramento last year
  and it didn 't stop there 
 to date joel 's gotten requests from over forty environmental groups in the united states  canada and europe  and earlier this year he got a request from the green party 
  in australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world
  is a lot of punch for fourteen words 
 so my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny
  because you might just find the question that you 've been looking for thank you
