  and computer as technology

 i did a little research on it well this is what i found of course i hope i can memorize it the

 even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound
  violin or the piano i looked at that giant monster
 and said to myself i am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day 
 this is small and lightweight  i can play from standing sitting or walking
  's been so for more than four hundred years 
  stuff [ that ] easily looks dated  but i think it 's very personal and unique that although each violin looks pretty similar

 the entertainment  but
 actually the instrument itself isn 't very entertaining  i mean when i first got my violin and tried to play around on it it was
