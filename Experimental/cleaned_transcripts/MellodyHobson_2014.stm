  so it 's two thousand and six my friend harold ford calls me he 's running for
 in tennessee  
 and he says mellody  i desperately need some national press do you have any ideas so i had an idea i called a friend who was in new york at one of the most
  successful media companies in the world and she said why don 't we host an editorial board lunch for harold you come with him 
 harold and i arrive in new york we are in our best suits  we look like shiny new pennies  
 and we get to the receptionist and we say we 're here for the lunch 
 she motions for us to follow her  we walk through a series of corridors  and all of a sudden we find ourselves in a stark room
  at which point she looks at us and she says where are your uniforms 
 just as this happens my friend rushes in the blood drains from her face there are literally no words right  and i look at her and i say now 
 don 't you think we need more than one black person in the
 we still laugh about that story 
 and in many ways the moment caught me off guard  
 but deep deep down inside  i actually wasn 't surprised  and i wasn 't surprised because of something my mother taught me
 about thirty years before  you see my mother was
  i remember one day coming home from a birthday party where i was the only black kid invited  and instead of asking me the normal motherly questions like did you have fun or how was the cake 
 my mother looked at me and she said how did they treat you 
 i was seven i did not understand  i mean  why would anyone treat me differently  but she knew 
 and she looked me right in the eye and she said they will not always treat you well
  of those topics in america that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable 
 you bring it up at a dinner party or in a workplace environment it is literally the conversational equivalent of touching the third rail 
 there is shock  followed by a long silence 
 and even coming here today i told some friends and colleagues that i planned to talk about race  and they warned me they told me don 't do it that there 'd be
  huge risks in me talking about this topic that people might think i 'm a militant black woman and i would ruin my career  
 and i have to tell you i actually for a moment was a bit afraid then i realized 
 the first step to solving any problem is to not hide from it and the first step to any
  of action
 is awareness and so i decided to actually talk about race  
 and i decided that if i came here and shared with you some of my experiences that maybe we could all be a little less anxious
 and a little more bold in our conversations about race  now i know there are people out there who will say that the election of barack obama meant that
 it was the end of racial
 discrimination for all eternity right  
 but i work in the investment business and we have a saying the numbers do not lie  
 and here 
 there are significant quantifiable racial disparities that cannot be ignored in household wealth household income job opportunities healthcare 
 one example from corporate america  even though white men make up just thirty percent of the u s population they
  hold seventy percent of all corporate board seats
 of the fortune two hundred and fifty there are only seven ceos that are minorities  
 and of the thousands of publicly traded companies today thousands 
 only two are chaired by black women  and you 're looking at one of them the same one
  not too long ago was nearly mistaken for kitchen help 
 so that is a fact  now i have this thought experiment that i play with myself when i say  imagine if i walked you into a room
 and it was of a major corporation like exxonmobil  and every single person around the boardroom were black you would think that were weird 
 but if i walked you into a fortune five hundred company  and everyone
  the table is a white male  when will it be that we think that 's weird too  and i know how we got here 
 i know how we got here  you know there was
 institutionalized at one time legalized discrimination in our country there 's no question about it  but still as i
 grapple with this issue my mother 's question hangs in the air for
 for me how did they treat you  
 now i do not raise this issue to complain or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy i have succeeded in my life beyond my wildest expectations  
 and i have been treated well by people of all races more often than i have not 
 i tell the uniform story because it happened  i cite those statistics around corporate board diversity because they are real  and i stand here today talking about this issue of racial discrimination
 because i believe
  it threatens to rob another generation
 of all the opportunities that all of us want for all of our children no matter what their color or where they come from  
 and i think it also threatens to hold back businesses  
 you see  researchers have coined this term color blindness to describe a learned behavior where we pretend that we don 't notice race  
 if you happen to be surrounded
  by a bunch of people who look like you that 's purely accidental 
 now color blindness in my view doesn 't mean that there 's no racial discrimination and there 's fairness it doesn 't mean that at all it doesn 't ensure it 
 in my view color blindness is very dangerous because it means we 're ignoring the problem  
 there was a corporate study that
  instead of avoiding race the really smart corporations actually deal with it head on 
 they actually recognize that embracing diversity means recognizing all races  including the majority one 
 but i 'll be the first one to tell you  this subject matter can be hard awkward uncomfortable but that 's kind of the point 
 in the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes the one that black people don 't like to swim i 'm going to tell you how much i
  love to swim 
 i love to swim so much that as an adult i swim with a coach 
 and one day my coach had me do a drill where i had to swim to one end of a 25 meter pool without taking a breath  
 and every single time i failed i had to start over  and i failed a lot by the end i got it but when i got
  the pool i was exasperated and tired and annoyed and i said why are we doing breath holding exercises 
 and my coach looked me at me and he said mellody that was not a breath holding exercise 
 that drill was to make you comfortable being uncomfortable because that 's how most of us spend our days 
 if we can learn to deal with our discomfort and just relax into it we 'll have a better life
  so i think it 's time for us to be comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation about race 
 black white asian hispanic male female all of us 
 if we truly believe in equal rights and equal opportunity in america  i think we have to have real conversations about this issue  we cannot afford to be color blind  
 we have to be color brave
  we have to be willing as teachers and parents and entrepreneurs and scientists we have to be willing to have proactive conversations about race
 with honesty and understanding and courage not because it 's the right thing to do  but because it 's the smart thing to do 
 because our businesses and our products and our science our research all of that will be better with greater diversity 
 now my favorite example
  color bravery
 is a guy named john skipper he runs espn he 's a north carolina native quintessential southern gentleman white  
 he joined espn which already had a culture of inclusion and diversity but he took it up a notch he demanded that every open position
 have a diverse slate of candidates
  he says the senior people in the beginning bristled  and they would come to him and say do you want me to hire the minority 
 or do you want me to hire the best person for the job 
 and skipper says his answers were always 
 and by saying yes to diversity  i honestly believe that espn is the most valuable cable franchise in the world i think that 's a part of the secret sauce  
 now i can tell you in my own industry at ariel investments
  we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage 
 and that advantage can extend way beyond business  there 's a guy named scott page at the university of michigan he is the first person to develop a mathematical calculation for diversity  he says if you 're trying to solve a really hard problem really hard 
 that you should have a diverse group of people
  including those with diverse intellects the example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic when it was ravaging europe 
 they brought together all these scientists and they were stumped  and the beginnings of the cure to the disease came from the most unlikely source
 a dairy farmer who noticed that the 
 were not getting smallpox and the smallpox vaccination
  because of that dairy farmer  
 now  i 'm sure you 're sitting here and you 're saying  
 i don 't run a cable company  i don 't run an investment firm  
 i am not a dairy farmer what can i do  and i 'm telling you  you can be color brave  
 if you 're part of a hiring process or an admissions process  you can be color brave  
 if you are trying to solve a really hard problem  you can speak up and be color brave  
 now
 i know
  people will say  but that doesn 't add up to a lot but i 'm actually asking you to do something really simple observe your environment  
 at work at school at home 
 i 'm asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally  invite people into your life who don 't look like you
  don 't think like you  don 't act like you don 't come from where you come from and you might find that they will challenge your assumptions and make you grow as a person 
 you might get powerful new insights from these individuals 
 or like my husband who happens to be white you might learn that black people men women children  
 we use body lotion every single day  
 now 
 i also think that this is very important so that the next generation really understands
 that this progress will help them because they 're expecting us to be great role models now
 i told you my mother she was ruthlessly realistic she was an unbelievable role model 
 she was the kind of person who got to be the way she was because she was a single mom with six kids in chicago she was in the real estate business where she worked extraordinarily hard but oftentimes had a hard time making ends
 and that meant sometimes we got our phone disconnected or our lights turned off or we got evicted  
 when we got evicted sometimes we lived in these small apartments that she owned sometimes in only one or two rooms because they weren 't completed  and we would
 heat our bathwater on hot plates  but she never gave up hope ever
  and she never allowed us to give up hope either this brutal pragmatism that she had i mean i was four and she told me mommy is santa 
 laughter she was this brutal pragmatism 
 she taught me so many lessons but the most important lesson was that every single day she told me mellody  
 you can be anything
 and because of those
  i would wake up at the crack of dawn  and because of those words  i would
 love school more than anything  and because of those words when i was on a bus going to school  
 i dreamed the biggest dreams and it 's because of those words that i stand here right now full of passion 
 asking you to be brave for the kids who are dreaming those dreams today
 them to look at a ceo on television and say i can be like her or he looks like me 
 and i want them to know that anything is possible that they can achieve the highest level that they ever imagined 
 that they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom or they can lead any company  
 you see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave it 's woven into the fabric
 of america america when we have a challenge we take it head on we don 't shrink away from it 
 we take a stand we show courage  so right now what i 'm asking you to do  
 i 'm asking you to show courage  i 'm asking you to be bold  as business leaders i 'm asking you not to leave anything on the table as
  i 'm asking you not to leave any child behind  
 i 'm asking you not to be color blind but to be color brave  so that every child knows that their future matters and their dreams are possible
