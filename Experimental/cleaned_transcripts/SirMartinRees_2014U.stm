  ten years ago i wrote a book which i entitled our final century question mark my publishers cut out the question mark 
 the american publishers changed our title to our final
  americans like instant gratification and the reverse 
 and my theme was this our earth has existed for forty five million centuries but this one is special
 it 's the first where one species ours has the planet 's future in its hands  over nearly all of earth 's history  threats have come from nature
  asteroids and so forth but from now on the worst
 dangers come from us  
 and it 's now not just the nuclear threat 
 in our interconnected world network breakdowns can cascade globally  
 air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days  and social media can spread panic and rumor
 literally at the speed of light we fret too much about minor hazards
 improbable air crashes  carcinogens in food low radiation doses and so forth
 but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios 
 the worst have thankfully not yet happened indeed they probably won 't  
 but if an event is potentially devastating it 's worth paying a substantial
  premium to safeguard against it even if it 's unlikely just as we take out fire insurance on our house  
 and as science
 offers greater power and promise 
 the downside gets scarier too we get ever more vulnerable 
 within a few decades  millions will have the capability to misuse
 rapidly advancing biotech just as they misuse cybertech today  
 freeman dyson in a ted talk  foresaw that children will design and create new organisms
 just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets  
 well this may be on the science fiction fringe  but were even part of his scenario to come about our ecology and even our
  species would surely not survive long unscathed for instance there are some
 who think that it would be better for the planet for gaia if there were far fewer humans 
 what happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread
  by two thousand and fifty 
 and by then other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality  dumb robots going rogue  or a network that develops a mind of its own
 threatens us all well
 can we guard against such risks by regulation 
 we must surely try  but these enterprises are so competitive 
 so globalized  and so driven by commercial pressure that anything that can be done
 will be done somewhere  whatever the regulations say
 's like the drug laws we try to regulate but can 't 
 and the global village will have its village idiots  and they 'll have a global range 
 so
 as i said in my book we 'll have a bumpy ride through this century there may be setbacks to our society
 indeed a fifty percent chance of a severe setback but
  are there conceivable events that could be even worse  events that could snuff out all life  
 when a new particle accelerator came online some people anxiously asked could it destroy the earth or even worse  
 rip apart the fabric of space  
 well luckily  reassurance could be offered 
 i and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times
  already  via cosmic ray collisions  but scientists should surely be precautionary
 about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world
  biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens  
 and by the way  our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters
 depends
  on a philosophical and ethical question and it 's this  consider two scenarios scenario a
 wipes out
 ninety percent of humanity scenario b
 wipes out one hundred percent how much worse is b than a 
 some would say ten percent worse  the body count is ten percent higher
  claim that b is incomparably worse as an astronomer i can 't believe that humans are the end of the story it
 is five billion years before the sun flares up and the universe may go on forever so post human evolution 
 here on earth and far beyond could be as prolonged as
 darwinian process that 's led to us and even more wonderful 
 and indeed future evolution will happen much faster on a technological timescale not a natural selection timescale  so we surely 
 in view of those immense stakes shouldn 't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential 
 some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction but others may be
  's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable 
 and in fact that 's why we at cambridge university are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks 
 it seems it 's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters  and we need all the help we can get from others 
 because we are stewards of a precious
  pale blue dot in a vast cosmos a planet with fifty million centuries ahead of it and so let 's not jeopardize that future and i 'd
 like to finish with a quote
 from a great scientist called peter medawar i quote the bells that toll for mankind
 are like the bells of alpine cattle 
 they are attached to our own necks  and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound thank you very much
