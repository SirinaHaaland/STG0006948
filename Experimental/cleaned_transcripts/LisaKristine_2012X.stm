  i 'm one hundred and fifty feet
 down an illegal mine shaft in ghana
  the air is thick with heat and dust  and it 's hard to breathe
  i can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness  but i can 't see much else 
 i hear voices talking but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing  
 and stone being broken with primitive tools 
 like the others  i wear a flickering cheap flashlight
 tied to my head with this elastic  tattered band
  i can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three foot square hole
 dropping hundreds of feet into the earth 
 when my hand slips i suddenly remember a miner i had met days before who had lost his grip
 and fell countless feet
 down that shaft as i stand talking to you today
 these men are still deep in that hole  risking their lives without payment or compensation  and often dying 
 i got to climb out of that hole  and i got to go home  
 but they likely never will because they 're trapped
 in slavery
  for the last twenty eight years i 've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than seventy countries on six continents  and in two thousand and nine i had the great honor
 of being the sole exhibitor at the vancouver peace summit  amongst all the astonishing people i met there  
 i met a supporter of free the slaves an ngo dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery  
 we started talking about slavery and really
  really i started learning about slavery  for i had certainly known it existed in the world  but not to such a degree  
 after we finished talking i felt so horrible
 and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime  and i
 i thought if i don 't know how many other people don 't know 
 it started burning a hole in my stomach so within weeks  
 i flew down to los angeles to meet with the director of free the slaves and offer them my help  
 thus began my journey into modern day slavery  
 oddly i had been to many of these places before some i even considered like my
  but this time  i would see the skeletons hidden in the closet a conservative estimate tells us there are more than 
 million people enslaved in the world today that 's double the amount of people taken from africa during the entire
 trans atlantic slave trade 
 a hundred and fifty years ago an
  agricultural slave
 cost about three times the annual salary of an american worker 
 that equates to about $ fifty thousand in today 's money  
 yet today  entire families can be enslaved for generations
 over a debt as small as $ eighteen  astonishingly slavery generates profits of more than $ thirteen
  have been tricked by false promises
 of a good education a better job 
 only to find that they 're forced to work without pay under the threat of violence  and they cannot walk away 
 today 's slavery is about commerce so the goods that enslaved people produce have value  but the people producing them
 are disposable slavery exists
 everywhere nearly in the world  and yet it is illegal
 everywhere in the world 
 in india and nepal i was introduced to the brick kilns 
 this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient egypt or dante 's inferno
  inferno  enveloped in temperatures
 of one hundred and thirty degrees men women children 
 entire families in fact were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust  
 while mechanically stacking bricks on their head up to eighteen at a time  and carrying them from the scorching kilns
 to trucks hundreds of yards away  deadened by monotony
  and exhaustion  they work silently  doing this task over and over
 for sixteen or seventeen hours a day 
 there were no breaks for food no water breaks  and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential 
 pervasive was the heat and the dust
 that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working 
 every twenty minutes i 'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it 
 and as i sat there i thought my camera is getting far better treatment
 than these people back in the
  i wanted to cry  
 but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said lisa don 't do that just don 't do that here and he very clearly explained to me
 that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this not just for me  but for them  
 i couldn 't offer them any direct help  i couldn 't give them money  
  i wasn 't a citizen of that country  i could get them in a worse
 situation than they were already in 
 i 'd have to rely on free the slaves to work within the system for their liberation and i trusted
 that they would as for me  i 'd have to wait until i got home to really feel
 my heartbreak in the himalayas i found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain
  terrain
 to trucks waiting at roads below  
 the big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them  and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these
 handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth it 's difficult to witness something so
  how can we affect something so insidious  yet so pervasive  
 some don 't even know they 're enslaved people working sixteen seventeen hours a day without any pay  
 because this has been the case all their lives  they have nothing
 to compare it to 
 when these villagers claimed their freedom  the slaveholders burned down all of their houses
  i mean these people had nothing  and they were so petrified they wanted to give up  
 but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere  and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own so that now they do the same back breaking work  
 but they do it for themselves  and they get paid for it  and they do it in freedom
  sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery  and because of this worldwide awareness i was warned that it would be
 difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry 
 in kathmandu i was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves  
 they ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this
 dirty  dimly fluorescent lit
 basement 
 this wasn 't a brothel per se it was more like a restaurant  cabin restaurants as they 're known in the trade are venues for forced prostitution  
 each has small private rooms where the slaves women  along with young girls and boys some as young as seven years old 
 are forced to entertain the clients encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol
  each cubicle is dark and dingy  
 identified with a painted number on the wall  and partitioned by plywood and a curtain  
 the workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers  
 standing in the near darkness  i remember
  and in that instant i could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell 
 i had only one way out the stairs from where i 'd come in 
 there were no back doors  there were no windows large enough to climb through these people
 have no escape at all and as we take in such a difficult
  it 's important to note
 that slavery including sex trafficking occurs in our own backyard as well  
 tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture in restaurants in domestic servitude  and the list can go on 
 recently the new york times reported that between one hundred thousand
 and three hundred thousand american children are sold into sex slavery every year
 it 's all around us we just don 't see it 
 the textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor  
 i visited villages in india where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade  
 this is a family portrait  the dyed black hands are the
  father  while the blue and red hands are his sons  
 they mix dye in these big barrels  and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows  but the dye
 is toxic 
 my interpreter told me their stories we have no freedom
  we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing 
 it 's estimated that more than four thousand children
 are enslaved on lake volta  the largest man made lake in the world 
 when we first arrived  i went to have a quick look  i saw what seemed to be a
  family fishing on a boat two older brothers some younger kids  makes sense right  
 wrong they were all enslaved children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished  
 and they 're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake even though they do not know how to swim 
 this young child is eight years old
 he was trembling when our boat approached frightened it would run over his tiny canoe  he was petrified he would be knocked in the water 
 the skeletal tree limbs submerged in lake volta
 often catch the fishing nets  and weary frightened children are thrown into the water
 to untether the lines many of them drown for
  as long as he can recall  he 's been forced to work on the lake  
 terrified of his master he will not run away  and since he 's been treated with cruelty all his life  
 he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages  
 i met these boys at five in the morning when they were hauling in the last of their nets  but they had been working since one
 a m in the cold  windy night  
 and it 's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they 're full of fish  
 i want to introduce you to kofi  
 kofi was rescued from a fishing village  i met him at a shelter where free the slaves
 rehabilitates victims of slavery
 here he 's seen taking a bath at the well pouring big buckets of water over his head 
 and the wonderful news is as you and i are sitting here talking today  kofi has been reunited with his family 
 and what 's even better his family has been given tools to make a living
 and to keep their children
  kofi is the embodiment
 of possibility who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference
 in his life  
 driving down a road in ghana with partners of free the slaves 
 a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window 
 he told us to follow him
 down a dirt road into the jungle at the end
  of the road he urged us out of the car and told the driver to quickly leave  
 then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath and said this is the path this is the path go 
 as we started down the path  we pushed aside the vines blocking the way  
 and after about an hour of walking in found that the trail had become flooded
 by recent rains
  so i hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest  
 after another two hours of hiking  the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing  
 and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field 
 and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring
 many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold  wading in water poisoned
 by mercury mercury is used in the extraction process these miners
 are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of ghana
  when they came out of the shaft they were soaking wet from their own sweat  
 i remember looking into their tired  bloodshot eyes for many of them had been underground for 
 hours 
 the shafts are up to three hundred feet deep  
 and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the
 at first glance  the pounding site seems full of powerful men  
 but when we look closer we see some less fortunate
 working on the fringes  and children too all of them are victim to injury  illness
 and violence in fact it 's very likely
  that this muscular person will end up like this one here racked with tuberculosis
 and mercury poisoning in just a few years 
 this is manuru when his father died his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines when his
  manuru inherited his uncle 's debt which further forced him
 into being enslaved in the mines  when i met him he had been working in the mines for fourteen years  
 and the leg injury that you see here
 is actually from a mining accident one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated on top of that
  yet he 's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft even still he has a dream
 that he will become free
 and become educated with the help of local activists like free the slaves 
 and it 's this sort of determination in the face of unimaginable odds 
 that fills me
 with complete awe
 i want to shine a light on slavery  
 when i was working in the field  i brought lots of candles with me 
 and with the help of my interpreter  
 i imparted to the people i was photographing that i wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight 
 so when it was safe for them and safe for me  i made
  these images  
 they knew their image would be seen by you out in the world  
 i wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them  
 and that we will do whatever we can
 to help make a difference in their lives  i truly believe  if we can see one another as fellow human beings
  then it becomes very difficult to tolerate
 atrocities
 like slavery  
 these images are not of issues they are of people real people like you and me all deserving of the same rights  dignity and respect in their lives  
 there is not a day that goes by that i don 't think of these many
  beautiful  mistreated
 people i 've had the tremendous
 honor of meeting  
 i hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them people like you 
 and i hope that force will ignite a fire  and that fire will shine a light on slavery  
 for without that light
  the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows  thank you very much
