  like many of you i 'm one of the lucky people i was born to a family where education was pervasive 
 i 'm a third generation phd a daughter of two academics in my childhood i played around in my father 's university lab 
 so it was taken for granted that i attend some
  of the best universities which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity  
 unfortunately  most of the people in the world are not so lucky  
 in some parts of the world for example south africa education is just not readily accessible 
 in south africa  the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white
  and as a consequence today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education 
 that scarcity led to a crisis in january of this year at the university of johannesburg 
 there were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration thousands of people lined up outside the gate
 in a line a mile long
  hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions 
 when the gates opened there was a stampede 
 and twenty people were injured and one woman died  she was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life 
 but even in parts of the world like the united states where education is available it might not be within reach 
 there has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care 
 what might not be quite as obvious
  to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate for a total of five hundred and fifty nine percent since 
 this makes education
 unaffordable for many people 
 finally even for those who do manage to get the higher education  the doors of opportunity might not open only a little over half of recent college
  graduates in the united states who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education 
 this of course is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions 
 but for many others they do not get the value for their time and their effort  
 tom friedman in his recent new york times article captured
  in the way that no one else could the spirit behind our effort  
 he said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary  
 i 've talked about what 's desperately necessary  let 's talk about what 's suddenly possible 
 what 's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big stanford classes each of which had an enrollment of one hundred thousand people or more 
 so to understand this let 's look at one of those classes the machine learning class offered by my colleague and
  cofounder andrew ng  
 andrew teaches one of the bigger stanford classes it 's a machine learning class and it has four hundred people enrolled every time it 's offered 
 when andrew taught the machine learning class to the general public  it had one hundred thousand people registered  
 so to put that number in perspective for andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a stanford
  he would have to do that for two hundred and fifty years of course he 'd get really bored 
 so having seen the impact of this andrew and i decided that we needed to really try and scale this up to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could  
 so we formed coursera  whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free
  currently have forty three courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like
  student of sociology to develop the quality of mind rg hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine nick parlante for each pixel in the image  set the red to zero paul offit 
 vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus dan jurafsky does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose well
 that sounds funny
  it turns out maybe not surprisingly that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free  
 since we opened the website in february  we now have six hundred and forty thousand students from one hundred and ninety countries  we have one point five million enrollments six million quizzes in the fifteen classes that have launched so far have been submitted
  and fourteen million videos have been viewed  
 but it 's not just about the numbers  it 's also about the people  whether it 's akash who comes from a small town in india and would never have access in this case to a stanford quality course and would never be able to afford it 
 or jenny  who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master 's degree 
 or
 ryan who can 't go to school because his immune deficient daughter can 't be risked to have germs come into the house so he couldn 't leave the house  
 i 'm really glad to say recently we 've been in correspondence with ryan that this story had a happy ending baby shannon you can see her on the left is doing much better now and ryan got a job by taking some of our courses 
 so what made these courses so different after
  all online course content has been available for a while 
 what made it different was that this was real course experience  it started on a given day  and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments  
 and these would be real homework assignments for a real grade with a real deadline  you can see the deadlines and the usage graph these are the spikes
 showing that
  procrastination is global phenomenon 
 at the end of the course the students got a certificate 
 they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job and we know many students who did 
 some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit so these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time
  and effort  let 's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses  the first
 component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format you can break away from for example the monolithic one hour lecture 
 you can break up the material
 for example into these short modular units of eight to twelve minutes  each of which represents a coherent concept 
 students can traverse this material in different ways depending on their background their skills or their interests 
 so for example  some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have 
 other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue
  so this format allows us to break away from 
  model of education and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum 
 of course we all know as educators that students don 't learn by sitting and passively watching videos 
 perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material
  order to really understand it 
 there 's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this this one that appeared in science last year for example  demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice where students are just 
  supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions  
  for example even our videos are not just videos every few minutes the video pauses and the students get asked a question sp these four things prospect
 theory hyperbolic discounting  status quo bias  base rate bias  they 're all well documented so they 're all well documented deviations from rational behavior dk 
 so here the video pauses and the student types in the answer into the box
  obviously they weren 't paying attention 
 laughter so they get to try again  
 and this time they got it right  there 's an optional explanation if they want and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture 
 this is a kind of simple question that i as an instructor might ask in class  but when i ask
 that kind of a question in class  eighty percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing i said fifteen percent are zoned out on facebook  
 and then there 's the smarty pants in the front row
 who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it 
 and i as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer  
 and so the lecture moves on before really most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked here 
 every single student has to engage with the material and
 of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story one needs to build in much more
  meaningful practice questions  and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions now how do you grade the work of one hundred thousand students if you do not have ten thousand tas 
 the answer is you need to use technology to do it for you now fortunately technology has come a long way  and we can now grade a range of interesting
  types of homework 
 in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video we can also grade math  mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations  
 we can grade models whether it 's
 financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class
 and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments let me show you one that 's actually pretty simple but fairly visual 
 this is from stanford 's computer science one hundred and one class and the students are supposed to
 color correct that blurry red image they 're typing their program into the browser  and you can see they didn 't get it quite right  lady liberty is still seasick  
 and so the student tries again  and now they got it right  and they 're told that and they can move on to the next assignment 
 this ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you 're right or wrong is really essential to student learning 
 now of course we cannot yet grade the
  range of work that one needs for all courses  
 specifically what 's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities the social sciences business and others  
 so we tried to convince for example some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy that didn 't go over really well  
 so we had to come up with a different solution and the solution we ended up using is peer grading
 it turns out that previous studies show like this one by saddler and good that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades
 it was tried only in small classes but there it showed for example  that 
  on the y axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher assigned grade on the x axis what
 's even more surprising is that self grades where the students grade their own work critically so long as you incentivize them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score
 are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades  and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale and is also a useful learning strategy for the students because they actually learn from the experience  
 so we now have
 the largest peer grading pipeline ever devised where tens of thousands
 of students are grading each other 's work and quite successfully
  have to say  
 but this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems 
 around each one of our courses a community of students had formed 
 a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor what you see here is a self generated map from students in our princeton
  they have put themselves on a world map and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort 
 students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways  
 first of all there was a question and answer forum where students would pose questions  and other students would answer those questions  
 and the really amazing thing is because there were so many students it means that even if a student posed a question at three o 'clock in the morning somewhere around the world there would be somebody who was awake
 and working on the same problem  and so in many of our courses the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was twenty two minutes  
 which is not a level of service i have ever offered to my stanford students 
 and you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community they got to interact with each other in many ways
  that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom students also 
  any kind of intervention from us into small study groups 
 some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets this is the san francisco study group but there were ones all over
  others were virtual study groups  sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines  and on the bottom left there you see our multicultural
 universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures there
 are some tremendous opportunities
 to be had from this kind of framework  the first is that it
 has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning
  because the data that we can collect here is unique  you can collect every click 
 every homework submission every forum post from tens of thousands of students so you can turn the study of human learning from the 
  mode to the  data driven mode a transformation that for example has
  you can use these data to understand fundamental questions like what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not 
 and in the context of particular courses you can ask questions like what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them  
 so here 's an example of that also from andrew 's machine learning class 
 this is a distribution of wrong answers to one of andrew 's assignments the answers happen to be pairs of numbers so you can draw them on this
 each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer  
 the big cross at the top left is where two thousand students gave the exact same wrong answer  
 now if two students in a class of one hundred give the same wrong answer  you would never notice  but when two thousand students give the same wrong answer it 's kind of hard to miss 
 so andrew and his students went in looked at some of those assignments
  understood the root cause of the misconception  and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket 
 which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively 
 so this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large
  numbers  
 personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30 year old problem 
 educational researcher benjamin bloom 
 posed what 's called the two sigma problem  which he observed by studying three populations  
 the first is the population that studied in a lecture based classroom  the second is a
  population of students that studied using a standard lecture based classroom  but with a mastery based approach  so the students couldn 't move on to the next topic before
 demonstrating mastery of the previous one  and finally  there was a population of students that were taught in a one on one instruction using a tutor 
 the mastery based population was a full standard deviation or sigma in achievement scores better than the
  and the individual tutoring gives you two sigma improvement in performance 
 to understand what that means  let 's look at the lecture based classroom and let 's pick the median performance as a threshold  so in a lecture based class half the students are above that level and half are below 
 in the individual tutoring instruction ninety eight percent of the students are going to be above that threshold  
 imagine if we could teach so that
 ninety eight percent of our students would be above average  
 hence the two sigma problem  
 because we cannot afford as a society to provide every student with an individual human tutor  
 but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone  so the question is how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph from the blue curve to the right side with the green curve
  mastery is easy to achieve using a computer because a computer doesn 't get tired of showing you the same video five times  
 and it doesn 't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times we 've seen that in many of the examples that i 've shown you 
 and even personalization is something that we 're starting to see the beginnings of whether it 's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we 've shown you 
 so the goal here
  is to try and push  and see how far we can get towards the green curve  so  if this is
 so great are universities now obsolete 
 well mark twain certainly thought so he said that college is a place where a professor 's lecture notes go straight to the students ' lecture notes  without passing through the brains of either 
  i beg to differ with mark twain though 
 i think what he was complaining about is not is not universities but rather the lecture based format that so many universities spend so much time on 
 so let 's go back even further to plutarch who said that the mind is not a vessel that needs filling but wood that needs igniting 
 and maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our
  minds with content by lecturing at them and more time igniting their creativity their imagination and their problem solving skills by actually talking with them  
 so how do we do that we do that by doing active learning in the classroom  
 so there 's been many studies including this one that show that if you use active learning  interacting with your students in the classroom  performance improves on every single
  on attendance on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test you can see for example that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment  
 so maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities  
 so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free  what would that do 
 three things  first it would establish education
  fundamental human right where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation
 could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves their families and their communities 
 second it would enable lifelong learning it 's a shame that for so many people learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college by having this amazing content be available we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted whether
 's just to expand our minds or it 's to change our lives  
 and finally this would enable a wave of innovation  because amazing talent can be found anywhere maybe the next albert einstein or the next steve jobs
  is living somewhere in a remote village in africa  and if we could offer that person an education they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us
