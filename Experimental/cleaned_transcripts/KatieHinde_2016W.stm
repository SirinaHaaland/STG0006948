  have you ever heard the one about how breastfeeding is free 
 yeah it 's pretty funny  because it 's only free if we don 't value women 's time
  and energy 
 any mother can tell you how much time and energy it takes to liquify her body to literally dissolve herself 
 as she feeds this precious little cannibal 
 milk is why mammals suck at arizona state university in the comparative
  i decode mothers ' milk composition to understand its complexity
 and how it influences infant development  the most important thing that i 've learned
 is that we do not do enough
 to support mothers and babies  and when we fail mothers and babies we fail everyone who loves mothers and
  the fathers the partners the grandparents the aunties the friends and kin
 that make our human social networks 
 it 's time that we abandon simple solutions and simple slogans and grapple with the nuance 
 i was very fortunate to run smack dab into that nuance very early during my first interview with a journalist
 when she asked me how long should a mother breastfeed her baby
 and it was that word should that brought me up
 short  because i will never tell a woman what she should do with her body 
 babies survive and thrive because their mother 's milk is food medicine and signal 
  mother 's milk is a complete diet that provides all the building blocks for their bodies that shapes their brain and fuels all of their activity mother
 's milk also feeds the microbes that are colonizing the infant 's intestinal tract 
 mothers aren 't just eating for two they 're eating for two to the trillions  
 milk provides immunofactors that help fight pathogens
 and mother 's milk provides hormones that signal to
  the infant 's body  
 but in recent decades  we have come to take milk for granted  we stopped seeing something in plain sight  
 we began to think of milk as standardized homogenized pasteurized  packaged powdered flavored and formulated
  we abandoned the milk of human kindness and turned our priorities elsewhere 
 at the national institutes of
 in washington dc
 is the national library of medicine 
 which contains twenty five million articles the brain trust of life science and biomedical research
 we can use keywords to search that database  and when we do that we discover nearly a million articles about pregnancy  
 but far fewer about breast milk and lactation
  we zoom in on the number of articles just investigating breast milk  
 we see that we know much more about coffee  wine and tomatoes 
 we know over twice as much about erectile dysfunction 
 i 'm not saying we shouldn 't know about those things i 'm a scientist i think we should know about everything
  we know so much less 
 about breast milk the first fluid a young mammal is adapted to consume should make us angry  
 globally nine out of ten women will have at least one child in her lifetime 
 that means that nearly one hundred and thirty million babies are born each year these mothers and babies deserve our best science 
 recent research has shown that milk
  doesn 't just grow the body it fuels behavior and shapes 
 in two thousand and fifteen researchers discovered that the mixture of breast milk and baby saliva specifically baby saliva
 causes a chemical reaction that produces hydrogen peroxide
 that can kill staph and salmonella and from humans and other mammal species we 're starting to understand that the biological
  recipe of milk can be different when produced for sons or daughters 
 when we reach for donor milk in the neonatal intensive care unit or formula on the store shelf it 's nearly 
 we aren 't thinking about how sons and daughters may grow at different rates or different ways  and that milk may be a part of that 
 mothers have gotten the message and the vast
  majority of mothers intend to breastfeed but many do not reach their breastfeeding goals 
 that is not their failure it 's ours  
 increasingly common medical conditions like obesity  endocrine disorders c section and preterm births all can disrupt the underlying biology of lactation 
 and many women do not have knowledgeable clinical support
 twenty five years ago the world health organization and unicef established criteria for hospitals to be considered baby friendly
 that provide the optimal level of support for mother infant bonding and infant feeding 
 today only one in five babies in the united states is born in a baby friendly hospital 
 this is a problem because mothers can grapple with many
  problems in the minutes  hours  days and weeks of lactation 
 they can have struggles with establishing latch with pain with milk letdown and perceptions of milk supply 
 these mothers deserve knowledgeable clinical staff
 that understand these processes mothers will call me as they 're grappling with these struggles
  with wobbly voices 
 it 's not working this is what i 'm supposed to naturally be able to do why is it not working 
 and just because something is evolutionarily ancient
 doesn 't mean that it 's easy or that we 're instantly good at it you know what else is evolutionarily ancient
  nobody expects us to start out being good at it 
 clinicians best deliver quality equitable care when they have continuing education
 about how to best support lactation and breastfeeding  and in order to have that continuing education we need to anchor it
  in both the life sciences and the social sciences because we need to recognize that too often
 historical traumas
 and implicit biases sit in the space between a new mother and her clinician the body is political 
 if our breastfeeding support is not intersectional it 's not good
  and for moms who have to return for work because countries like the united states do not provide paid parental leave 
 they can have to go back in as short as just a few days after giving birth 
 how do we optimize mother and infant health
 just by messaging about breast milk to moms without providing the institutional support that facilitates
  to support breastfeeding the answer is  we can 't 
 i 'm talking to you  legislators and the voters who elect them 
 i 'm talking to you job creators and collective bargaining units and workers  and shareholders 
 we all have a stake in the public health of our community  and we all have a role to play in achieving it 
 breast milk is a part of
  improving human health 
 in the nicu when infants are born early or sick or injured milk or bioactive constituents in milk can be critically important 
 environments or ecologies or communities where there 's high risk of infectious disease 
 breast milk can be incredibly protective  where there are emergencies like storms
  when the electricity goes out when safe water is not available breast milk can keep babies fed and hydrated  
 and in the context of humanitarian crises like syrian mothers fleeing war zones  the smallest drops
 can buffer babies from the biggest global challenges  but understanding breast milk
 is not just about messaging to mothers and policy makers it 's also about
 understanding what is important in breast milk so that we can deliver
 better formulas to moms who cannot or do not breastfeed for whatever reason  
 we can all do a better job of supporting the diversity of moms raising their babies in a diversity of ways  
 as women around the world struggle to achieve
  and economic equality  we must reimagine motherhood as not the central  
 core aspect of womanhood but one of the many potential facets of what makes women awesome  it 's time
