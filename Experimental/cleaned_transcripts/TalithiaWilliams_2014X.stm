  as a kid i always loved
 information that i could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers  i remember  growing up i 'd be frustrated at how my own parents would lie to
  if i 've told you once i 've told you a thousand times no dad you 've only told me seventeen times
 and twice it wasn 't my fault 
 i think that is one of the reasons i got a ph d in statistics i always wanted to know what are people trying to hide with numbers
 as a statistician  i want people to show me the data
 so i can decide for myself
 donald and i were pregnant with our third child and we were at about forty one and a half weeks  what some of you may refer to as being overdue  
 statisticians we call that being within the ninety five percent confidence interval 
 laughter and at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby and this is just routine it tests whether or not the baby
  is feeling any type of undue stress 
 and you are rarely if ever seen by your actual doctor just whoever happens to be working at the hospital that day  
 so we go in for a stress test and after twenty minutes the doctor comes out and he says 
 your baby is under stress  we need to induce you
  show me the data 
 so then he proceeds to tell us the baby 's heart rate trace went from eighteen minutes the baby 's heart rate was in the normal zone and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be my heart rate zone
 and i said is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate i was moving around a little bit it 's hard to lay still on your back
 forty one weeks pregnant for twenty minutes  maybe it was shifting around he said well we don 't want to take any chances 
 i said okay  i said  what if i was at thirty six weeks with this same data would your decision be to induce 
 well no i would
 wait until you were at least  thirty eight weeks but you are almost forty two there is no reason to leave that baby inside let 's get you a room
 why don 't we just do it again we can collect more data i can try to be really still for twenty minutes  we can average the two and see what
 that means
  just don 't want you to have a miscarriage 
 that makes three of us 
 and then he says your chances of having a miscarriage double
 when you go past your due date let 's get you a room wow  so now as a statistician
  where are we here with this miscarriage thing and he goes  not quite but it doubles  and we really just want what 's best for the baby
  pregnant women how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date and then he looks at me
 and looks at donald and he goes about one in one thousand i said okay  so of those one thousand women how many are going
  so you are telling me that my chances go from a 
  chance to a 
 okay  so at this point the data is not convincing us that we need to be induced  and so then we proceed to have a conversation about how inductions lead to a higher rate of cesarean sections and if at all possible we 'd like
  to avoid that and then i said and i really don 't think my due date is accurate and so
 this really stunned him
 and he looked sort of puzzled and i said  you may not know this but pregnancy due dates are calculated assuming that you have a standard 28 day cycle and my cycle ranges
  and i have been collecting the data to prove it 
 laughter and so
 we ended up leaving the hospital that day without being induced we actually had to sign a waiver to walk out of the hospital 
 and i 'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors because even with our first child we were induced at
  fluid was low i 'm not 
  intervention  but why were confident to leave that day  well we had data that told a different story  we had been collecting data
 for six years  i had this temperature data and it told a different story in fact
  a story you want to tell at your kid 's wedding
 reception i remember like it was yesterday 
 my temperature was a sizzling ninety seven point eight degrees as i stared into your father 's
  confident to leave because we had been collecting data now what does that data look like here 's a standard chart
 of a woman 's waking body temperature
 during the course of a cycle so from the beginning of the menstrual cycle till the beginning of the next you
 'll see that the temperature is not random
 clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her
  cycle so what 's happening here what is that data telling you 
 well ladies 
 at the beginning of our cycle the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature 
 and at ovulation your body releases an egg
 and progesterone takes over
  anticipation of housing this new little fertilized egg  so why this temperature jump 
 well think about when a bird sits on her eggs  why is she sitting on them 
 she wants to keep them warm protect them and keep them warm  ladies this is exactly what our bodies do every month they heat up in anticipation of keeping a new little life warm  
 and
 if nothing
  happens if you are not pregnant then estrogen takes back over and that cycle starts all over again  
 but if you do get pregnant  sometimes you actually see another shift in your temperatures and it stays elevated for those whole nine months that 's why you see those pregnant women just sweating and hot
  because their temperatures are high 
 here 's a chart that we had about three or four years ago we were
  really very excited about this chart you 'll see the low temperature level and then a shift
 and for about five days that 's about the time it takes for the egg to travel down the fallopian tube and implant  
 and then you see those temperatures start to go up a little bit  and in fact  we had a second temperature shift  confirmed
 with a pregnancy test that were indeed pregnant with our first child very
  exciting until a couple of days later i saw some spotting
 and then i noticed heavy blood flow  and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage
 had i not been taking my temperature i really would have just thought my period was late that month  but we actually had data to show that we had miscarried this baby
  even though this data revealed a really unfortunate event in our lives it was information that we could then take to our doctor so if there was a fertility issue or some problem  i had data to show look  we 
  got pregnant our temperature shifted  we somehow lost this baby  what is it that we can do to help prevent this problem 
  tell us a lot of things for instance did you know that taking your temperature can tell you a lot about the condition of your thyroid 
 so your thyroid works a lot like the thermostat in your house  
 there is an optimal temperature that you want in your house you set your thermostat when it gets too cold in the house your thermostat kicks in and says hey we need to blow
  or if it gets too hot your thermostat registers turn the a c on cool us off that
 's exactly how your thyroid works in your body
  your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body  if it gets too cold your thyroid says hey we need to heat up if it gets too hot your thyroid cools you down  
 but what happens when your thyroid is not functioning well  
 when it doesn 't function then it shows up in your body temperatures they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic
 and so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid 
 now  what is it if you had a thyroid problem and you went to the doctor your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood 
 fine  but the problem with that test is it doesn 't tell you how active the hormone is in
  so you might have a lot of hormone present  but it might not be actively working to regulate your body temperature so just by collecting your temperature every day  you get information about the condition of your thyroid  
 so what if you don 't want to take your temperature every day  i advocate that you do but there are tons of other things you could take you could take your blood pressure you could take your weight
 yeah who 's excited about taking their weight every day 
 early on in our marriage  donald had a stuffy nose
  and he had been taking a slew of medications to try to
 relieve his stuffy nose 
 to no avail  and so that night he comes and he wakes me up and he says honey  i can 't breath out of my nose 
 and i roll over and i look and i said well can you breath out of your mouth
  i can 't breath out of my nose and so like any good wife i rush him to the emergency room
 at two o 'clock in the morning and the whole time i 'm driving and i 'm thinking  you can 't die on me now
 we just got married  people will think i killed
  and so we get to the emergency room and the nurse sees us and he can 't breath out of his nose  and so she brings us to the back and and the doctor says what seems to be the problem and he goes i can 't breath out of my nose and he said 
 you can 't breath out of your nose  no  but he can breath out of his mouth 
 he takes a step back and he looks at both of us and he says sir i think i know the problem
  a heart attack i 'm going to order an ekg and a cat scan for you immediately 
  not a heart attack he can breathe just
 out of his mouth  no no  no  no  no  and so we go back and forth with this doctor because we think this is the incorrect
  and so fortunately for us this doctor was at the end of the shift
 so this new doctor comes in he sees us clearly distraught with a husband who can 't breath out of his nose 
 and he starts asking us questions he says well  
  what was donald doing just before so donald goes into this slew of medications
  i took this decongestant and then i took this nasal spray and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says oh  you should never mix this decongestant with this nasal spray  
 clogs you up every time here take this one instead he gives us a prescription 
 we 're looking at each other and i looked at the doctor and i said why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diagnose his condition but this previous doctor wanted to order an ekg
  man walks in the emergency room and says he can 't breath you assume he 's having a heart attack and you ask questions later 
 now emergency room doctors are trained to make decisions quickly  but not always accurately  
 and so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him maybe we would have gotten a better diagnosis the first time
  i want you to consider the following chart of systolic blood pressure measurements from october two thousand and ten to july two thousand and twelve you
 'll see that these measurements start in the 
 hypertension zone  but over about the course of a year and a half they move into the normal zone this is about the heart rate of a healthy
  telling you 
 obviously it 's the data from someone who 's made a drastic transformation  
 and fortunately for us that person happens to be here today  
 so that 350 pound guy that walked into the emergency room with me is now an even sexier and healthier
 blood pressure trace  so over the course of that year and a half
 donald 's eating changed and our exercise regimen changed and his heart rate responded his blood pressure responded to that change that he made in his body
