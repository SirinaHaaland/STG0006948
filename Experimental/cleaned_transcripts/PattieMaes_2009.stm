  i 've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access
  or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we 're coming across  
 and some of you may argue well don 't today 's cell phones do that already but i would say no 
 when you meet someone here at ted and this is the top networking place of course of the year you don 't shake somebody 's hand and then say can you hold on for a moment while i take out my phone and
  google you or
 when you go to the supermarket and you 're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers 
 you don 't take out your cell phone and open a browser and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make 
 so we don 't really have easy access to all
  this relevant information that can just help us make
 optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take and so my research group at the media lab has been
 developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy
  without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior  and i 'm here to unveil
 our latest effort and most successful effort so far which is still very much a work in process i
 'm actually wearing the device right now and
 we 've sort of cobbled it together with
 components that are off the shelf and that by the way only cost three hundred and fifty dollars at this point in time
  camera just a simple web cam a portable
  battery powered projection system with a little mirror these components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the
 communication and computation device and in the video here we see my student pranav
  who 's really the genius who 's been implementing and designing this whole system 
 and we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected 
 in front of him the system tracks the four significant fingers in this case he 's wearing simple marker
 caps that you may recognize but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors 
 and the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes
 any gestures that he 's making so he can just go to for example a map of long beach zoom in and out etc  
 the system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the take a picture gesture and then takes a picture of whatever
  is in front of you
  and when he then walks back to the media lab he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he 's taken 
 sort through them and organize them and re size them etc again using all natural gestures 
 so some of you
 most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by
  jeff han or some of you may think well doesn 't this look like the microsoft surface table 
 and yes you also interact using natural gestures  both hands etc  
 but the difference here is that you can use any surface you can walk up to any surface  including your hand if nothing else is available  
 and interact with this projected data the device is completely
 portable  and can be applause ends
 so one important difference is that it 's 
  totally mobile another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today 's cell phones and would actually not
  bigger packaging could look a lot more stylish than this
 version that i 'm wearing around my neck
  but other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as tom cruise in minority report 
 the reason why we 're really excited about this device
 is that it
 really can act as one of these
 sixth sense devices
 that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you so
 we see pranav here going into the supermarket and he 's shopping for some paper towels 
 and as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he 's picking up using either image recognition or marker technology  and give him the green light
  or an orange light he can ask for additional information so this particular
 choice here is a particularly good choice given his personal criteria some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice 
  if he picks up a book in the bookstore he can get an amazon rating it gets projected right on the cover of the book this is
 juan 's book our previous speaker  which gets a great rating by the way at amazon  
 and so pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book reader comments  maybe
  sort of information by his favorite critic etc  if he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation
 by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page 
 reading the newspaper it never has to be
 outdated you can get video annotations of the events that you 're reading about you can get the latest sports scores
  this is a more controversial one 
 as you interact with someone at ted  maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags the words that are associated with that person
 in their blog and personal web pages in this case the student is interested in cameras
  on your way to the airport if you pick up your boarding pass it can tell you that your flight is delayed that the gate has changed etc  
 and if you need to know what the current time is it 's as simple as
 drawing a watch 
 on your arm 
 so that 's where we 're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give
  us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across 
 my student pranav who 's really like i said the genius behind
  he does deserve
 a lot of applause because i don 't think he 's slept much in the last three months actually  and his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either
  but it 's not perfect yet it 's very much a work in progress  and who knows
  in another ten years we 'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant  thank you
