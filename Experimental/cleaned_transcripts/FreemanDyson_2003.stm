  how will we be remembered in two hundred years  i happen to live in a little town princeton in new jersey which
 every year celebrates the great event in princeton history the battle of princeton  
 which was in fact a very important battle it was the first battle that george washington won in fact
 was
 pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence it happened two hundred and twenty five years ago  
 it was actually a terrible disaster for princeton  
 the town was burned down it was in the middle of winter  and it was a very very severe winter  
 and about a quarter of all the people in princeton died that winter from hunger and cold
  but nobody remembers that 
 what they remember is of course the great triumph that the brits were beaten and we won  
 and that that the country was born  
 and so i agree very emphatically that
 the pain of childbirth is not remembered it 's the child that 's remembered  and that 's what we 're going through at this time
 i wanted to just
 talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology  because i think i know very little about that i 'm not a biologist
 so
 everything i know about it can be said in one minute 
 what i 'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic
  that what really turned computers
 into a great success in the world as a whole is toys 
 as soon as computers became toys when kids could come home and play with them 
 then the the industry really took off  and that has to happen with biotech there 's a huge
  who are practical biologists who are dog breeders  pigeon breeders
  orchid breeders  rose breeders people who
 handle biology with their hands  and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things beautiful
  these people will be empowered with biotech  and that will be an enormous positive
 step to acceptance
 of biotechnology  that will blow away a lot of the opposition  when people have this
  buy the software you design it 
 i won 't say anymore  you can take it on from there 
  i think it has to happen before
 the technology
 becomes natural becomes part of the human condition 
 something that everybody 's familiar with and everybody accepts so let 's
 leave that aside i want to talk about something quite different which is what i know
  and that is astronomy and i 'm interested in searching for life in the universe  and it 's
 open to us to introduce a new way of doing that and
 that 's what i 'll talk about for ten minutes or whatever the time remains  
 the important fact is that most of the real estate that 's accessible
  to us i 'm not talking about the stars i 'm talking about the solar system the stuff that 's within reach
 for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes
 most of the real estate is very cold
 and very far from the sun  if you look at the solar system as we know it today  it has a few planets close to the sun that 's where we
  it has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between
 the orbit of the earth out through to
 the orbit of jupiter  the asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate but not very large  
 and it 's not very promising for life  since most of it consists of rock and metal mostly rock 
 it 's
 not only cold but very dry
  so the asteroids we don 't have much hope for 
 there stand some interesting places a little further out 
 the moons of jupiter and saturn particularly there 's a place called europa which is europa is one of the moons of jupiter 
 where we see a very
  which looks as if it 's floating on top of an ocean  so we believe that on europa there is in fact a deep ocean and
 that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore 
 ocean
 probably
 the most likely place for life to originate just as it originated on the earth  so
 we would love to explore europa to go down through the ice
  find out who is swimming around in the ocean  whether there are fish
 or seaweed or sea monsters whatever there may be that 's exciting or cephalopods  
 but that 's hard to do  
 unfortunately the ice is thick we don 't know just how thick it is probably miles thick so it 's very expensive and very
 to go down there send down your submarine or whatever it is
 and explore that 's something we don 't yet know how to do there are plans to do it  but it 's hard 
 go out a bit further you 'll find that beyond the orbit of neptune way out far from the sun 
  that 's where the real estate really begins you 'll find
 millions or trillions or billions of objects
 which in what we call the kuiper belt or the oort cloud these are clouds of small objects
 which
 appear as comets when they fall close to the sun  mostly they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system  
 but they are biologically
 very interesting indeed because they consist primarily of ice
 with other minerals which are just the right ones for developing life so if life could be established out there 
 it would have all the essentials
 chemistry and sunlight
 everything that 's needed 
 so what i 'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life rather than on mars  although mars is
  course also a very promising and interesting place but we can look outside very cheaply
 and in a simple fashion and that 's what i 'm going to talk about there is a
 imagine that life originated on europa and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years  
 it 's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the
  surface  just as it did on the earth  staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for two billion years finally came out onto the land  
 and then of course it had great much greater freedom  
 and a much greater variety of creatures
 developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy 
  life had originated
 on europa in the ocean  it could also have moved out onto the surface there wouldn 't have been any air there it 's a vacuum it is out
 in the cold  but it still could have come  you can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp
 through cracks in the ice growing on the surface what would they need in order to grow on the surface they 'd need first of all
 to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the through the skin  
 so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin  
 but better what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight the sunlight in jupiter
  on the satellites of jupiter is
 twenty five times fainter than it is here  
 since jupiter is five times as far from the sun  so they would have to have these creatures which i call sunflowers  which i imagine living on the surface of europa 
 would have to have
 either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight  so they could keep themselves
  they would be at a temperature of minus one hundred and fifty which is certainly not favorable for developing life at least of the kind we know  
 but if they just simply could grow like leaves little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight then they could keep warm on the surface  
 they could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight
 and have roots going down into the ocean life
  then could flourish much more so why not look of course it 's not very likely that there 's life on the surface of europa  none of these things is likely 
 but my 
 my philosophy is look for what 's detectable not for what 's probable there 's a long history in astronomy
 of unlikely things turning out to be there and i mean the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a
  whole this was originally when radio astronomy began
  the bell labs  detected
 radio waves coming from the sky  and the regular astronomers were scornful about this they said
  it 's all right  you can detect radio waves from the sun  
 but the sun is the only object in the universe that 's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable  
 you can easily calculate
 that radio waves from the sun are fairly faint  and everything else in the universe is millions of
 times further away  so it certainly will not be detectable  
  that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about twenty years  
 since there was nothing there you might as well not look well 
 of course as soon as anybody did look  which was after about twenty years  
 when radio astronomy really took off because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things
  brighter than the sun  so the same thing could be true for this
 kind of life which i 'm talking about on cold objects that
 it could in fact be very abundant
 all over the universe  and it 's not been detected just because we haven 't taken the trouble to look so
 the last thing i want to talk about is how to detect it
  something called pit lamping that 's the phrase which i learned from my son george who is there in the audience  you take that 's a
 canadian expression 
 if you happen to want to hunt animals at night  you take a miner 's lamp which is a pit lamp  
 you strap it onto your forehead  so you can see
 the reflection in the eyes of the animal so if you go out at night
 you shine a flashlight  the animals
 are bright you see the red glow in their eyes  which is the reflection of the flashlight  and then if you 're
 one of these unsporting
 characters  you shoot the animals and take them home and of course that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime so in canada
  that 's illegal  in new zealand it 's legal because the new zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits because
 the rabbits compete with the sheep  in new zealand  so the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps 
 and
 shine the headlights  and anything that doesn 't look like a sheep you shoot
  so i have proposed to apply the same trick
 to looking for life in the universe that if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces either on europa  or further out 
 anywhere where you can live on a cold surface
 those creatures must be provided with reflectors 
 in order to concentrate sunlight they have to have lenses and mirrors in order to keep themselves warm  and then when you shine sunlight
  at them  the sunlight will be reflected back just as it is in the eyes of an animal  
 so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings  and the further out you go in this 
 away from the sun  the more powerful this reflection will be so actually this method of of hunting for life
 gets stronger
  and stronger as you go further away  because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in
 contrast against the dark background  
 so as you go further away from the sun  this becomes more and more powerful 
 so in fact you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the earth
  why aren 't we doing it simply because nobody thought of it yet 
 but i hope that we shall look and with any
 we probably won 't find anything none of these speculations may have any basis in fact
  but still  it 's a good chance and of course if it happens it will transform our view of life
  it means that
 the way life can live out there 
 it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet  it 's extremely hard to move from one planet to another 
 we 're having great difficulties at the moment
 and
 any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck especially if you breathe air  it 's very hard to get from planet
  if you live in a vacuum if you live on the surface of one of these objects say in the kuiper belt this an object like pluto or one of the smaller
  in the neighborhood of pluto  
 and you happened if you if you 're living on the surface there and you get knocked off the surface by a collision  
 then it doesn 't change anything all that much you still are on a piece of ice  
 you can still have sunlight and you can still survive
 while you 're traveling from one place to another  and then if you run into another
  you can stay there and colonize the other object so life will spread then from one object to another  so if it if it exists at all in the kuiper belt  
 it 's likely to to be very widespread and you will have then a great
 competition amongst species darwinian evolution so there 'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one
 place to another without having to wait for a collision  and there 'll be advantages for spreading out
  long  sort of kelp like forest
 of vegetation i call these creatures sunflowers they look like  maybe like sunflowers they have to be all the time pointing toward the sun  
 and they will be able to
 spread out in space because gravity on these objects is weak  so they can collect sunlight from a big area  so they will in fact be quite easy
  us to detect
