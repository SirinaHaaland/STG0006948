  a little bit of music here
  okay
  okay
 the
 the
  i 'm really excited to talk a bit about
 my own upbringing in music and family and all of that  but i 'm even more excited
 for you people to hear about donnell 's amazing family and
 and maybe even a little bit about how we met and all that sort of thing  but
 for those of you that may
  i 'm from cape breton island  nova scotia  eastern canada  which is a very very musical island and its origins
 come from scotland with the music and all the traditions the dancing the language  which unfortunately is dying out in cape breton  
 the traditional language is gaelic but a lot of the music
 came from the gaelic language and the dancing and the singing and everything and my
 my bloodline is scottish through and through  
 but my mother and father are two are two very very musical people my mom taught me to dance when i was
  my dad taught me to play fiddle when i was nine
  my uncle is a very well known cape breton fiddler  his name 's buddy macmaster  and just a wonderful guy  and
 we have a great tradition at home called square dancing and we had parties great parties at our house and the neighbors ' houses and
  first of all is gaelic for party but
 kitchen party in cape breton is very common and basically somebody drops into the house and
 no matter what house you go to in cape breton there 's a fiddle there guaranteed  
 and i 'd say  well there 's first of all more fiddlers per capita in cape breton than anywhere in the world so ten chances to one the fellow who walked in the door could play it 
 so you 'd have
  come into the house you 'd invite them to play a tune and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance and somebody would sing and all that sort of thing so
 it was a wonderful wonderful way to grow up and that is where my beginnings in music come from my surroundings my family just my bloodline in itself 
 and oh 
 i 've done lots of things with my music i 've recorded lots of cds i was
  a grammy and i 've won some awards and stuff like that so that 's
 awesome  but the best part was meeting my husband  and i 've actually known donnell for
 probably twelve years now  and
 i 'm going to get into a little bit of i guess how music brought us together  but i 'm going to introduce you right now
 to my new husband as of october five 
 donnell leahy donnell leahy 
 thank you i 'm kind of new to the ted experience and i 'm glad to be here but
  'm just trying to put it all together trying to figure all you people out and i
 've been here for a short while and i 'm starting to understand a little bit better  so i asked natalie what do i do and she said just talk about yourself it 's kind of boring but i 'll just tell you a little bit about
 my my family  i 'm one of eleven brothers and sisters from lakefield ontario 
 an hour and a half northeast of toronto and we grew up on a farm mom and dad
  i 'm the oldest boy there are four girls a little bit older than me  we grew up without a television people find that strange  but
 i think it was a great blessing for us  we had a television television for a few years but
 of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn 't getting done
  so out went the television  we grew up playing mom 's from cape breton
  coincidentally mom
 and natalie 's mother knew each other  we grew up playing and used to dance together right yeah we grew up playing
 a bunch of we played by ear and i think that 's that 's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music  
 we learned to play the instruments but we kind of had to to
 come from within or go from within  because we didn 't watch
  television we didn 't listen to a lot of radio we went to church and to school sometimes and
 farmed and played music so we were able i think at a very critical age to develop
 our own style our own self  and my mother plays my father plays  and the style
 that came from the
  originated in logging camps years ago  
 hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the to the camps in northern ontario and in quebec  and they were all different
 cultures and
 the irish the french scottish german they 'd all meet and of course at night they 'd play cards and step dance and play
  and over the course of many years the ottawa valley fiddling kind of evolved and the ottawa valley step
 valley step dancing evolved  so that 's i kind of started out with that style and i quickly
 started doing my own thing  and then i met natalie  and i was exposed to the great cape breton fiddling that 's how we met
  it 's just so interesting that donnell 's upbringing was very similar to mine  and
 i actually saw donnell play when i was about twelve years old  and he and his family came to
  minutes from where i lived  and
 i was just blown away like it was just amazing and you 'll find out why pretty soon here but i couldn 't believe the fiddling
 and mom was there with me and she was saying
 donnell 's mother came up on stage and danced with her children and mom was saying that 's julie macdonnell
  i used to dance with her when we were kids little did i think our children would be playing instruments
  music  yeah twelve years er twenty years later little did she think her kids would be getting married  but anyway
  so then i got a phone call about i dunno 
 seven years later  i was nineteen first or second year of college  and it was donnell and
  you probably don 't know me but my name is donnell leahy and i said i know you i have a tape of yours at home and
 he said well i 'm in truro which is where i was  and
 he asked me out for supper
  play a piece of music for you  it 's actually a scottish piece i 've chosen i starts out with a slow air airs were played in in europe
 at
 burials as a body was carried out from the wake site to the
  site the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player i 'll quickly play a
 short
 part of the the air and then i 'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you 're not warmed up so 
 if i mess it up pretend you like it anyway it 's called the banks
 i
  and
  we 're
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
  are totally different 
  you know donnell and i are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play but we don 't have any of those ready we just started yesterday 
 so we 're gonna play something together anyway 
 dl with one minute
 to
 the
  okay
  another ten minutes
  a tune and natalie 's going to accompany me on the piano the cape breton piano playing is is just awesome  it 's very rhythmic and
 you 'll see it my mom plays piano and she learned to play before they they had a piano at home
 in cape breton  before mom 's family had a piano in cape breton she learned to play
 the rhythms on on a piece of board and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter 's evenings and mom would be banging on this board so when
 they
 bought a piano they bought it in toronto and had it
 taken by train and brought in on a horse a
 horse and sleigh to the house it became the only piano in the region and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived
 she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms anyway  we found the piano last year and were able to
 bring it back home we purchased it it had gone through like five or six families and
 it was just a big thing for us  and we found actually an old picture
 of somebody and their
  we had a great opportunity we opened for shania twain for two years on her international
  tour it was a big thing for us and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married so we 're
 staying close to home for for i guess another couple of weeks  what can i say i
  family we had seven girls four boys we had two fiddles and one piano and of course we were all fighting
  on the instruments  so dad and mom set a rule that
 you couldn 't kick anyone off the instrument 
 you had to wait until they were finished so of course what we would do is we 'd get on the piano and you wouldn 't even get off to eat because you you wouldn 't want to give it up to your
 to your brother or sister and they 'd wait and wait and wait and it 'd be midnight and you 'd be still sitting there on the piano but it was their their way to get us to practice will we play a tune
  so this is our last number and we 'll feature nat on piano
 the
 the
 that
