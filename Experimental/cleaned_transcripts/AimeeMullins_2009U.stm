  i was speaking to a group of about three hundred kids 
 ages six to eight at a children 's museum  and i brought with me a bag full of legs similar to the kinds of things you see up here and had them laid out on a table
  kids are naturally curious
 about what they don 't know or don 't understand or is foreign to them 
 they only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way  and maybe censors that natural curiosity or you know reins in 
  the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids so  i just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby
  that 's the point that 's why i was there i wanted to invite them to look and explore  so i made a deal
 with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes
 on their own  the doors open 
 the kids descend on this table of legs and they are poking and prodding and they 're wiggling toes and they 're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that
  said kids really quickly
 i woke up this morning  i decided i wanted to be able to jump over a house
 nothing too big two or three stories but  if you could think of any animal any superhero any cartoon character anything you can dream up right now 
 what kind of legs would you build me 
 and immediately
 a voice shouted
  why wouldn 't you want to fly too and the whole room including me was like yeah 
 and just like that i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as
  somebody that had potential that their bodies didn 't have yet somebody that might even be super abled interesting so some of you
 actually saw me at ted eleven years ago and
 there 's been a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees and i am no exception
  was the launch pad
 to the next decade of my life 's exploration 
 at the time  the legs i presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics i had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah which you may have seen on stage yesterday  
 and
 also these very life like intrinsically painted silicone legs so at the time
 was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community
 to come bring their talent to the science and to the art
 of building legs so that we can stop compartmentalizing form  function and aesthetic and assigning them different values well 
 lucky for me a lot of people answered that call  
 and the journey started funny enough with
 a ted conference attendee chee pearlman who
  hopefully is in the audience somewhere today she was the editor then of a magazine called id  
 and she gave me a cover story 
 this started an incredible journey curious encounters were happening to me at the time i 'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak
 on the design of the cheetah legs around the world and
 people would come up to me after the conference after my talk men and women  and the conversation would go
  like this you know aimee  you 're very attractive you don 't look disabled 
 i thought well that 's amazing because i don 't feel disabled and it really opened my eyes to
 this conversation that could be explored about beauty what does a beautiful woman have
  a sexy body and
 interestingly from an identity standpoint what does it mean to have a disability  
 i mean people pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do  nobody calls her disabled 
 so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer peter saville went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen and photographer nick knight who were also interested in exploring that
  conversation so three months after ted i found myself on a plane to london doing my first fashion shoot  which resulted in this cover 
 three months after that i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen
 on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash  nobody knew everyone thought they were wooden boots actually i have them
  on stage with me  grapevines  magnolias truly stunning  poetry
 matters  poetry is what elevates the banal
 and neglected object to a realm of art it can transform
 the thing that
  might have
 made people fearful
 into something that invites them to look and look a little longer  and maybe even understand  
 i learned this firsthand with my next adventure the artist matthew barney in his film opus called the the cremaster cycle 
 this is where it really hit home for me that my legs could be wearable sculpture and even at this point  i started to move away from the need to replicate
 as the only aesthetic ideal  so we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they 're
 actually optically clear polyurethane a k a bowling ball material heavy then we made these legs that are cast in soil
 with a potato root system growing in them and beetroots out the top and a very lovely brass
  little homage to my
 life as an athlete fourteen hours of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that had articulated paws  claws
 and a tail that whipped around like a gecko 
 and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these look like jellyfish legs also polyurethane
  and the only purpose that these legs can serve outside the context of the film is
 to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination so whimsy
 matters  today  i have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me
  and with them i have different negotiations
 of the terrain under my feet and i can change my height i have a variable of five different heights today i 'm six ' one 
 and i had these legs made a little over a year ago at dorset orthopedic in england and when i brought them home to manhattan my first night out on the town i went to a very fancy party 
 and a girl was there who has known me for years at my
  a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts but i have an entirely new relationship to door jams that i never expected i would ever have  and
 i was having fun with it  and she looked at me and she said but aimee that 's not fair
  really meant it it 's not fair that you can change your height as you want it
  the need to replicate
