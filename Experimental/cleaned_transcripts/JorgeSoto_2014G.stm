  almost a year ago my aunt started suffering back pains she went to see the doctor
 and they told her it was a normal injury for someone who had been playing tennis for almost thirty years 
 they recommended that she do some therapy  but after a while she wasn 't feeling better
  decided to do further tests  
 they did an x ray and discovered an injury in her lungs and at the time they thought that the injury was a strain in the muscles and tendons between her ribs  
 but after a few weeks of treatment  again
 her health wasn 't getting any better  so finally they decided to do a biopsy  and two weeks
  the results of the biopsy came back it was stage three lung cancer  
 her lifestyle was almost free of risk  
 she never smoked a cigarette  she never drank alcohol  and she had been playing sports for almost half her life 
 perhaps that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed 
 my story might
  familiar to most of you one out of three people sitting in this audience
 will be diagnosed with some type of cancer and one out of four will die because of it 
 not only did that cancer diagnosis change the life of our family  but that process of going back and forth
 with new tests  different doctors describing symptoms discarding diseases
 over and over was stressful and frustrating
  for my aunt  and that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done since the beginning of history  we have 
 medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer  but we still have 20th century procedures and processes for diagnosis if any 
 today  most of us have to wait for symptoms to indicate that something is 
 the majority of people still
  have access to early cancer detection methods  even though we know that catching cancer early
 is basically the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against it 
 we know that we can change this in our lifetime  and that is why my team and i have decided to begin this journey 
 this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages and
  easier  cheaper  smarter
 and more accessible than ever before 
 the context of course is that we 're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates 
 and the biological realm is no exception  
 it is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster
  than the growth rate of the processing power of computers  but progress in biotech is not only being accelerated it is also being democratized  just as
 personal computers or the internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship politics or education  
 recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well  
 and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle
 and look at these problems with new approaches we are a team of scientists
 and technologists from chile  panama  mexico  israel and greece  
 and based on recent scientific discoveries  we believe that we have found a reliable
 and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample  
 we do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called
  micrornas 
 to explain what micrornas are and their important role in cancer  i need to start with proteins  because when cancer is present in our body  
 protein modification is observed in all cancerous cells 
 as you might know proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body  
 like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating dna
  but before a protein is expressed or produced  relevant parts of its genetic code
 present in the dna are copied into the messenger rna 
 so this messenger rna has instructions on how to build a specific protein  
 and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build
 are micrornas
 so micrornas are small molecules that regulate gene expression  
 unlike dna which is mainly fixed micrornas can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time
 telling us which genes are actively expressed at that particular moment  
 and that is what makes micrornas such a promising biomarker for cancer  
 because as you know cancer  is a disease of altered gene expression
 it is the uncontrolled regulation of genes
 another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same  but at the microrna level there are patterns 
 several scientific studies have shown
 that abnormal
 microrna expression levels varies and creates a unique specific pattern for each type of cancer  
 even at the early stages  reflecting the progression of the disease
  whether it 's responding to medication or in remission  making micrornas a perfect  highly sensitive biomarker  
 however the problem with micrornas is that we cannot use existing dna based technology to detect them in a reliable way 
 because they are very short sequences of nucleotides much smaller
  and also all micrornas are very similar to each other with just tiny differences  
 so imagine trying to differentiate two molecules  extremely similar  extremely small  
 we believe that we have found a way to do so and this is the first time that we 've shown it in public  let me do a demonstration  
 imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test a
  which is quite simple today  
 and puts it in a standard 96 well plate like this one 
 each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign that is looking for a specific microrna 
 acting like a trap that closes only when the microrna is present in the sample and when it does  it will shine with green color 
 to run the reaction you put the plate inside a device like this one 
 and then you can put your smartphone on top of
 it if we can
  a camera here so you can see my screen 
 a smartphone is a connected computer and it 's also a camera  
 good enough for our purpose 
 the smartphone is taking pictures  and when the reaction is over it will send the pictures to our online database for processing and interpretation 
 this entire process lasts around sixty
  minutes  but when the process is over  wells that shine are matched with the specific micrornas and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine  
 and then when this entire process is over 
 this is
 what happens this chart is showing the specific micrornas present in this sample and how they reacted over time 
 then if we take this specific pattern of microrna
  this person 's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microrna patterns with a specific presence of a disease 
 this is how pancreatic cancer looks like this inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer
  important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information if
 we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer  we need to stop treating them as acute  isolated
  and data science
 to try to tackle one of humanity 's toughest challenges
 since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized  this entire solution costs at least fifty times less
  than current available methods  
 and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more so we 're making the design of the device open source 
 let me say very clearly that we are at the
  so far we have been able to successfully identify the microrna pattern
 of pancreatic cancer  lung cancer  breast cancer and hepatic cancer  and currently we 're doing a clinical trial
 in collaboration with the german cancer research center with two hundred women for breast cancer
  test
 that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done 
 since we 're looking for the microrna patterns in your blood at any given time you don 't need to know which cancer you 're looking for 
 you don 't need to have any symptoms you only need one milliliter of blood
 and a relatively simple
  cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear 
 that is at stage three or four and i believe that is too late it is too expensive for our families it is too expensive for humanity  
 we cannot lose the war against cancer it not only costs us billions of dollars but it also costs us the people we love
 today my aunt
  she 's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude  
 however  i want fights like this to become very rare  
 i want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages and i 'm certain
 that in the very near future  
 because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences the way we see cancer will radically change  
 it will give us the chance of detecting it early
 understanding it better  and finding a cure  thank you very much
