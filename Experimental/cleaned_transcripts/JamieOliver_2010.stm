  in the next eighteen minutes when i do our chat four americans that are alive will be dead through the food that they eat
  from essex in england and
 for the last seven years i 've worked
 fairly tirelessly to
 save lives in my own way i 'm not a doctor  i 'm a chef  i don 't have expensive equipment
 or medicine i use information education i profoundly believe that the power of food has
  a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life  
 we have an awful awful
 reality right now  
 america you 're at the top of your game  this is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world 
 can i please just see a raise of hands for
 how many of you have children in this room today put your hands up
 you can continue to put your hands up aunties and uncles as well  most of you  
 ok  we the adults of the last four generations have blessed our children
 with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents
  your child will live a life ten years younger than you
 because of the landscape of food that we 've built around them two thirds
 of this room today in america are statistically overweight or obese  
 you lot you 're all right but we 'll get you eventually don 't worry 
 the statistics of bad health are clear  very clear  
 we spend our lives being paranoid about death murder  homicide you name
  's on the front page of every paper  cnn look at homicide at the bottom for god 's sake right 
 every single one of those in the red
 is a diet related disease  any doctor any specialist will
  disease is the biggest killer in the united states right now  here today  
 this is a global problem it
 's a catastrophe  it 's sweeping the world  england is right behind you as usual 
 i know they were close but not that close  
  all have massive problems of obesity and bad health 
 think about smoking it costs way less than obesity now  obesity costs you americans ten percent
 of your health care bills one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year  
 in ten years it 's set to double  three hundred billion dollars a year let 's be honest guys you haven 't got that cash
 i came here
 to start a food revolution that i so profoundly believe in we need it the time is now 
  moment  i 've been doing this for seven years i 've been trying in america for seven years  now is the time when it 's ripe
 ripe for the picking  i went to the eye of the storm  i went to west virginia
  the most unhealthy state in america or it was last year we 've got a new one this year but we 'll work on that next season 
 huntington west virginia  beautiful town i wanted to put heart and soul and people 
 your public 
 around the statistics that we 've become
 so used to  i want to introduce you to some of the people that i care about your public your children  i want to show a picture
 of my friend brittany  she 's sixteen years old  she 's got six years to live
 because of the food that she 's eaten  she 's the third generation of americans that hasn 't grown up within a food environment where they 've been taught to cook at home or 
  in school  or her mom or her mom 's mom she has six years to live 
 stacy the edwards family  this is a normal family guys  stacy does her best but she 's 
  as well she was never taught to cook at home or at school  the family 's obese  justin here twelve years old he 's three hundred and fifty pounds  he gets bullied for god 's sake  the daughter there katie she 's four years old  she 's obese before she even gets to primary
  she 's all right  she 's one of your lot  but you know what her father  who was obese  died in her arms  and then the second most important man in her life her uncle  died of obesity 
 and now her step dad is obese  
 you see the thing is  obesity and diet related disease doesn 't just hurt the people that have it it 's all of their friends families brothers sisters
  pastor steve an inspirational man one of my early allies in huntington west virginia  he 's at the sharp 
 of this problem  he has to bury the people ok  and he 's fed up with it he 's fed up with burying his friends his family his community  
 come winter three times as many people die he 's sick of it  this is preventable
  waste of life
 by the way this is what they get buried in we
 're not geared up to do this can 't even get them out the door and i 'm being serious can 't even get them there forklift ok 
 i see it as a triangle ok  this is our landscape of food i need you to understand it you 've probably heard all this before 
 over the last thirty years  what 's happened that 's ripped the heart out of this country let 's be frank
  let 's start with the main street  
 fast food has taken over the whole country  we know that the big brands are some of the most important powers  powerful powers in this country 
 supermarkets as well  big companies  big companies
  thirty years ago most of the food was largely local and largely fresh now it 's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives
  and you know the rest of the story  portion size is obviously a massive massive problem  
 labeling is a massive problem the labeling in this country is a disgrace
  the industry wants to self police themselves what in this kind of climate they don 't deserve it
  how can you say something is low fat when it 's full of so much sugar home 
 the biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on
 food food culture  
 what made our society that is not happening anymore  and you know as we go to work and as life changes and as life always evolves  we kind of have to look at it
  for thirty years ok  i want to show you a situation that is very normal right now the edwards family
  i want my kids to succeed in life and this isn 't going to get them there but i 'm killing them
  fairly much a specialist in  
 ok  school
 what is school who invented it what 's the purpose of school school was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative do wonderful things make us earn a living etc etc you know it
 's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long long time ok  
 but we haven 't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of america
  school food
 is something that most kids thirty one million a day actually
 have twice a day  more than often breakfast and lunch one
 hundred and eighty days of the year  so you could say that school food is quite important really judging the circumstances
  before i crack into my rant  which i 'm sure you 're waiting for 
 i need to say one thing and it 's so important
 in hopefully the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months  the lunch ladies the lunch cooks of america
 i offer myself as their ambassador i 'm not slagging them off
  they 're doing the best they can do 
 they 're doing their best  
 but they 're doing what they 're told and what they 're being told to do is wrong  the system is highly run by accountants  there 's not enough or any
  people in the business  there 's a problem  if you 're not a food expert  and you 've got tight budgets and it 's getting tighter  then you can 't be creative you can 't duck and dive and write different things around things if you 're an accountant  and a
  only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit 
 now  the reality is the food that your kids get every day is fast food it 's highly processed  there 's not enough fresh food in there at all you know the amount of additives 
  e numbers  ingredients you wouldn 't believe there 's not enough veggies at all french fries are considered a vegetable  pizza for breakfast they don 't even get get crockery knives and forks no they 're too dangerous
  dangerous they have scissors in the classroom but knives and forks no and the way i look at it is if you don 't have knives and forks in your school you 're purely endorsing  
 from a state level fast food because it 's handheld  
 and yes by the way it is fast food it 's sloppy joes  it 's burgers it 's wieners  it 's pizzas it 's all of that stuff 
 ten percent of what we spend on health care as i said earlier
 is on obesity and it 's going to double
 we 're not teaching our kids  there 's no statutory right to teach kids about food elementary or secondary school  ok  we don 't teach kids about food 
 right  and this is this is a little clip from an elementary school which is very common
  immediately you get a really clear sense of do the kids know anything about where food comes from
  got to start teaching our kids about food in schools  period 
  i want to tell you about something that kind of
 kind of epitomizes the trouble that we 're in guys ok
 i want to talk about something so basic as milk 
 every kid has the right to milk at school  your kids will be having milk at school breakfast and lunch right they 'll be having two bottles  ok  and most kids do but milk ain 't good enough anymore
 probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings colorings and sugar in milk  more kids will drink it  
 yeah
  obviously now that 's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they 'll eat more as well do you know what i mean
  for me  there isn 't any need to flavor the milk  okay there 's sugar in everything i know the ins and outs of those
 's in everything even the milk hasn 't escaped
 the kind of modern day problems  there 's our milk  there 's our carton  in that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop and they are having two a day  so  let me just show you  we 've got one kid 
 here
 having  
  the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar 
 just from milk 
 now i don 't know about you guys  but judging the circumstances right  any judge in the whole world
  would look at the statistics and the evidence  and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse 
 that 's my belief 
 now  
 if i came up here and i wish i could come up here today and hang a cure for aids or cancer you 'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me
  this all this bad news is preventable that 's the good news  it 's very very preventable 
 so let 's just think about we got a problem here  we need to reboot  
 okay so in my world  what do we need to do here is the thing right  it cannot just come from one source to
  and make real tangible change  
 real change so that i could look you in the white of the eyes and say in ten years ' time the history of your children 's lives happiness and let 's not forget you 're clever if you eat well  you know you 're going to live longer
 all of that stuff it will look different ok 
 so  supermarkets where else do you shop so religiously week in week out how much money do you spend in your
  they just sell us what we want all right  they owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket  
 they need to help us shop  they need to show us how to cook quick  tasty seasonal
 meals for people that are busy  this is not expensive it is done in some and it needs to be done across the board in america soon and quick  
 the big brands you know the food brands need to put food education at the heart of their businesses
  i know  easier said than done  it 's the future  it 's the only way  fast food with the fast food industry
 you know  it 's very competitive  i 've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food
 restaurants i know how they do it i mean  basically they 've weaned us on to these hits of sugar
  and everyone loves them 
 right  so these guys are going to be part of the solution  but we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry and over a five six 
 seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat sugar and all the other non food ingredients now  also back to the sort of big brands  labeling i said 
  earlier is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted 
  obviously in schools  we owe it to them to make sure those one hundred and eighty days of the year  from that little precious age of four until eighteen twenty twenty four whatever  they need to be cooked
 proper fresh food
 from local growers on site ok  there needs to be a new standard of fresh proper food for your children
  it 's profoundly important that every single american child leaves school knowing how to cook ten recipes that will save their life 
 life skills 
 that means that they can be students  young parents and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of
  no matter what recession hits them next time if you can cook recession money doesn 't matter  if you can cook time doesn 't matter 
 the workplace we haven 't really talked about it  
 you know  it 's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff the staff are the moms and dads of 
  america 's children marissa her father died in her hand  i think she 'd be quite happy if corporate america could start feeding their staff properly
  definitely they shouldn 't be left out let 's go back to the home now look if we do all this stuff and we can it 's so achievable you can care and be commercial absolutely  but the home needs to start passing on cooking again for sure 
 for sure pass it on as a philosophy  
 and for me it 's quite romantic  but it 's about
  if one person teaches three people how to cook something
 and they teach three of their mates that only has to repeat itself twenty five times and that 's the whole population of america romantic  yes  
 but most importantly  
 it 's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference  we 've got to put back what 's been lost  
 huntington 's kitchen  
 huntington where i
  made this program we 've got this prime time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change  i truly believe that change will happen huntington 's kitchen i work with a community  
 i worked in the schools  i found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area from the junk  onto the fresh food
  which is ten percent of their population and it 's people on people you know it 's local cooks teaching local people it 's free cooking lessons guys in the main street  
 this is real tangible change  real tangible change 
 around america  if we just look back now  there is plenty of wonderful things going on
  there are amazing people doing this already the problem is they all want to roll out what they 're doing to the next school but there 's no cash  
 we need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly  identify them and allow
  allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they 're already doing and doing well  
 businesses of america need to support mrs obama to do the things that she wants to do and
 i know it 's weird having an english person standing here before you talking about all this all i can say is i care  
 i 'm a father  and i love this country  
 and i believe truly
  actually that if change can be made in this country  
 beautiful things will happen around the world if america does it other people will follow  it 's incredibly important yeah 
 when i was in huntington trying to get a few things to work when they
  i had a magic wand 
 what would i do and i thought you know what i 'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in america 
 and a month later ted phoned me up and gave me this award  
 i 'm here  
 so my wish
  bit slow 
 my wish
 is for you to help a strong sustainable movement to educate every child
 about food to inspire families to cook
  to empower people everywhere to fight obesity
