  two weeks ago  i was sitting at the
 kitchen table with my wife katya and we were talking about what i was going to talk about today 
  his name is lincoln he was sitting at the same table doing his math homework  and during a pause
 in my conversation with katya i looked over at lincoln and i was suddenly thunderstruck
 by a recollection of a client of mine my client was a guy named will he was from north
  he never knew his father very well because his father
 left his mom while she was pregnant with him  
 and so he was destined to be raised by a single mom which might have been all right
 except that this particular single mom
 was a paranoid schizophrenic  and when will was five years old she tried to kill him with a butcher knife 
 she was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric
  hospital  and so for the next several years will lived with his older brother  until he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart  
 and after that will bounced around from one family member to another  
 until by the time he was nine years old he was essentially living on his own  
 that morning that i was sitting with katya and lincoln  i looked at my son  and i realized
 that when my client will was his age  he 'd been living by himself for two years 
 will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes  
 including most seriously of all 
 a horrible tragic
  will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime  
 but i don 't want to
 talk today about the morality of capital punishment i certainly think that my client
 shouldn 't have been executed but what i would like to do today instead
 is talk about the death penalty in a way i 've never done before in a way that is entirely
 noncontroversial  
 i think that 's possible because there is a corner of the death penalty debate maybe the most important corner
 where everybody agrees where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous
  are on exactly the same page that 's the corner i want to explore 
 before i do that though i want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds  
 and then i want to tell you two lessons that i have learned over the last twenty years
 as a death penalty lawyer
 from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way you can think of a death penalty case as a
  story that has four chapters  
 the first chapter of every case is exactly the same  and it is tragic  it begins with the murder of an innocent human being  
 and it 's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate
  the second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding known as a state habeas corpus appeal 
 the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding and the fourth chapter
 is one where a variety of things can happen the lawyers might file a clemency petition  
 they might initiate even more complex litigation or they might not do anything at all  but that fourth chapter always ends
 with an execution
  when i started representing death row inmates more than twenty years ago  
 people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story  
 they were on their own  
 in fact it wasn 't until the late 1980s that they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story  
 so what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers
  to handle their legal proceedings  
 the problem is that there were way more guys on death row than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases  
 and so inevitably lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four
 that makes sense of course those are the cases that are most urgent those are the guys who are closest to being executed  some of these lawyers were successful they managed to get new trials
  trials for their clients  others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients sometimes by years sometimes by months  but the one thing that didn 't happen
 was that there was never a serious and sustained decline in the number of annual executions in texas  
 in fact as you can see from this graph from the time that the texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid to late 1990s there have only been a couple
  of years where the number of annual executions dipped below twenty 
 in a typical year in texas we 're averaging about two people a month  
 in some years in texas we 've executed close to forty people and this number has never significantly declined over the last fifteen years 
 and yet at the same time that we continue to execute about the same number of people
  every year the number of people who we 're sentencing to death on an annual basis has dropped rather steeply 
 so we have this paradox  which is that the number of annual executions has remained high
 but the number of new death sentences has gone down  why is that 
 it can 't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply
 as the red line on that graph has gone down  what has happened instead is
 that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison
 for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole rather than sending them to the execution chamber  
 why has that happened it hasn 't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty death penalty opponents
  take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in texas is at an all time low 
 do you know what all time low in texas means it means that it 's in the low sixty percent  
 now that 's really good compared to the mid 1980s when it was in excess of eighty percent  but we can 't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity
  for life without the possibility of parole by an erosion of support for the death penalty because people still support the death penalty  what 's happened to cause this phenomenon  
 what 's happened is that lawyers who represent death row inmates have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters of the death penalty story  
 so twenty five years ago they focused on chapter four and they went from chapter
  years ago to chapter three in the late 1980s and they went from chapter three in the late 1980s to chapter two in the mid 1990s and beginning in the mid to late
 1990s they began to focus on chapter one of the story  now you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing i don 't want to have a conversation about that today 
  the earlier you intervene in a case  the greater the likelihood that you 're going to save your client 's life  
 that 's the first thing i 've learned  here 's the second thing i learned  my client will
 was not the exception to the rule  he was the rule  i sometimes say if you tell me the name of a death row inmate
 doesn 't matter what state he 's in doesn 't matter if i 've ever met him before
  i 'll write his biography for you 
 and eight out of ten times  the details of that biography will be more or less accurate 
 and the reason for that is that eighty percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that will did 
 eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system
  that 's the second lesson that i 've learned  now we 're right on the cusp of that corner
 where everybody 's going to agree 
 people in this room might disagree about whether will should have been executed  but i think everybody would agree
 that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs
 how do we do that when our son lincoln was working on that math problem
 two weeks ago it was a big gnarly problem  
 and he was learning how when you have a big old gnarly problem  sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems  that 's what we do for most problems in math
  even in social policy we slice them into smaller more manageable problems  but every once in a while as dwight eisenhower said  
 the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger
 the way we solve this problem
 is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger  
 we have to say all right we have these four chapters of a death penalty story  but what happens before that
  story begins how can we intervene in the life of a murderer
 before he 's a murderer 
 what options do we have to nudge that person off of the path that is going to lead to a result that everybody
 death penalty supporters and death
 penalty opponents still think
 is a bad result the murder of an innocent human being you
 know sometimes people say that something
 isn 't rocket science  and by that what they mean is rocket science is really complicated
 and this problem that we 're talking about now is really simple 
 well that 's rocket science  that 's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket 
 what we 're talking about
  today
 is just as complicated what we 're talking about today is also rocket science my client will
 and eighty percent of the people on death row
 had five chapters in their lives that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story  
 i think of these five chapters as points of intervention
  places in their lives when our society could 've intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that 
  we all death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents say was a bad result  
  in his early childhood years when he was in elementary school when he was in middle school and then high school and when he was in the juvenile justice system during each of those five chapters there were a 
  wide variety of things that society could have done  in fact if we just imagine that there are five different modes of intervention  the way that society could intervene in each 
  of those five chapters  and we could mix and match them any way we want  there are three thousand more than three thousand possible strategies that we could embrace in
  order to nudge kids like will off of the path that they 're on so i 'm not standing here today with the solution but
 the fact that we still have a lot to learn  
 that doesn 't mean that we don 't know a lot already  we know from experience in other states that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention
 that we could be using in
  texas and in every other state that isn 't using them in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad i 'll
 just mention a few  
 i won 't talk today about reforming the legal system  that 's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges 
 instead let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention that we can all help accomplish
  because they are modes of intervention that will come about when legislators and policymakers when taxpayers and citizens agree that that 's what we ought to be doing and that 's how we ought to be spending our money  
 we could be providing early childhood care
 for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids  
 and we could be doing it for free  and we could be nudging kids like will off of the path that
  on there are other states that do that but we don 't 
 we could be providing special schools at both the high school level and the middle school level but even in 
 that target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids and particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system  there are a
  handful of states that do that texas doesn 't 
 there 's one other thing we can be doing well there are a bunch of other things there 's one other thing that i 'm going to mention and this is going to be the only controversial thing that i say today  
 we could be intervening much more aggressively
 into dangerously dysfunctional homes  and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to
  if we 're going to do that we need a place to put them 
 even if we do all of those things some kids are going to fall through the cracks and they 're going to end up in that last chapter before the murder story begins they 're going to end up in the juvenile justice system  and even if that happens 
 it 's not yet too late  there 's still time to nudge them  if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them  
 there are two professors in the northeast one at yale and one at
  maryland they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison  
 and the kids are in prison  but they go to school from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon now it was logistically difficult they had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison  
 they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison
  and most dauntingly of all they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what people don 't come into and out of prison on a semester basis 
 but they did all those things  
 now what do all of these things have in common what all of these things have in common is that they cost money  
 some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial he used to say
 well you can pay me now or you can pay me later what we 're doing in the death penalty system
 is we 're paying later  but the thing is
 that for every fifteen thousand dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters
  we save eighty thousand dollars in crime related costs down the road even if you don 't agree
 that there 's a moral imperative that we do it 
 it just makes economic sense  i want to tell you about the last conversation that i had with will  
 it was
 the day that he was going to be executed and
  we were just
 talking  there was nothing left to do in his case  
 and we were talking about his life  and he was talking first about his dad who he hardly knew who had died  
 and then about his mom who he did know who was still alive  
 and i said to him 
 i know the story i 've read the records  i know
  she tried to kill you i said but i 've always wondered whether you really actually remember that i said i don 't remember anything
 from when i was five years old maybe you just remember somebody telling you 
 and he looked at me and he leaned forward
  and he said professor he 'd known me for twelve years he still called me professor  he said professor i don 't mean any disrespect by this 
 but when your mama
  butcher knife that looks bigger than you are 
 and chases you through the house screaming she 's going to kill you 
 and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there 
 he looked at me and he said that 's something you don 't forget 
 one thing you all won 't forget  
 in between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch  there are going to be four homicides in the united states 
 we 're going to devote enormous social resources to punishing the people who commit those crimes and that 's appropriate because we should punish people who do bad things  
 but three of those crimes are preventable if we make the picture bigger
 and devote our attention to the earlier chapters  then we 're never going to write the first sentence
 that begins the death penalty story  thank you
