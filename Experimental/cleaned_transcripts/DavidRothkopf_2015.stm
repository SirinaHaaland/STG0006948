  what i 'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear and the cost of fear and the age of fear from which we are now emerging i would
 like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that that i know something about fear and
  anxiety i 'm a jewish guy from new jersey i could worry before i could walk 
 laughter please  applaud that thank you 
 but i also grew up in a time
 where there was something to fear we were brought out in the hall when i was a little kid
 and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war 
 now even my  seven year old brain knew that that wasn 't going to work  
 but i also knew that global thermonuclear war was something
 to be concerned with  
  and yet despite the fact that we lived for fifty years
 with the threat of such a war  the response of our government and of our society
 was to do wonderful things  
 we created the space program in response to that we built our highway system in response to that we created the internet in response to that 
 so sometimes fear can produce a constructive response  
 un constructive response 
 on september eleven  two thousand and one  
 nineteen guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings  
 they exacted a horrible toll it is not for us to minimize what that toll was 
  the response that we had was clearly disproportionate
 disproportionate to the point of
 verging on the unhinged  we rearranged the national security apparatus of the united states and of many governments
 to address a threat that at the time that those attacks took place 
 was quite limited  in fact  according to our intelligence services on september eleven  two thousand and one
 there were one hundred members of core al qaeda 
 there were just a few thousand terrorists  they posed an existential threat
 to no one  but
 we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the second
  we launched two wars  
 we spent trillions of dollars  we suspended our values  we violated international law we embraced torture we embraced the idea that if these nineteen guys could do this anybody could do it 
 and therefore for the first time in history  
 we were seeing everybody as a threat  
 and what was the result of that surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries
 hundreds of millions of people setting aside whether those countries were our allies setting aside what our interests were 
 i would argue that fifteen years later  
 since today there are more terrorists more terrorist attacks more terrorist casualties this by the count of
  state department
 since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history since
 the flood  perhaps 
 we have not succeeded in our response now you have to
 ask where did we go wrong what did we do what was the mistake that was made and you might say well look washington is a dysfunctional
  there are political food fights we 've turned our discourse into a cage match  and that 's true  
 but there are bigger problems believe it or not than that dysfunction even though i would argue
 that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done in the richest and most powerful country in the world
 is far more dangerous than anything that a group like isis could do because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us
  from progress  
 but there are other problems  
 and the other problems came from the fact that in washington and in many capitals right now we 're in a creativity crisis in washington  
 in think tanks where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas 
 you don 't get bold new ideas because if you offer up a bold new idea not only are you attacked on twitter but you will not get
  confirmed in a government job 
 because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate you get governments that have an us versus them mentality  tiny groups of people 
  making decisions when you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions what do you get 
  danger 
 you also have processes that become reactive to news cycles  and so the parts of the u s government that do foresight that look forward that do strategy 
  the parts in other governments that do this can 't do it because they 're reacting to the news cycle  
  nine eleven  we are still looking in the wrong direction and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon
 that are far more important
 than what we saw on nine eleven far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists  far more important even than
  instability that we 've got in some areas of the world
 that are racked by instability today in fact  
 the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms  
 they may be a reaction to bigger trends  and if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend then we 've got far bigger problems to deal with  
 and so what are those trends  well to a group like you
 the trends are apparent  
 we are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society is being rewoven if
 you saw the cover of the economist a couple of days ago it said that eighty percent of the people on the planet by the year two thousand and twenty
  would have a smartphone  
 they would have a small computer connected to the internet in their pocket  
 in most of africa the cell phone penetration rate is eighty percent 
 we passed the point last october when there were more mobile cellular devices sim cards 
 out in the world than there were people  
 we are within years
 of a profound moment in our history
  single human being on the planet
 is going to be part of a man made system for the first time able to touch anyone else
 touch them for good touch them for ill  and the changes associated with that are changing
 the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking
  about when they 're thinking about these immediate threats  on the security side  we 've come out of a cold war in which it was
 too costly to fight a nuclear war  and so we didn 't to a period that i call cool war cyber war 
 where the costs of conflict are actually so low that we may never stop 
 we may enter a period of constant warfare
  we know this because we 've been in it for several years and yet  we don 't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard  
 we don 't have the basic ideas formulated if someone attacks us with a cyber attack do have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack  
 we don 't know if somebody launches a cyber attack how do we deter them when
  china launched a series of cyber attacks what did the u s government do it said we 're going to indict a few of these chinese guys 
 who are never coming to america they 're never going to be anywhere near
 a law enforcement officer who 's going to take them into custody  it 's a gesture it 's not a deterrent  
 special forces operators out there in the field today discover
  that small groups of insurgents with cell phones have access to satellite imagery
 that once only superpowers had 
 in fact  if you 've got a cell phone you 've got access to power that a superpower didn 't have and would have highly classified ten years ago in my cell phone i have an app that tells me where every plane
 plane in the world is  and its altitude  and its speed and what kind of aircraft it is and where it 's going and where it 's landing  
 they have apps that allow them to know what their adversary is about to do they 're using these tools in new ways 
 when a cafe in sydney was taken over by a terrorist he went in with a rifle  
  because he captured people he terrorized them he pointed the ipad at them 
 and then he took the video and he put it on the internet and he took over the world 's media  
 but it doesn 't just affect the security side  the relations between great powers we thought we were past
  the bipolar era we thought we were in a unipolar world where all the big issues were resolved remember  it was the end of history  
 but we 're not we
 're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the internet that it was going to connect us weave society together
 are not necessarily true  
 in countries like china you have the great firewall of china  you 've got countries saying no if the internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders we control the
  content  we are going to control our security we are going to manage that internet we are going to say what can be on it we 're going to set a different set of rules now you might think well that 's just china  
 but it 's not just china  
 it 's china  india  russia  it 's saudi arabia  it 's singapore it 's brazil after the nsa
  the indians the brazilians they said let 's create a new internet backbone  because we can 't be dependent on this other one  and so all of a sudden what do you have 
 you have a new bipolar world in which 
 our belief is challenged by 
 another belief  we are seeing these changes everywhere
  we are seeing the advent of mobile money  it 's happening in the places you wouldn 't expect it 's happening in kenya and tanzania  
 where millions of people who haven 't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones 
 there are two point five million people who don 't have financial service access that are going to get it soon 
 a billion of them are going to have the ability to access it on their cell
 phone soon it 's not just going to give them the ability to bank  it 's going to change what monetary policy is  it 's going to change what money is  
 education is changing in the same way  
 healthcare is changing in the same way  how government services are delivered is changing in the same way  
 and yet  in washington  we are debating whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over syria and iraq
 isis or isil or islamic state  we are trying to determine
 how much we want to give in a negotiation with the iranians on a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of fifty years ago  
 when in fact we know
  that the iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us and we 're ignoring it partially because businesses are not
 willing to talk about the attacks that are being waged on them  and that gets us to
 another breakdown that 's crucial and another breakdown that couldn 't be more important to a group like this 
 because the growth of america and real american national security and all of the things that drove progress
 even during the cold war
 partnership between science technology and government
 that began when thomas jefferson sat alone in his laboratory inventing new things  
 but it was the canals and railroads and telegraph it was radar and the internet it was tang the breakfast drink
  probably not the most important of those developments 
 but what you had was a partnership and a dialogue and the dialogue has broken down  it 's broken down because in washington  
 less government is considered more it 's broken down because there is  believe it or not in washington a war on science despite the fact that in all of human history  every time anyone has waged a war on science science has won
  have a government that doesn 't want to listen that doesn 't have people at the highest levels that understand this in the nuclear age when there were people in senior national security jobs  
 they were expected to speak throw weight 
 they were expected to know the lingo the vocabulary  if you went to the highest level of the u s government now and said talk to me about cyber
 about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow you 'd get a blank stare i know because when i wrote this book i talked to one hundred and fifty people many from the science and tech side who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids ' table 
 meanwhile on the tech side  we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things but they started
  in garages and they didn 't need the government and they don 't want the government many of them have a political view that 's somewhere between libertarian and anarchic  leave me alone  
 but the world 's coming apart 
 all of a sudden there are going to be massive regulatory changes and massive issues associated with conflict and massive issues associated with security and 
  privacy  and we haven 't even gotten to the next set of issues which are philosophical issues  
  can 't vote if you can 't have a job if you can 't bank if you can 't get health care if you can 't be educated without internet access is internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions 
 if internet access is a fundamental right 
 is electricity access for the one point two billion who don 't have access to electricity a fundamental right these are fundamental issues
  the dialogue  and that brings me to the reason that i 'm here i live in washington  pity me 
 the dialogue isn 't happening there 
 these big issues that will change the world change national security change economics create hope  create
  only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government both sides need each other 
 and until we recreate that connection  
 until we do what helped america grow and helped other countries grow  then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable 
  the risks associated with nine eleven will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent they
 'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues
 and our inability to get together
 scientists  technologists government leaders at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the renaissance
  akin to the beginning of the the major transformational eras that have happened on earth  
 and start coming up with if not the right answers then at least the right questions  we are not there yet  
 but discussions like this and groups like you are the places where those questions can be formulated and posed  and that 's why i believe
  that groups like ted  
 discussions like this around the planet are the place where the future of foreign policy of economic policy of social policy of philosophy  will ultimately take place  
 and that 's why it 's been a pleasure speaking to you  thank you very very
