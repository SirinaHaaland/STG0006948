  to you lexicography the practice of compiling dictionaries  notice we 're very specific that word
  dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite out of a lump of rock it 's made up of lots of little bits it 's little discrete that 's spelled 
 bits  
 and those bits are words  now one of the perks of being a lexicographer besides getting to come to ted is that you get to say really fun
  lexicographical has this great pattern it 's called a double dactyl and just by saying double dactyl i 've sent the geek needle all the way into the red but 
 lexicographical is the same pattern as higgledy piggledy right it 's a fun word to say and i get to say it a lot 
 now one of the non perks of being a lexicographer is that people don 't usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly
  what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this 
 just to let you know i do not have a lexicographical whistle but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left hand turn into the dictionary  
 and keep the bad words out  
 but the thing is i don 't want to be a traffic cop for one thing i just do not do uniforms and for another
  deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy  and it 's not very fun  
 and when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them  
 so
 if i had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work i would much rather be a
  i want to throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of english and see what marvelous creatures i can drag up from the bottom 
 but why do people want me to direct traffic when i would much rather go fishing  well  i blame the queen
  why do i blame the queen well first of all i blame the queen because it 's funny but secondly  i blame the queen because
 dictionaries have really not changed our
 idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign 
 the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f word which has happened in american dictionaries since 
 so there 's this guy right victorian era james murray  first editor of the oxford english dictionary  i do not have that hat  i wish i had that hat  
 so he 's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today when a guy who looks like that in that hat
  is the face of modernity you have a problem  
 and so  james murray could get a job on any dictionary today  
 there 'd be virtually no learning curve and of course a few of us are saying okay computers computers what about computers the
 thing about computers is  i love computers  i mean i 'm a huge geek i love computers  i would go on a hunger strike before i let them take away google book search from me
  computers don 't
 do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries  they don 't change the end result  
 because what a dictionary is is it 's victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion  it 's steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede
  we have victorian design with an engine on it that 's all the design has not changed  
 and ok what about online dictionaries right online dictionaries must be different 
 this is the oxford english dictionary online one of the best online dictionaries this is my favorite word by the way erinaceous 
 pertaining to the hedgehog family of the nature of a hedgehog very useful word 
 so look at that online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen
  is flat look how many links there are in the actual entry two right 
 those little buttons i had them all expanded except for the date chart so there 's not very much going on here there 's not a lot of clickiness 
 and in fact online dictionaries
 replicate almost all the problems of print  except for searchability  
 and when you improve searchability you actually take away the one advantage of print which is serendipity serendipity is when you
  things you weren 't looking for because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult so 
 now when you think about this what we have here
 is a ham butt problem  does everyone know the ham butt problem  woman 's making a ham for a big family dinner she
  goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she looks at this piece of ham and she 's like this is a perfectly good piece of ham why am i throwing this away she thought well 
 my mom always did this so she calls up mom and she says mom why 'd you cut the butt off the ham when you 're making a ham she says i don 't know my mom always did it so they call grandma  and grandma says my pan was too small 
 so  it 's not that we have good words and bad words  we have a pan that 's too small
 you know that ham butt is delicious there 's no reason to throw it away the bad words
  see when people think about a place and they don 't find a place on the map  they think this map sucks 
 when they find a nightspot or a bar and it 's not in the guidebook they 're like ooh this place must be cool it 's not in the guidebook 
 when they find a word that 's not in the dictionary they think this must be a bad word 
 why it 's more likely to be a bad dictionary why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan 
  you can 't get a smaller ham the english language is as big as it is so if you have a ham butt problem and you 're thinking about the ham butt problem  
 the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive 
 paper is the enemy of words  
 how can this be i mean i love books  i really love books some of my best
  there will still be paper dictionaries  when we had cars when cars became the dominant mode of transportation we didn 't round up all the horses and shoot them you
 know there 're still going to be paper dictionaries but it 's not going to be the dominant
  dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in and
 it 's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in so think about it this way  
 if
 you 've got an artificial constraint artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview 
 what if biologists could only study animals that
  what if we made aesthetic judgments about animals and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study 
 we 'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna  and not very much
 about much else  and i think this is a problem i think we should study all the words because
 when you think about words  you can make beautiful expressions
  from very humble parts  lexicography is really more about material science we are studying the tolerances
 of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression your speeches and your writing  
 and then often people say to me well  ok  how do i know that this word is real 
  if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers  
 how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball peen hammer 
 they 're just the right tools for the job and so people say to me how do i know if a word is real you know
 anybody who 's read a children 's book
 knows that love makes things real  if you love a word
  use it that makes it real 
 being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction it doesn 't make a word any more real than  any other way  
 if you love a word  it becomes real  
 so if we 're not worrying about directing traffic  if we 've transcended paper 
 if we
 are worrying less about control and more about description
 then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile 
 and any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes is touched any time you touch a word  you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it 
 you make the mobile move  you didn 't break it it 's just in a new position and that new position
 can be just as beautiful now
  if you 're no longer a traffic cop the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection or the cars get confused  right
  but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic but maybe to count the cars that go by 
 then more eyeballs are better  you can ask for help  if you ask for help  
 you get more done  and we really need help  library of congress
  million books of which half are in english if only one out of every ten of those books had a word that 's not in the dictionary in it 
 that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries  and i find an
  point one million newspaper pages  if only one in one hundred of those pages had an un dictionaried word on it it would be an entire other
  that 's five hundred thousand more words  so that 's a lot and i 'm not even talking about
  talking about blogs and i find more new words on boingboing in a given week than i do newsweek or time 
 there 's a lot going on there and i 'm not even talking about polysemy  which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves
 so if you think of the word set a set can be a badger 's burrow a set can be one of the pleats in an elizabethan ruff  and there 's one numbered definition in the
  little word thirty three numbered definitions one of them is just labeled miscellaneous technical senses 
 do you know what that says to me that says to me it was friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub 
 that 's a lexicographical cop out to say miscellaneous technical senses so we have
  words and we really need help  and the thing is we could ask for help asking for help 's not that hard
  i mean  lexicography is not rocket science see  i just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers  and this is more of a visual explanation if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language 
 these bright spots are what we know about and the dark spots are where we are in the dark if that was the map of all the words in american english 
 we don 't know very
  and we don 't even know the shape of the language 
 if this was the dictionary if this was the map of american english look we have a kind of lumpy idea of florida  but there 's no california we 're missing california
 from american english we just don 't know enough  and we don 't even know that we 're missing california we don 't even see  that there 's a gap on the map so
 again lexicography is not rocket science  but even if it were rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs
  these days you know 
 it can 't be that hard to find some words  
 so  enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help and they 're doing a good job of it 
 for instance there 's ebird where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings and then ornithologists can go and help track
  and there 's this guy mike oates mike oates lives in the u k he 's a director of an electroplating company he 's found more than one hundred and forty comets 
 he 's found so many comets they named a comet after him  it 's kind of out past mars it 's a hike i don 't think he 's getting his picture taken there anytime soon  but he found one hundred and forty comets without a telescope  
 he downloaded data from the nasa soho satellite and that 's how he found them if we can find comets without a telescope
 shouldn 't we be able to find words  
 now y 'all know where i 'm going with this because i 'm going to the internet which is where everybody goes and the internet is great for collecting words because the internet 's full of collectors  
 and this is a little known technological fact about the internet but the internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm 
 and
 words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography
 so
 there are a lot of really good word collecting sites out there right now but the problem with some of them is that they 're not scientific enough they show the word but they don 't show any context where did it come from who said it 
 what newspaper was it in what book because a word is like an
 an archaeological artifact  if you don 't know the provenance or the source of the artifact
  it 's not science  it 's a pretty thing to look at 
 so a word without its source is like a cut flower  you know it 's pretty to look at for a while but then it dies it dies too fast  
 so  
 this whole time i 've been saying the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary not a dictionary or dictionaries and that 's because well people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language they use it synecdochically  
 and one of the problems of knowing a word like synecdochically is that you really want an excuse
  this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say synecdochically to all of you so i 'm really sorry  but when you use a part of something like the dictionary is a part of the language or a flag stands for the united states it 's a symbol of the country
 then you 're using it synecdochically  but
 the thing is we could make the dictionary the whole language  if we get a bigger
  pan then we can put all the words in we can put in
 all the meanings doesn 't everyone want more meaning in their lives 
 and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language we can make it be the whole language
  we can put in all the
