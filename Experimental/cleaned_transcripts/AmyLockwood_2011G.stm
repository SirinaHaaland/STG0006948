  i am a reformed marketer  and i now work in international development 
 in october i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo  which is the [ second ] largest country in africa in fact it 's as large as western europe 
  but it only has three hundred miles of paved roads 
 the drc is a dangerous place in the past ten years five million people have died due to a war in the east 
 but war isn 't the only reason that life is difficult in the drc 
 there are many health issues as well 
 in fact the hiv prevalence rate is one point three percent among adults this might not sound like a large number  but in a
  million people it means there are nine hundred and thirty thousand that are infected  
 and due to the poor infrastructure only twenty five percent of those are receiving the life saving drugs that they need  
 which is why in part donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost  
 and so while i was in the drc i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms  
 including damien 
 damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa it 's a hotel that 's only open
  until midnight so it 's not a place that you stay  but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come 
 now damien knows all about condoms  but he doesn 't sell them he said there 's just not in demand  
 it 's not surprising  because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms  
 joseph and christine who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms said
 despite the fact that donor agencies
  provide them at low or no cost  and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them 
 their customers don 't buy the branded versions they like the generics  
 and as a marketer i found that curious  and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like 
 and it turns out that there are three main messages used
  they name the condoms things like vive to live or trust 
 they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv  put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them  
 show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or
  to act prudently now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom 
 what is it that you think about just before you get a condom 
 sex  
 and the private companies that sell condoms in these places  they understand this their marketing is slightly different 
 the name might not be much different  but the imagery sure is
  some brands are aspirational
  and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative  
 and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing understanding
 who 's the audience and for donor agencies unfortunately the audience tends to be people that aren 't even in the country they 're working
  's people back home people that support their work people like these 
 but if what we 're really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv we need to think about the customer 
 the people whose behavior needs to change
 the couples the young women the young men whose lives depend on it and so the lesson is
  this it doesn 't really matter what you 're selling 
 you just have to think about who is your customer  and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior it might just save their lives  
 thank you
