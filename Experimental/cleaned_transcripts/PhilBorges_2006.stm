  a linguist said that of the six thousand languages spoken on earth
  three thousand aren 't spoken by the children so that in one generation we 're going to halve our cultural diversity 
 he went on to say that every two weeks an elder goes to the grave
 carrying the last spoken word of that culture so an entire philosophy 
 a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically
  gleaned over centuries goes away  and this happens every two weeks 
 so for the last twenty years since my dental experience i
 have been traveling the world and coming back
 with stories about some of these people
  what i 'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you  this is tamdin she is a 
 nun she was thrown in prison in tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard
 protesting the occupation of her country and when i met her she had just
 taken a walk over the himalayas from lhasa the capital of tibet into nepal  across to india
 thirty days
 to meet her leader the dalai lama the dalai lama lives in dharamsala india  so i took this picture three days after she arrived  
 and she had this beat up pair of tennis shoes on with her toes sticking out and she crossed in march  and there 's a lot of snow at eighteen thousand five hundred feet in march
  his whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising when the dalai lama had to leave
 tibet  and he was beaten starved
  tortured lost all his teeth while in prison  and when i met him he was a kind gentle old man  
 and it really impressed me i met him two weeks after he got out of prison
 that he went through that experience and ended up with the demeanor that he had  
 so i was in dharamsala meeting these people 
 and i 'd spent about five weeks there  and i was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of tibet into dharamsala
  and it just so happened on the fifth week there was a public teaching by the dalai lama 
  and i was watching this crowd of monks and nuns many of which i had just interviewed and heard their stories  
 and i watched their faces  and they gave us a
  little fm radio and we could listen to the translation of his teachings and what he said was 
 treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels because it 's your enemies
 that
 build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment 
 that hit me so hard  telling these people that had been through this
  two months later i went into
 tibet  and i started interviewing the people there taking my photographs that 's what i do i interview and do portraits  
 and this is a little girl i took her portrait up on top of the jokhang temple  
 and i 'd snuck in because it 's totally illegal to have a picture of the dalai lama in tibet it 's the quickest way you can get arrested  
 so i snuck in a bunch of little
 wallet sized pictures of the dalai lama  and i would hand them out and when i gave them to the people 
 they 'd either hold them to their heart or they 'd hold them up to their head and just stay there  and this is
 well at the time i did this ten years ago that was thirty six years after the dalai lama had left  so
 i was going in interviewing these people and doing their portraits
  is jigme and her sister sonam  and they live up on the chang tang the tibetan plateau way in the western part of the country  
 this is at seventeen thousand feet  
 and they had just come down from the high pastures at eighteen thousand feet same thing gave her a picture she held it up to her forehead  
 and i usually hand out polaroids when i do these because i 'm setting up lights and checking my lights
  lights  and when i showed her her polaroid she screamed and ran into her tent  
 this is tenzin gyatso  he was found to be the buddha of compassion at the age of two out in a peasant 's
 house  way out in the middle of nowhere at the age of four he was installed as the
  dalai lama as a teenager he faced
 the invasion of his country and had to deal with it he was the leader of the country  eight years later  when they discovered there was a plot to kill him 
 they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback and took the same trip that
 tamdin did
 and he 's never been back to his country since 
  to a severe political and human rights issue  
 and the young people young tibetans are starting to say listen this doesn 't work you know violence as a political tool is all the rage right now  
 and
 he still is holding this line
  so this is our icon to 
 in our world one of our living icons  
 this is another leader of his people this is moi this is in the ecuadorian amazon  and moi is thirty five years old  and
 this area of the ecuadorian amazon
  and in this period of time since that time
 as much oil or twice as much oil as was spilled in the exxon valdez accident 
 was spilled in this little area of the amazon and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move 
 and moi
 belongs to the huaorani tribe and they 're known as very
  they 've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil oil workers with spears and blowguns  
 and we spent i was with a team
 two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt  this was on a monkey hunt  
 hunting with curare tipped darts  and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible
 they could hear things smell things see things i couldn 't see and i couldn 't even see the monkeys that they were
 getting with these darts  this is yadira and yadira is
 five years old she 's in a tribe that 's neighboring the huaorani and her tribe has had to move three times in the
  last ten years because of the oil spills  and we never hear about that and the latest
 infraction against these people
 is 
 as part of plan colombia we 're spraying paraquat or round up whatever it is we 're defoliating thousands of acres of the ecuadorian amazon in our war on drugs 
 and these people are the people who take the brunt of it
  this is mengatoue he 's the shaman of the huaorani  and
 he said he said to us you know i 'm an older man now i 'm getting tired you know
 i 'm tired of spearing these oil workers  i wish they would just go away  
 and i was i usually travel alone when i do my work but i did this
  hosted a program for discovery  and when i went down with the team i was
 quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people especially into the huaorani  deep into the huaorani tribe and
 as it turned out these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in
  one of the things i did
 just before nine eleven august of two thousand and one
 i took my son  dax who was sixteen at the time 
 and i took him to pakistan  
 because at first i wanted you know i 've taken him on a couple of trips  but i wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less i wanted
  him to get an experience in the islamic world
 and i also wanted him to i was going there to
 work with a group do a story on a group called the kalash that are a group of animists three thousand animists that live very small area
 surrounded by islam there 's three thousand
 of these
  a great experience for him he stayed up all night with them drumming and dancing  and he brought a soccer ball and we had soccer every night in this little village 
 and then we went up and met their shaman 
 by the way mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well  and this is john doolikahn who 's the shaman of the
  and he 's up in the mountains right on the border with afghanistan in fact on that other side is the area tora bora the area where
 osama bin laden 's supposed to be this is the tribal area  and we watched and stayed with
 john doolikahn  and the shaman i did a whole series on shamanism which is
 is an interesting phenomenon  but around the world
  they go into trance in different ways and in pakistan 
 the way they do it is they burn juniper juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke  
 and they 're all praying to the mountain gods as they
  getting kids used to different realities i think is so important what dan dennett said the other day
 having a curriculum where they study different religions 
 just to make a mental flexibility give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place
  and all the security issues they they cause us so one thing we did
 five years ago we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the united states so we first hooked up a
 spot in the navajo nation with a classroom in seattle 
  this is daniel he 's one of our students in arctic village alaska  he lives in this log cabin no running
  this is
 i see this rolling out all over this is our site  in ollantaytambo peru four years ago  where they first saw their first computers now they have computers in their classrooms  
 and the way we 've
 done this we teach digital storytelling to these kids and we have them tell stories about issues
  in their community that they care about and this is in peru where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up 
 and the way we do it is we do it in workshops and we bring people who want to learn 
 digital workflow and storytelling and have them
 work with the kids 
 and just this last year we 've taken a group of teenagers in and this has worked the best so our dream is to bring teenagers together
  community service experience as well as 
  experience as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure  
 this is teaching photoshop in the tibetan children 's village in dharamsala
 we have the website where the kids all get their homepage  this is all their movies we 've got about sixty movies that these kids have made and
  're quite incredible the one i want to show you after we get them to make the movies we have a night where we show the movies to the community and this is in takaungu 
 we 've got a generator and a digital projector and we 're projecting it up against a barn and showing one of the movies that they made 
  the other thing i wanted to give indigenous people
 a voice that was one of the big motivating factors  but the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country  
 national geographic just did a roper study of eighteen to twenty six year olds
 in our country and in nine other industrialized countries it was a two million dollar study
  united states came in second to last
 in geographic knowledge seventy percent of the kids couldn 't find afghanistan or iraq on a map 
 sixty percent couldn 't find india thirty percent couldn 't find the pacific ocean  
 and this is a study that was just done a couple of years
  i 'd like to show you now in the couple of minutes i have left is a film that a student made in guatemala we just had a workshop in guatemala 
 a week before we got to the workshop a massive landslide caused by hurricane stan last october came in and buried six hundred people alive 
  in their village  and this kid lived in the village he wasn 't there at the time and this is the little movie he put together about
  about that and he hadn 't seen a computer before we did this movie we taught him photoshop and yeah  we can play it
  this is an old mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather
