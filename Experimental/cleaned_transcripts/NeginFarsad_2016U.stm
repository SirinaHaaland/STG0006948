  muslim female like all of you and i 'm also a social justice comedian something that i insist is an actual job to explain what
  let me tell you how i got here i 've performed all over the country and let me tell you america is majestic right  it 's got breathtaking nature waffle houses and diabetes as far as the eye can see it is really something
  now the american population can be broken up into three main categories there 's mostly wonderful people haters and florida  
 besides florida the most troubling category here are the haters they are a minority
 but they overcompensate by being extra
  loud they have the napoleon complex of demographics and yes some of the men do wear heels   as a social justice comedian it 's my goal to convert these haters because they hate a lot of things which 
  leads to negative outcomes like racism violence and ted nugent 
  the point is 
 we have to reckon with the haters but there 's variance within this group and it 's not efficient to go after all of them right  so what i 've done is created a highly scientific taxonomy of haters i basically took all of the haters  i put them in a petri dish like a scientist 
 and this is what i found 
 laughter first off we have the trolls these are your garden variety digital haters  they 're the people who quit their jobs so they can post on youtube videos all day long
  there 's also the
  these people will be at a stoplight they 'll wait for the light to turn green and when it does they yell go back to your own country now back in the day they would 've actually gotten out of their cars and hated you 
  to your face but they just don 't make them like they used to which is another sign of the decline in america
  these guys like to hate via a seemingly nice organization like a church or a nonprofit and they oftentimes like to speak in an old timey voice  
 but the group i 'm most interested in is the swing hater  the swing hater is sister to the swing voter they just can 't decide  they 're like ideological sluts
  who move from hating to not hating and they do it because they don 't have enough information this is the group i like to target with social justice comedy  why comedy  because on a scale 
  of comedy to brochure  the average american prefers comedy as you can see from this graph 
  why does social justice comedy work because first off it makes you laugh  and when you 're laughing you enter into a state of openness  and in that moment 
  of openness a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information and if they 're really skilled a rectal exam 
 here are some ground rules for social justice comedy  
 first off it 's not partisan this isn 't political comedy this is about justice and no one is against justice
  it 's inviting and warm it makes you feel like you 're sitting inside of a burrito three 
 it 's funny but sneaky like you could be hearing an interesting treatise on income inequality that 's encased in a really sophisticated poop joke  
 laughter here 's how i see social justice comedy working  a few years ago i rounded up a bunch of
  country to places like alabama arizona tennessee georgia places where they love the  muzzies and
 we did stand up shows we called the tour the muslims are coming 
 laughter we turned this into a movie  and then after the movie came out
  a known hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti muslim poster campaign with the mta that 's the new york city subway system
  system  now the posters were truly offensive not to mentioned poorly designed i mean if you 're going to be bigoted you might as well use a better font but
 we decided why not launch our own poster campaign that says nice things about muslims while promoting the movie so myself and fellow comedian dean obeidallah decided to launch the
  we raised the money worked with the  mta for over five months got the posters approved and two days after they were supposed to go up 
 the mta decided to ban the posters citing political content let 's take a look at a couple of those posters here 's one
  facts about muslims muslims invented the concept of a hospital ok  fact grown up muslims
  let 's take a look at another one  the ugly truth about muslims they have great frittata recipes  
 now clearly frittatas are considered political by the mta either that or the mere mention of muslims in a positive light was considered political but it isn 't it 's about justice  so
  what i 'm saying is a couple of dirt bag comedians took on a major new york city agency and the comedians won thank you 
 victory was a very weird feeling i was like is this what blonde girls feel like all
  i 'm asked everywhere i go why don 't muslims denounce terrorism we do but ok i 'll take the bait so i decided to launch 
 it 's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week while taking the weekends off let 's take a look
 at an example they generally appear as  single panel
 cartoons i denounce terrorism i also denounce people who never fill the paper tray the point of the website is that it
  denounces terrorism while recognizing that it 's ridiculous that we have to constantly denounce terrorism  
 but if bigotry isn 't your thing social justice comedy is useful for all sorts of issues for example  myself and fellow comedian lee camp went to the cayman islands to investigate offshore banking  
 now  the united states
 something like three hundred billion dollars a year in these offshore tax havens not to brag but at the end of every month i have something like 5 15 dollars in disposable income 
 so we walked into these banks in the cayman islands and asked if we could open up a bank account with eight dollars and twenty seven cents 
 laughter the bank managers would indulge us for 30 45 seconds before calling security security would come
 brandish their weapons  and then we would squeal with fear and run away because and this is the last rule of social justice comedy sometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants 
 most of my work is meant to be fun it 's meant to generate a connection and laughter  but yes sometimes i get run off the grounds by security  sometimes 
  i get mean tweets and hate mail sometimes i get voice mails saying that if i continue
  'll kill me and they 'll kill my family  and those death threats are definitely not funny 
 but despite the occasional danger i still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons  i mean  we 've tried a lot of approaches to social justice like war and competitive ice dancing but still 
 a lot of things are still kind of awful so i think it 's time we try and tell a really good poop joke  
 thank you
