  this happy pic of me was taken in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine i was a senior in college and it was right after a dance practice  i was really really happy  
 and i remember exactly where i was about a week and
  i was sitting in the back of my used minivan in a campus parking lot  when i decided i was going to commit suicide 
 i went from deciding to  full blown planning very quickly  
 and i came this close to the edge of the precipice it 's the closest i 've ever come  
 and the only reason i took my finger off the trigger
 was thanks to a few lucky
  after the fact  that 's what scared me the most the element of chance  
 so i became very methodical about testing different ways that i could manage my ups and downs  which has proven to be a good investment 
 many normal people might have say  six to ten major depressive episodes in their lives i have bipolar depression it runs in my family  i 've had 
 at this point  and i 've learned a lot
 many rounds in the ring with darkness taking good notes  
 so i thought rather than get up and give any type of recipe for success or highlight reel  i would share my recipe for avoiding self destruction 
 and certainly 
 and the tool i 've found which has proven to be the most reliable safety net for emotional free fall is actually
 the same tool that has helped me to make my best business decisions but that is secondary  
 and it is stoicism  that sounds boring you
 might think of spock or it might conjure and image
 like this a cow standing in the rain it 's not
  's not particularly happy it 's just an impassive creature taking whatever life sends its way  
 you might not think of the ultimate competitor  say bill belichick head coach of the new england patriots who
 has the all time nfl record for super bowl titles  and stoicism has spread like wildfire in the top of the nfl ranks as a means of mental toughness training in the last few years
  might not think of
 the founding fathers thomas jefferson john adams  george washington to name but three students of stoicism  
 george washington actually had a play about a stoic
 this was cato a tragedy performed for his troops at valley forge to keep them motivated  
 so why would people of action focus so much on an ancient philosophy this seems very
  i would encourage you to think about stoicism a little bit differently as an operating system for thriving in high stress environments for making better decisions  
 and it all started
 here  kind of on a porch  so around three hundred bc
 in athens  someone named zeno of citium taught many lectures walking around a painted porch
  used stoicism as a comprehensive system for doing many many things  
 but for our purposes chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you cannot control 
 and then doing exercises to focus exclusively on the former this decreases emotional reactivity  which can be a superpower
  you miss a pass you get furious with yourself that could cost you a game if you 're
 a ceo and you fly off the handle at a very valued employee because of a minor infraction  that could cost you the employee 
 if you 're a college student who say is in a downward spiral  
 and you feel helpless and hopeless  unabated that could cost you your life so the stakes are very very high  
 and there are many tools
 in the toolkit
 to get you there i 'm going to focus on one that completely changed my life in two thousand and four 
 it found me then because of two things 
 a very close friend 
 young guy my age died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly  and then my girlfriend who i thought i was going to marry  walked out  she 'd had enough  
 and she didn 't give me a dear john letter but she did give me this
 a dear john plaque i 'm
 not making this up i 've kept it 
 business hours are over at five o 'clock she gave this to me to put on my desk for personal health because at the time  
 i was working on my first real business i had no idea what i was doing i was working 14 plus hour days seven days a week  
 i was using stimulants to get going
  i was using depressants to wind down and go to sleep it was a disaster i felt completely trapped 
 i bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers  and i did find a quote that made made a big difference in my life  which was 
 we suffer more often in imagination than in reality by seneca the younger who
 was a famous stoic writer  that took me to his letters which took me to the exercise
  means the pre meditation of evils in simple terms this is visualizing the worst case scenarios in detail 
 that you fear  preventing you from taking action so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis 
 my problem was monkey mind super loud very incessant just thinking my way through problems doesn 't work  
 i needed to capture my thoughts on paper so i created a written exercise that i called
 like goal setting for myself it consists of three pages super simple the first page is right here what if i
 this is whatever you fear whatever is causing you anxiety whatever you 're putting off it could be asking someone out  ending a relationship  asking for a
  could be anything for me it was taking my first vacation in four years
 and stepping away from my business for a month to go to london  where i could stay in a friend 's room for free 
 to either remove myself as a bottleneck in the business or shut it down 
 in the first column define you 're writing down all of the worst things you can imagine happening if you take that step 
  get depressed the whole thing will be a huge waste of time  number two i 'll miss a letter from the irs and i 'll get audited or raided or shut down or some such and
 then you go to the prevent column in that column you write down the answer to what could i do to prevent each of these bullets from happening or at the very
  decrease the likelihood even a little bit  
 so for getting depressed in london  
 i could take a portable blue light with me and use it for fifteen minutes in the morning i knew that helped stave off depressive episodes 
 for the irs bit  i could change the mailing address on file with the irs so the paperwork would go to my accountant
 instead of to my ups address  easy peasy then we go to repair so
  scenarios happen what could you do to repair the damage even a little bit or who could you ask for help so in
 the first case london well i could fork over some money  fly to spain get some sun
 undo the damage if i got into a funk 
 in the case of missing a letter from the irs i could call a friend who is a lawyer or ask say a professor of law
 what they
  who i should talk to  how had people handled this in the past 
 so one question to keep in mind as you 're doing this first page is has anyone else in the history of time less intelligent or less driven figured this out  
 chances are the answer is yes 
 the second page
 is simple what might be the benefits of an attempt or a partial success you can see we 're
  up the fears and really taking a conservative look at the upside  so if you attempted whatever you 're considering might you build confidence develop skills
 emotionally financially  otherwise what might be the benefits of say a base hit  spend ten to fifteen minutes on this page three 
 this might be the most important so don 't skip it the cost of inaction humans are very good at considering what might go
  if we try something new say ask for a raise what we don 't often consider is the atrocious cost of the status quo
 not changing anything  so you should ask yourself if i avoid this action or decision
 and actions and decisions like it what might my life look like
 in say  six months  twelve months three years any further out it starts to seem intangible and really get detailed again
  emotionally financially  physically whatever and when i did this it painted a terrifying picture
 my business was going to implode at any moment at all times if i didn 't step away my relationships were fraying or failing  
 and i realized that inaction was no longer an option for me 
 those are the three pages that
  realized that on a scale of one to ten one being minimal impact ten being maximal impact 
 if i took the trip i was risking a one to three of temporary and reversible pain for an eight to ten of positive life changing impact that could be a semi permanent 
 so i took the trip  none of the disasters came to pass there were some hiccups sure  i was able to extricate myself from the business
  i ended up extending that trip for a year and a half around the world 
 and that became the basis for my first book that leads me here today  and i can trace all of my biggest wins
 and all of my biggest disasters averted
 back to doing fear setting at least once a quarter it 's not a panacea you 'll find that
  but you shouldn 't conclude that without first putting them under a microscope  
 and it doesn 't make all the hard times the hard choices  easy but it can make a lot of them easier i
 'd like to close with a profile of one of my favorite modern day stoics this is jerzy  gregorek 
 he is a four time world champion in olympic weightlifting 
  he can still kick my ass and probably most asses in this room he
 's an impressive guy  i spent a lot of time on his stoa his porch  asking life and training advice  
 he was part of the solidarity in poland  which was a nonviolent movement
 for social change that was violently suppressed by the government he lost his career as a firefighter then his mentor a priest was kidnapped tortured killed and
  thrown into a river  
 he was then threatened he and his wife had to flee poland  bounce from country to country until they landed in the us with next to nothing sleeping on floors  
 he now lives in woodside california in a very nice place  
 and of the 10 000 plus people i 've met in my life  i would put him in the top ten in terms of success and happiness  
 and there 's a punchline coming  so pay attention
  him a text a few weeks ago asking him had he ever read any stoic philosophy  and he replied with two pages of text this is very unlike him  he is a terse dude 
 and not only was he familiar with stoicism but he pointed out for all of his most important decisions his inflection points  when he stood up
 for his principles and ethics  how he had used stoicism and something
  akin to fear setting which blew my mind and he closed with two things  number one he couldn 't imagine any life more beautiful than that of a stoic  
 and the last was his mantra which he applies to everything  and you can apply to everything 
 easy choices hard life 
  the hard choices what we most fear doing  asking saying
 these are very often exactly what we most need to do  
 and the biggest challenges and problems we face will never be solved with comfortable conversations  whether it 's in your own head or with other people 
 so i encourage you to ask yourselves  where in your lives right now
 might defining your
  fears be more important than defining your goals  
 keeping in mind all the while the words of seneca we suffer more often in imagination than in reality thank you very much
