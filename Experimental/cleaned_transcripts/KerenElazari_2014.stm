  four years ago a security researcher or as most people would call it a hacker 
 found a way to literally make atms throw money at him his name was barnaby jack 
  technique
 was later called jackpotting in his honor i 'm here today because i think we actually need hackers  
 barnaby jack
 could have easily turned into a career criminal or james bond villain
 with his knowledge  but he chose to show the world his research instead he believed that
  sometimes
 you have to demo a threat to spark a solution  
 and i feel the same way that 's why i 'm here today 
 we are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have they scare us  
 but the choices they make
 have dramatic outcomes that influence us all
 so i am here today because i think we need hackers  and in fact  they just might be the immune system
 for the information age  
 sometimes they make us sick  but they also find those hidden threats in our world and they make us
  i knew that i might get hacked
 for giving this talk 
 so let me save you the effort in true ted fashion here is my most embarrassing picture  
 but it would be difficult for you to find me in it  because i 'm the one who looks like a boy
 standing to the side i was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the dungeons and dragons team wouldn 't let me join
  this is who i was but this
 is who i wanted to be  
 angelina jolie  she portrayed acid burn in the ' ninety five film hackers she was pretty and she could rollerblade  
 but being a hacker 
 that made her powerful and i wanted to be just like her so i started spending a lot of time on hacker chat
  rooms and online forums  i remember one late night i found a bit of php code  i didn 't really know what it did but i 
  it and used it anyway to get into a 
  site like that open sesame
 it was a simple trick  and i was just a script kiddie back then but to me that trick  it felt like this
  like i had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips  
 this is the rush of power that hackers feel  it 's geeks just like me
 discovering they have access to superpower one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect  but thankfully no
  but with great power comes great responsibility  and you all like to think that if we had such powers we would only use them for good but
 what if you could read your ex 's emails or add a couple zeros to your bank account 
 what would you do then  
 indeed  many hackers do not resist those temptations  
 and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year
 to fraud malware or plain old identity theft which is a serious issue but there are other hackers hackers who just like to break things  
 and it is precisely those hackers
 that can find the weaker elements in our world
 and make us fix it  this is what happened last year when
  another security researcher called kyle lovett
 discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office  
 he learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers 
 no password needed  he reported it to the company of course  but they ignored his report 
 perhaps they thought universal access was a feature not a
  bug  
 until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people 's files  
 but they didn 't steal anything  they left a note  
 your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world here 's what you should do to fix it we hope we helped 
  by getting into people 's files like that yeah they broke the law  but they also forced that company to fix their product  
 making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure
 in the hacker community  
 and it is controversial but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day  
 this is what
  khalil is a palestinian hacker from the west bank  and he found a serious privacy flaw on facebook
 which he attempted to report through the company 's bug bounty program  these are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers
 disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code  unfortunately  due to some miscommunications his report was
  frustrated with the exchange he took to use his own discovery
 to post on mark zuckerberg 's wall  
 this got their attention all right  and they fixed the bug 
 but because he hadn 't reported it properly  he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries  thankfully for khalil
  group of hackers were watching out for him in fact  they raised more than thirteen thousand dollars to reward him for this discovery  
 raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing  
 but i think there 's a greater story here still 
 even companies founded by hackers like facebook
  still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers  
 and so for more conservative organizations  it is going to take time and adapting
 in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it  
 but i think it 's worth the effort  because the alternative to blindly fight all
  is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge  
 these are things that will come back and bite you 
 it is even more true
 if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom
 for ideals like the freedom of the web
 especially in times like
  like today even as governments and corporates
 fight to control the internet i find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace
 can become its voice of opposition  its last line of defense even 
 perhaps someone like anonymous the leading brand of global hacktivism 
 this universal hacker movement needs no introduction today
 but six years ago
 they were not much more than an internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and internet trolling campaigns 
 their moment of transformation
 was in early two thousand and eight when the church of scientology
 attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites
  this is when anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of internet dwellers  it turns out 
 the internet doesn 't like it when you try to remove things from it and it will react
 with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks
 and with a series of organized protests all around the world from my hometown of tel aviv to
  adelaide australia  this proved that anonymous and this idea
 can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets  
 and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world  
 since then
  they 've gone after many targets they 've uncovered corruption  abuse they 've hacked popes and politicians  
 and i think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or
 even leak sensitive documents i think that like
 robin hood  they are in the business of redistribution  but what they are after
 isn 't your money  it 's not your documents  it 's your attention
 they grab the spotlight for causes they support  
 forcing us to take note  
 acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be 
 they have been called many names from criminals to terrorists and i cannot justify
  but the ideas they fight for
 are ones that matter to us all 
 the reality is hackers can do a lot more than break things  they can bring people together  
 and if the internet doesn 't like it when you try to remove things from it just watch what happens when you try to shut the internet down 
 this took place in egypt in january two thousand and eleven
 hosni mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of cairo  
 he sent his personal troops down to egypt 's internet service providers
 and had them physically kill the switch
 on the country 's connection to the world overnight for a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented and for hackers
  made it personal 
 hackers like the telecomix group were already active on the ground  helping egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like morse code and ham radio  
 it was high season for low tech which the government couldn 't block  
 but when the net went completely
  brought in the big guns  they found european service providers that still had
  analog dial up access infrastructure they opened up three hundred of those lines for egyptians to use 
 serving slow but sweet internet connection for egyptians 
 this worked  it worked so well in fact  one guy even used it to download an episode of how i met your mother
  but while egypt 's future is still uncertain 
 when the same thing happened in syria just one year later telecomix were prepared with those internet lines 
 and anonymous they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the syrian military
 by defacing their website  but with this sort of power
 it really depends on where you stand  because one man 's hero
 can be another 's villain  
 and so the syrian electronic army is a pro assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime  
 they 've taken down multiple  high profile targets in the past
  including the associated press 's twitter account in which they posted a a message
 about an attack on the white house injuring president obama  
 this tweet was fake of course  but the resulting drop in the dow jones index that day was most certainly not 
 and a lot of people lost a lot of money  this
 sort of thing is happening all over the world right now 
 in conflicts from the crimean peninsula to latin america from europe to the united states 
 hackers are a force for social  political and military influence 
 as individuals or in groups volunteers or military conflicts there are hackers everywhere  they come from all walks of life
  and genders  i might add they are now shaping the world 's stage 
 hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century  this is because access to information
 is a critical currency of power one which governments would like to control a thing they attempt to do by setting up
 thing they need hackers for by the way  and so the establishment has long had a love hate relationship when it comes to hackers  
 because the same people who demonize hacking
 also utilize it at large  two years ago  i saw general keith alexander he 's the
  commander  
 but instead of his four star general uniform  he was wearing jeans and a t shirt 
 this was at def con the world 's largest hacker conference 
 perhaps like me general alexander didn 't see twelve thousand criminals that day in vegas 
 i think he saw untapped potential
  he was there to give a hiring pitch in this room right here he said is the talent our nation needs well 
 hackers in the back row replied then stop arresting us 
 indeed  for years hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence  
 but in light of what we know now 
 who is more watchful
 of our online
  world the rules of the game are not that clear anymore but hackers
 are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data hoarding corporates on their own playing field 
 to me that represents hope 
 for the past three decades hackers have done a lot of things but they have also impacted civil liberties
  innovation and internet freedom 
 so i think it 's time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them  because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys 
 how can they be the heroes too 
 my years in the hacker world have made me realize
 both the problem
  and the beauty
 about hackers  they just can 't see something broken in the world and leave it be they are compelled
 to either exploit it or try and change it and so they find the vulnerable aspects
 in our rapidly changing world they make us  they force us to fix things or demand
  i think we need
