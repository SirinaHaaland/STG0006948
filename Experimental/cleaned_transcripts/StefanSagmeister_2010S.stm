  the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness
 trying to see if i can actually train my mind in a particular way  like i can
  train my body so i can end up with an improved feeling of
 overall  well being then this january my mother died  and pursuing a film like that just
 seemed the last thing that was interesting to me  so in a very typical silly designer fashion  after years worth of work
  pretty much all i have to show for it are the titles for the film music
 they were still done when i was on sabbatical with my company 
 in indonesia  we can see the first part here was designed here by pigs it was a little bit too funky  
 much more fitting way fashion 
 my studio in bali was only ten minutes away from a monkey forest and monkeys of course are supposed to be the happiest of all animals 
 so we trained them to be able to do three separate words to lay out them properly you
 can see 
 there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there the serif is not really in place
  so of course  what you don 't do properly yourself is never deemed done really so this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up
 over the sayan valley
 in indonesia 
 in that year what i did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys looking at a lot of data on this subject  and
 it turns out that
 men and women report very very similar levels of happiness this is a very quick overview of all the studies that i looked at that climate 
 plays no role that if you live in the best climate in san diego in the united states or in the shittiest climate in buffalo new york 
  bucks a year in the u s any salary increase you 're going to experience will have only a tiny tiny influence on your overall well being 
 black people are just as happy as white people are 
 if you 're old or young it doesn 't really make a difference if you 're ugly or if you 're really really  good looking it makes no difference whatsoever you will adapt to it and get used to it if you have manageable
  health problems
 it doesn 't really matter  now this does matter  so now the woman on the right is actually much happier than the guy on the left
 meaning that if you have a lot of friends and you have meaningful friendships that does make a lot of difference as well as being married you are likely to be much happier than if you are single 
 a fellow ted speaker
  jonathan haidt came up with this beautiful little analogy
 between the conscious and the unconscious mind he says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant the unconscious 
 and the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do  but the elephant really has his own ideas 
 sixty two in austria  if i would have been born a hundred years earlier 
 the big decisions in my life would have been made for me meaning i would have stayed in the town that i was born in 
 i would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did  and i would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected
  very much in charge of these big decisions in our lives we live where we want to be at least in the west
 we become what we really are interested in we choose our own profession and we choose our own partners  
 and so it 's quite surprising that many of us
 let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are
  not quite aware of 
 if you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called george  when he decides on where he wants to live is it florida or north dakota 
 he goes and lives in georgia and if you look at a guy called dennis  when he decides what to become is it a
  or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher
 best chance is that he wants to become a dentist  
 and if paula decides should she marry joe or jack  somehow paul sounds the most interesting  
 and so even if we make those very important decisions
 for very silly reasons  it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia
 and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas
 who are married to paul than statistically viable 
 now i of course thought well this is
 american data and i thought well those silly americans  they get
 influenced by things that
 they 're not aware of this is just completely ridiculous
  my mom and my dad 
 karolina and karl  
 and grandmom and granddad josefine
 and josef  so i am looking still for a stephanie i 'll figure something out 
 if i make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer the easiest answer of course is
 do more of the stuff
  that i like to do and much less of the stuff that i don 't like to do for which it
 would be helpful to know what it is that i actually do like to do 
 i 'm a big list maker  so i came up with a list one of them is to think without pressure this
 is a project we 're working on right now with a very healthy deadline
  it 's a book on culture and as you can see culture is rapidly drifting around  
 doing things like i 'm doing right now traveling to cannes the example i have here is a chair that came out of the year in bali clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture 
 not being stuck behind a single computer screen all day long
  quite consciously design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques just basically to fight
 straightforward adaptation 
 being close to the content that 's the content really is close to my heart 
 this is a bus or vehicle for a charity for an ngo that wants to double the education budget in the united states
 carefully designed so by two inches it still clears highway overpasses
  overpasses  
 having
 end results things that come back from the printer well like this little business card for an animation company called sideshow on lenticular foils
  working on projects that actually have visible impacts like a book for a deceased german artist
 widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous it just came out six months ago and it 's getting unbelievable 
  traction right now in germany  and i think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest 
 technique wise and the other fifty percent would be new so in this case it 's an outside projection for singapore on these giant times  square like screens  
 and i of course knew stuff as a designer about typography  
 even though we worked with those animals not so successfully  but i didn 't quite know all that much
  from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project  but also because the content was very close in this case keeping a diary supports personal 
  been keeping a diary since i was twelve  and i 've found that it influenced my life and work
 in a very intriguing way  in this case also because it
  one of the many sentiments that we build the whole series
 on that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary thank you so much
