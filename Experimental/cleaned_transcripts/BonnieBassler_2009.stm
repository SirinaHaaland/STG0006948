  bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they 've been here for billions of years  and what they are are 
 microscopic organisms  so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna they have very few genes and genetic information to encode
  all of the traits that they carry out 
 and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size  they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes two 
  and so on and so on  they just grow and divide and grow and divide so a kind of boring life  except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing
  interaction with these critters  
 i know you guys think of yourself as humans  and this is sort of how i think of you this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells 
  that make up your body  there is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have ten trillion bacterial cells in 
  you or on you at any moment in your life so ten times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being 
  dna that counts so here 's all the a t  gs and cs that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics you have about thirty thousand genes well it turns out you have one hundred times 
  more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life   at the best you 're ten percent human but more likely about one percent human
 depending on which of these metrics you like i know you think of yourself as human beings but i think of you as ninety or  ninety nine percent bacterial laughter
 these bacteria are not passive riders these are incredibly important  they keep us alive  they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps 
  environmental insults out so that we stay healthy  they digest our food  they make our vitamins  they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing
  things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive  and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well 
 so there 's all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are  they make you incredibly sick 
  and so the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do  the question we had is how could they do anything at all i mean they 're incredibly 
  small you have to have a microscope to see one  they live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they 've always been
  't be a different way that bacteria live the clue to this came from another marine bacterium and it 's a bacterium called vibrio fischeri  what you 're looking at on 
  this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean  named vibrio fischeri
  this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light  we 're not doing anything to the cells here  we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room  and this is what we see 
 what was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension  they made no
  but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously  the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms  tell 
  the difference from times when they 're alone and times when they 're in a community  and then all do something together 
 do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles  and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light 
 but when the bacteria grow and double and they 're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number and when the molecule hits a certain
  amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony  that 's how bioluminescence works they 're talking with these chemical words 
 the reason that vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology again another plug for the
 animals in the ocean vibrio
 fischeri lives in this squid what you are looking at is the hawaiian bobtail squid and it 's been turned on its back and what i hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these 
  house the vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they 're making light
  is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps  but then at night it has to come out to hunt  on bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that 
  light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it 's just in those couple feet of water 
 specialized light organ housing the bacteria then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter
  so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squid 's back so the squid doesn 't make a shadow it actually uses the light 
  from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device so predators can 't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it this is like the stealth
  bomber of the ocean 
 but then if you think about it the squid has this terrible problem because it 's got this dying thick culture of bacteria and it can 't sustain that 
 and so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it 's got a pump that 's attached to its circadian rhythm  and when the sun comes up it
  percent of the bacteria now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they 're not making light but of course the squid doesn 't care it 's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by 
  the bacteria double they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it
  cell is that vibrio fischeri has a protein that 's the red box it 's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle  and then as the cells grow they 're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there 's lots of molecule there  
 and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule
  these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor 
  and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light
 can talk to each other  they make chemical words  they recognize those words  and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison 
  we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing  they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote 
  what 's important for today 's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that 's probably the most important to you is virulence
 it 's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins you 're enormous that would have no effect on you you 're huge  what they do we now understand is they get in you they wait they start growing they count themselves with
  and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing 
 that 's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules these were the red triangles on my slides before this is the vibrio fischeri molecule
  this is the word that it talks with  so then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we 've discovered  what i hope you can see is that the molecules are related 
 the  left hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria  but the right hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species  what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities
  each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for intraspecies communication 
 each bacteria uses a particular molecule that 's its language that allows it to count its own siblings 
  what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don 't live by themselves  they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that 's depicted on this slide 
 this is your skin  so this is just a picture a micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what i hope you can see is that there  's all kinds of bacteria there  
  in bacteria and it 's about counting your neighbors it 's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population  
 so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we 've found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual they all have a 
  system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we 've discovered that 's generic so they have a
  second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria  it 's used by all different bacteria and it 's the language of interspecies communication 
 what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you they take that information
  and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who 's in the minority and who 's in the majority of any given population 
 then again we turn to chemistry  
 and we figured out what this generic molecule is that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it 's a very small five carbon molecule what the important thing is that 
  we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule  so they 're all using this molecule for interspecies
  communication  this is the bacterial esperanto 
 laughter once we got that far we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well
 i 've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors they communicate with these molecules
  of course i 've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing  we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can 't talk or they can 't hear 
 couldn 't these be new kinds of antibiotics of course you 've just heard and you already know that we 're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly 
  right now and that 's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria
  they either pop the bacterial membrane they make the bacterium so it can 't replicate its dna  we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants  and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases
 we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can 't talk they can 't count and they don 't know to launch virulence  and so that 's exactly what we 've done and we 've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we 've targeted the
  intraspecies communication system  so we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they 're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and 
  they jam recognition of the real thing by targeting the red system  what we are able to do is to make 
  sensing molecules we 've also done the same thing with the pink system  we 've taken that universal molecule and and turned it around a little bit so that we 've made antagonists of the interspecies 
  communication system  the hope is that these will be used as broad spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria
  it doesn 't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 
  're going to launch their attack and the animal dies  what we 've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our  anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they 're a little bit different which i 've depicted on this
  slide  what we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium a 
  pathogenic bacterium
 in the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives  we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it 's going 
  to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance what i hope you think is that bacteria can talk to each other they
  chemicals as their words  they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we 're just now starting to learn about
 of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular
  so in the spirit of ted they 're doing things together because it makes a difference  what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors  and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if
  they simply acted as individuals
 what i would hope that i could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria have been on the earth for billions of years humans 
 couple hundred thousand we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works
 we think by studying bacteria we 're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body  we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive 
  organisms  the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well 
  but i think about the molecular stuff  this is exactly what happens in your body  it 's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day and that 's because there 's all of this chemistry going on 
 these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be again we think that bacteria invented that and you 've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study
 the final thing is again just to reiterate that there 's this practical part and so we 've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics  but then to 
  finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we 've also made pro quorum sensing molecules so we 've targeted those systems to make the molecules
  remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in you or on you keeping you healthy  what we 're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live 
  as mutualists with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better  so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own 
  picture i hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural 
  world it was done by a child science is done by that demographic all of those people are between twenty and thirty years old and they are the engine that drives
  scientific discovery in this country  it 's a really lucky demographic to work with i keep getting older and older and they 're always the same age  and it 's just a crazy delightful 
  job i want to thank you for inviting me here it 's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference
