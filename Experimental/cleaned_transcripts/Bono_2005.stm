  alexander graham bell famously said on his first successful telephone call hello is that domino 's pizza
  another famous man jerry garcia said what a strange  long trip and he
 should have said what a strange long trip it 's about to become at this very moment  you are viewing my upper half
  my lower half is appearing at a different conference
  turns out be in two places at once but still i 'm sorry i can 't be with you in person i 'll explain at another
 time and though i 'm a rock star i just want to assure you that none of my wishes
 will include a hot tub  but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on
 this revolution is much bigger than that i hope i believe what turns me on
 about the digital age what excites me personally is that you have closed the gap
 between dreaming
 and doing you see it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song  you needed a studio and a producer
  you need a laptop   if you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of
 mass of equipment and a hollywood budget  now  you need a camera that fits in your palm 
 and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination
 has been decoupled from the old constraints  and that really really excites me
  i 'm excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking
 writ large what i would like to see is idealism decoupled
 idealism
 decoupled from all constraints political economic
 psychological whatever  the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world  from the ease
 with which you swept away obstacles
  that no one knew could even be budged  and that 's actually what i 'd like to talk about today 
 first though i should probably explain why  and how i got to this place  
 it 's a journey that started
  do they know it 's christmas 
 band aid live aid 
 another very tall 
 grizzled rock star my friend sir bob geldof issued a challenge to feed the world 
 it was a great moment  and it utterly changed my life 
  and myself went to ethiopia
  we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on we lived in ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage 
 the children had a name for me they called me the girl with the beard
  continent beautiful royal people  anybody who ever gave anything
 to africa got a lot more back ethiopia didn 't just
 blow my mind  it opened my mind  anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his
  would you take
 my son with you  he knew in ireland  that his son would live  
 and that in ethiopia his son would die  it was the middle of that awful famine 
 well  i turned him down  and
  a funny kind of sick feeling  but i turned him down and it 's a feeling i can 't ever quite forget 
 and in that moment  i started this journey 
 in that moment  i became
 the worst thing of all i became a rock star with a cause 
 laughter except this isn 't the cause  is it
  thousand africans dying every single day from aids a preventable treatable disease
 for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy that
 's not a cause 
 that 's an emergency  eleven million aids orphans in africa twenty million by the end of the decade that 's not a cause that
 's an emergency  today every day nine thousand more africans will catch hiv because of
  stigmatization and lack of education  that 's not a cause that 's an emergency  
 so what we 're talking about here is
 human rights  the right to live like a human 
 the right to live period and what we 're facing in africa is
 an unprecedented threat to human dignity
  equality  the next thing i 'd like to be clear about is what this problem is  
 and what this problem isn 't because this is not all about charity  
 this is about justice really this is not about charity  this is about justice 
  and that 's too bad because
 we 're very good at charity  
 americans like irish people are good at it  
 even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to the tsunami
 it 's inspiring  but justice
 is a tougher standard than charity  you see 
  africa makes a fool of our idea of justice  it makes a farce of our idea of equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern 
 it questions our commitment 
 because there is no way
 we can look at what 's happening in africa and if we 're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else 
 as you heard in the film  anywhere else not here  
 not here  not in america  not in europe 
 in fact
  a head of state
 that you 're all familiar with
 admitted this to me and it 's really true there is no chance
 this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa  africa is a continent
  and deep down if we really accepted that africans were equal to us  we would all do more to put the fire out we 're standing around with watering cans when
 what we really need is the fire brigade  you see it 's not as dramatic
 as the tsunami 
 it 's crazy really when you think about it does stuff have to look like an action movie these days
 to exist in the front of our brain the slow extinguishing
 countless lives is just not dramatic enough it would appear  catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones
 we could avert funny that anyway i believe
 that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual
  people dying a day in africa
 may be africa 's crisis but the fact that it 's not on the nightly news that we in europe or you in america are not treating it like an emergency
 i want to argue with you tonight that that 's our crisis  i want to argue that though africa is not the front line
 in the war against terror  it could be soon every week
  extremists take another african village they 're attempting to bring order to chaos well why aren
 poverty breeds despair we know this despair breeds violence we know this in turbulent times  isn 't it cheaper
  and smarter to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later 
 the war against
 terror is bound up
 in the war against poverty 
 and i didn 't say that 
 colin powell said that 
 now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone maybe we should listen
 there 's an opportunity here
  and it 's real it 's not spin it 's not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world
 a chance to re describe ourselves
 to the world  
 we will not only transform other people 's lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart
 in these nervous dangerous times  don 't you think that on a purely commercial level
  drugs are great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology doesn 't compassion look well on us  and let 's cut the
 the crap for a for a second in certain quarters of the world  brand eu brand usa 
 is not at its shiniest  
 the neon sign is fizzing and cracking
 someone 's put a brick through the window  the regional branch managers are getting nervous  never before
 have we in the west been so scrutinized our values do we have any our credibility 
 these things are under attack around the world  brand usa
 could use some polishing and i say that as a fan you know
 as a person who buys the products  but think about it  more
 make sense but that 's just the easy part  or ought to be but equality for africa
 that 's a big expensive idea  
  the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on earth
 can we all do about this 
 well much more than we think we can 't fix every problem but the ones we can i want to argue we must  and because we can 
 we must 
 this is the straight
 truth  the righteous truth it is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation
 that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye 
 look across the ocean to africa  and say this and mean it  
 we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written off we do not have to stand for this
  let me say this without a trace of irony
 before i back it up to a bunch of ex hippies forget the ' 60s 
 we can change the world  i can 't you can 't as individuals  but we
  change the world  i really believe that the people in this room look at the gates foundation they 've done incredible stuff  unbelievable stuff  but working together 
 we can actually change the world  we can turn
 the inevitable outcomes  and transform
 the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us
  i 'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in 
 but i want to argue that this is the moment
 that you are designed for it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier  headier
  ideas that you gestated in your youth this is what excites me this room
 was born for this moment is really what i want to say to you tonight  most of you started out wanting to change the world didn 't you 
 most of you did the digital world  well now actually because of you it is possible to change the
  they know much more than i do so
 why then are we not pumping our fists
 into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we 've got to do something about
 it it is a pain in the arse this equality business is actually a pain in the arse
  but for the first time in history  we have the technology  we have the know how we have the cash  we have the life saving drugs 
 do we have the will i hope this is obvious  but i
 'm not a hippie  and
 i 'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling  i do not have flowers in my hair
  actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not sandals
  but i know toughness when i see it 
 and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle
 to the movement that started out here  you see idealism detached from action is
  just a dream  but idealism
 allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit 
 is very exciting it 's very real it 's very strong  and it 's very present
 in a crowd like you 
 last year at data  this organization i helped set up
  we launched a campaign to summon this spirit
 in the fight against aids and extreme poverty we 're calling it the one campaign  it 's based on our belief
 that the action of one person can change a lot  but the actions of many coming together as one can change
  we feel that now is the time
 to prove we 're right there are moments in history
 when civilization redefines itself  we believe this is one  we believe that this could be the time
 when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in africa is just no longer acceptable 
 this could be the time that we finally get serious
 about changing the future
  for most people
 who live
 on planet earth momentum has been building  
 lurching a little but it 's building  this year is a test for us all especially the
 the leaders of the g8 nations who really are on the line here with all the world in history watching 
 i have been of late disappointed with the bush
  administration
 they started out with such promise on africa  they made some really great promises 
 and actually have fulfilled a lot of them but some of them
 they haven 't they don 't feel the push from the ground is the truth 
 but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american
  people and i hear their worries about the deficit and the fiscal well being of their country i understand that  but there 's much more push from the ground
 than you 'd think if we got organized what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that
 aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it
  it in the in the crassest possible terms  
 the investment reaps huge returns not only in lives saved but
 in goodwill stability and security
 that we 'll gain 
 so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold  and not have it deducted from my
  my number of wishes  what i hope
 is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians
 to do right by africa  
 by america and by the world  give them permission  if you like to spend their political capital and your financial capital
  national purse on saving the lives of millions of people that 's really what what i would like you to do because
 we also need your intellectual capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity 
 and you at this conference are in a unique position some of the
  we 've been talking about you invented them or at least revolutionized the way that they 're used 
 together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital 
 and pushed
 pushed the boundaries and we 'd like you to
 give us that energy give us that kind of dreaming that kind of doing  as i say there 're two things on the line here there 's the
  but there 's also our sense of ourselves 
 people are starting to figure this out movements are springing up  artists politicians pop stars priests  ceos  ngos mothers ' unions student unions 
 a lot of people are getting together and working
 under this umbrella i told you about earlier the one campaign
  i think they just have one idea
 in their mind which is where you live in the world
 should not determine whether you live in the world history 
 like god is watching what we do when the history books
  i think our age will be remembered for three things really it 's just three things
 this whole age will be remembered for the digital revolution  yes  the war against terror  yes  
 and what we did
 or did not do to put out the fires in africa  some say we can 't afford to 
  the ones that ted has offered to grant  
 you see if this is true and i believe it is
  the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination
 from the physical constraints of matter  this should be a piece of piss 
 laughter i should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes  most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them
  when somebody else is picking up the tab  anyway here 's number one  i
 wish for you to help
 build a social movement of more than one million american activists for africa
 is my first wish i believe it 's possible a few minutes ago i talked about
 all the citizens  ' campaigns that are springing up 
 you know there 's lots out there and with this one campaign as our umbrella my organization data and other groups have been tapping into the energy and
 and the enthusiasm that 's out there from hollywood into the heartland of america
 we know there 's more than enough energy to power this movement we just need your help
 in making it happen  
 we want all of you here church america corporate america microsoft america apple america coke america pepsi america nerd america noisy america  
 we can 't afford to be cool
 and sit this one out i do believe if we build a movement
 that 's one million americans
  strong  we 're not going to be denied we will have the ear of congress we
 'll be the first page in condi rice 's briefing book and
 right into the oval office if there 's one million americans and i really know this
 who are ready to make phone calls who are ready to be on email  i am absolutely sure
 that we can actually change
  the course
 of history  literally for the continent of africa  anyway so i 'd like your help in getting that signed up 
 i know john gage
 and sun microsystems are already on board for this but there 's lots of you we 'd like to talk to right my second wish 
 number two
  would like one media hit for every person on the planet
 who is living on less than one dollar a day that 's
 one billion media hits could be on google could be on aol steve case
  're talking to abc today about the oscars we have a film  produced by jon
 kamen at radical media  
 but you know we want we need some airtime for our ideas  we need to get the math  we need to get the statistics out to the american people i really believe
 that old truman line that
  if you give the american people the facts they 'll do the right thing 
 and the other thing that 's important is that this is not sally struthers this has to be described as an adventure not a burden 
 one by one they step forward a nurse a teacher a homemaker  and lives are saved  the problem is enormous every three seconds one person dies  
  one more 
 the situation is so desperate in parts of africa  asia  even america  that aid groups just as they did for the tsunami are uniting as one  
 acting as one we can beat extreme poverty starvation aids 
 but we need your help one more person letter voice will mean the difference between life
 and death for millions of people  please join us by working together
  americans have an unprecedented opportunity we can make history  we can start to make poverty history 
 one by one by one  
 please visit one at this address we 're not asking for your money we 're asking for your voice
  show the power of information its power to
 rewrite the rules and transform lives by connecting every hospital  health clinic and school
 in one african country and i would like it to be ethiopia  i believe
 we can connect every school in ethiopia every health clinic
  every hospital we can connect
 to the internet  that is my wish my third wish  i think it 's possible  i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that  and
 that would be a 
 wish to come true i 've been to ethiopia as i said earlier  it 's actually where it all
  the idea that the internet  which changed all of our lives can transform a country
 and a continent that has hardly made it to analog let alone digital
 blows my mind  but it didn 't start out that way the first
  on the phone it was just nine years later
 that addis ababa
 was connected by phone to harare  which is five hundred kilometers away  
 since then not that much has changed the average
 waiting time to get a landline in ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years
 but wireless technology wasn 't dreamt up
 then  anyway  i 'm irish and as you can see i know how important talking is
 communication is very important for ethiopia will transform the country  nurses getting better training pharmacists being able to order supplies
  doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine  it 's a very very good idea
 to get them wired  and that is my third and final wish for you at the ted conference thank you very much once again
