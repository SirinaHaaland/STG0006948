  i grew up with my identical twin who
 was an incredibly loving brother 
 now one thing about being a twin is it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism if his cookie
  was even slightly bigger than my cookie i had questions  and clearly i wasn 't starving 
 when i became a psychologist  
 i began to notice favoritism of a different kind  and that is how much more we value the body
 than we do the mind i spent nine years at university
 earning my doctorate in psychology  and i can 't tell you how many people look at my business card and say oh a psychologist  
 so not a real doctor 
 as if it should say that on my card
 everywhere  i recently was at a friend 's house and 
 was getting ready for bed  he was standing on a stool by the sink brushing his teeth when he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell  
 he cried for a minute but then he got back up got back on the stool and reached out for a box of
  to put one on his cut 
 now 
 this kid could barely tie his shoelaces  but he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesn 't become infected and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day 
 we all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene  right we 've known it
 since we were five years old but what do we know about maintaining our psychological health
  well  nothing what do we teach our children about emotional hygiene  
 nothing how is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth
 than we do our minds why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health
  psychological injuries
 even more often than we do physical ones injuries like failure
 or rejection or loneliness and they can also get worse if we ignore them  
 and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways
  and yet even though there are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries 
 we don 't  
 it doesn 't
  even occur to us that we should oh you 're feeling depressed just shake it off it 's all in your head 
 can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg oh just walk it off it 's all in your leg 
 it is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological
  time we made them more equal 
 more like twins  
 speaking of which my brother is also a psychologist  so he 's not a real doctor either 
 we didn 't study together though in fact  the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life
 is move across the atlantic to new york city to get my doctorate in psychology  we were apart then for the first time
  in our lives and the separation was brutal for both of us  but while he remained among family and friends i was alone in a new country  
 we missed each other terribly but international phone calls were really expensive then and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week
 when our birthday rolled around it was the first we wouldn 't be spending together we
  to splurge and that week  we would talk for ten minutes i spent the morning pacing around my room waiting for him to call
 and waiting 
 and waiting  but the phone didn 't ring  given the time difference i assumed ok he 's out with friends he 'll call later there were no cell
  i began to realize that after being away for over ten months  he no longer missed me
 the way i missed him i knew he would call in the morning but
 that night
 was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life 
 i woke up the next morning  i glanced down at the phone and i realized i had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before
 i stumbled out of bed  i put the phone back on the receiver  and it rang a second later  
 and it was my brother  and boy was he pissed 
 laughter it was the saddest and longest night of his life as well now 
 i tried to explain what happened but he said i don 't understand if you saw i wasn 't calling you why didn 't you just pick up the phone and call me
  he was right  
 why didn 't i call him i didn 't have an answer then  but i do today  and it 's a simple one 
 loneliness 
 loneliness creates a deep psychological wound 
 one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking  it makes us believe that those around us
  care much less than they actually do 
 it make us really afraid to reach out because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand 
 i was in the grips of real loneliness back then but
 i was surrounded by people all day so it never occurred to me  but loneliness is defined purely subjectively
 it depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you and i did  
 there is a lot of research on loneliness and all of it
 is horrifying loneliness won 't just make you miserable it will kill you i 'm not
  chronic loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death by fourteen percent  fourteen percent 
 loneliness causes high blood pressure  
 high cholesterol it even suppress the functioning of your immune system  making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases 
 in fact scientists have concluded that taken together  chronic loneliness poses as significant a risk for your
 as cigarette smoking now  cigarette packs come with warnings saying this could kill you 
 but loneliness doesn 't 
 and that 's why it 's so important that we prioritize our psychological health that we practice emotional hygiene  
 because you can 't treat a psychological wound if you don 't even know you 're injured 
 loneliness
  isn 't the only psychological wound that distorts our perceptions and misleads us failure
 does that as well  
 i once visited a day care center  where i saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys  
 you had to slide the red button  and a cute doggie would pop out 
 one little girl tried pulling the purple button  then pushing it
  and then she just sat back and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling 
 the little boy next to her watched this happen then turned to his box and burst into tears without even touching it 
 meanwhile another little girl tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button the cute doggie popped out 
 and she squealed with delight 
 so three toddlers with identical
  plastic toys  but with very different reactions to failure  the first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button  
 the only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind
 tricked them into believing they could not now  adults get tricked this way as well all
  we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure  
 you need to be because if your mind tries to convince you you 're incapable of something  and you believe it 
 then like those two toddlers you 'll begin to feel helpless
 and you 'll stop trying too soon or you won 't even try at all and then you 'll be even more convinced you can 't succeed
  succeed  
 you see that 's why so many people function below their actual potential  
 because somewhere along the way sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn 't succeed  and they believed it 
 once we become convinced of something it 's very difficult to change our mind 
 i learned that lesson the hard way when i was a teenager with my brother we were driving with friends down a
  road at night when a police car stopped us there had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects  the officer approached the car  and shined his flashlight on the driver 
 then on my brother in the front seat  and then on me  and his eyes opened wide and he said where have i seen your face before
  but that made no sense to him whatsoever so now he thought i was on drugs 
 laughter so he drags me out of the car he searches me  he marches me over to the police car  and only when he verified i didn 't have a police record could i show him i had a twin in the front
  even as we were driving away you could see by the look on his face he was convinced that i was getting away with something 
 our mind is hard to change once we become convinced so it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail  but you cannot
 allow yourself to become convinced you can 't succeed  you have to fight feelings of
  you have to gain control over the situation and you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins [ stop emotional bleeding ]
 our minds and our feelings
 they 're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were 
 they 're more like a really moody friend who can be totally supportive one minute 
 and really unpleasant the next  i once worked with this woman who after twenty years marriage
 and an extremely ugly divorce
 was finally ready for her first date she had met this guy online and he seemed nice and he seemed successful and most importantly he seemed really into her 
 so she was very excited she bought a new dress and they met at an upscale new york city bar for a drink 
 ten minutes into the date the man stands up and says i 'm not interested and walks out
 rejection
 is extremely painful 
 the woman was so hurt she couldn 't move all she could do was call a friend
 here 's what the friend said 
 well  what do you expect 
 you have big hips you have nothing interesting to say  why would a handsome successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you
  friend could be so cruel  but it would be much less shocking if i told you it wasn 't the friend who said that it
 's what the woman said to herself  
 and that 's something we all do  
 especially after a rejection we all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings what we wish we were what we wish we weren 't we call ourselves names maybe not as harshly  but we all do it
 's interesting that we do because
 our self esteem is already hurting  
 why would we want to go and damage it even further 
  we wouldn 't make a physical injury worse on purpose you wouldn 't get a cut on your arm and decide oh i know i 'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper i can make it 
 but we do that with psychological injuries
  all the time why because of poor emotional hygiene  because we don 't prioritize our psychological health  
 we know from dozens of studies that when your self esteem is lower  you are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety that failures and rejections hurt more  and it takes longer to recover from them 
 so when you get rejected the first thing you should be doing is to revive your
  join fight club and beat it into a pulp when you 're in emotional pain treat yourself with the same compassion
 you would expect from a truly good friend [ protect your self esteem ]
 we have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits and change them  and one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination 
 to ruminate means to chew over it 's when your boss yells at you or your professor makes you
  feel stupid in class or you have big fight with a friend
 and you just can 't stop replaying the scene in your head for days  sometimes for weeks on end 
 now  ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit  and it 's a very costly one 
 because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts  you are actually putting yourself at significant risk
  for developing clinical depression  alcoholism  eating disorders and even cardiovascular disease  
 the problem is the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important so it 's a difficult habit to stop
  i know this for a fact  because a little over a year ago  i developed the habit
  you see my twin brother
 was diagnosed with stage three non hodgkin 's lymphoma 
 his cancer was extremely aggressive he had visible tumors all over his body 
 and he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy  
 and i couldn 't stop thinking about what he was going through  i couldn 't stop thinking about how much he was suffering 
 even though
 he never complained
  once he had this incredibly positive attitude his psychological health was amazing  
 i was physically healthy  but psychologically i was a mess  
 but i knew what to do studies tell us that even a  two minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in
  and so each time i had a worrying upsetting negative thought i forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed 
 and within one week  my whole outlook changed and became more positive
 and more hopeful [ battle negative thinking ]
 nine weeks after he started chemotherapy my brother had a cat scan  and i was by his side when he got the results
  all the tumors were gone he still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go but we knew he would recover this picture
 was taken two weeks ago
  by taking action when you 're lonely by changing your responses to failure by protecting 
 by battling negative thinking  you won 't just heal your psychological wounds
 you will build emotional resilience  you will thrive 
 a hundred years ago  people began practicing personal hygiene  
 and life expectancy rates rose by over fifty percent in just a matter of decades  
 i believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically
  if we all began practicing emotional hygiene  can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier 
 if there were less loneliness and less depression if people knew how to overcome failure 
 if they felt better about themselves and more empowered if they were happier and more fulfilled 
 i can because that 's the world i want to live in  
 and that 's the world my brother
 wants to live in as well
 and if you just become informed and change a few simple habits well
 that 's the world we can all live in thank you very much
