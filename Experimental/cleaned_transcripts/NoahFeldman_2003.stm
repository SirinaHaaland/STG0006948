  i want to argue to you that in fact  
 politics and religion 
 which are the two primary factors not the sole but overwhelmingly the primary factors which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely bordering on the inevitable at this point whether one is in favor of that or not
 that politics and religion
 are in fact themselves better conceptualized as kinds of technology 
 and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider in the space of conceptual design 
 here 's what i mean  
 politics
 and let 's focus on the political system in particular question here which is the system of democracy  democracy as a type of politics
 is a technology for the control and deployment of power 
 you can deploy power in a wide range of ways  
 the famous ones despotism is a good one anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way to do it in a radically diffused fashion and democracy is a set of technologies  
 which have the effect of in principle  diffusing the power source to a large number of
  in a smaller group of people who govern  and who themselves are in principle  authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader broader public has done 
 now consider religion in this case islam which is the religion
 that in some direct sense can be said to be precipitating what we 're about to enter let me say parenthetically why i think that 's the case because i think it 's a potentially controversial
  i would put it in the following equation no nine eleven  no war
 at the beginning of the bush administration when president bush now president bush was running for president 
 he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world in fact  the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world 
 that 's why we heard about the backing away from the kyoto protocol for example  
 after nine eleven  the tables were turned  and
 the president decided with his advisors to undertake some kind of an active
  intervention in the world around us 
 that began with afghanistan and when afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly a decision was made through the technology of democracy
 again notice not a perfect technology but through the technology of democracy that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war this time a war in iraq 
 now 
 the reason i begin by saying no nine eleven
  no war is that we have to acknowledge that islam
 as interpreted by a very very small extremely radical group of people 
 was a precipitating cause of the nine eleven attacks the precipitating cause of the nine eleven attacks and as a consequence at one degree of
  precipitating cause of the coming war that we 're about to be engaged in and i would add that bin laden and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between
 democracy or at least capitalist democracy on the one hand  and
 the world of islam as they see and define it 
 now how is islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus well it 's a technology for first salvation in its most basic sense it 's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a
  that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer  
 but it 's also meant by the islamists and i use that term to mean people who believe that islam they follow the slogan islam is the answer to a wide range of questions whether they 're social or political or personal or spiritual 
 within the sphere of people who have that view  and it 's a large number of people in the muslim world who disagree with bin laden in his application but agree that islam is the answer islam represents a way of engaging the
  world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals and
 the goals from the perspective of muslims are in principle  peace  justice and equality  
 but on terms that correspond to traditional muslim teachings 
 now i don 't want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions rather either of these phenomena democracy or islam as technologies
  don 't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to and i think a good way to prove this
 is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was when deciding what to put on the on the wall behind me when i spoke  
 and i ran immediately into a conceptual problem you can 't show a picture of democracy  
 you can show a slogan  or a symbol  or a sign that stands for democracy you can show the capitol i had the same problem when i was designing the cover of my forthcoming book in fact what do you put on the cover
  to show democracy and the same problem with respect to islam  you can show a mosque or you can show worshippers  but there 's not a straightforward way of depicting islam that 's because these are the kinds of concepts that are not susceptible to easy representation 
 now it follows from that that they 're deeply contestable 
 it follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are muslims
  in principle subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what islam really is  and the same is true of democracy 
 in other words  unlike
 the word hope which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for and perhaps reach some kind of a consensual use analysis these are essentially contested concepts they 're ideas
 about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense  and as a consequence of this disagreement
  very very difficult for anyone to say i have the right version of islam you know post 9 eleven we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of george w bush saying islam means peace 
 well  so says george w bush other people would say it means something else some people would say that islam means submission other people would say it means an acknowledgement or recognition of god 's
  a wide range of different things that islam can mean and ostensibly the same is true of democracy  
 some people say that democracy consists basically in elections 
 other people say no that 's not enough there have to be basic liberal rights free speech free press equality of citizens these are contested points and it 's impossible to answer them by saying ah ha i looked in the right place and i found out what these concepts mean 
 now if islam and democracy
 are at present in a moment of great confrontation what does that mean
  well  you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks  you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago which was fear 
 fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner
 and with a very very high likelihood that many many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation
  many people in the muslim world do not want  
 many many people in the american democracy do not want many people elsewhere in the world do not want but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people at least in the relevant
 space which is the united states
 to actually go forward  so fear is not a crazy response at all and i think that that 's in fact  probably the first appropriate response 
 what i want to suggest to you though in the next couple of minutes
 is that there 's also a hopeful response to this and the hopeful response
  derives from recognizing
 that islam and democracy are technologies  and by virtue of being technologies  they 're manipulable 
 and they 're manipulable in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes what do i have in mind 
 well all over the muslim world
 there are people who take islam deeply seriously  people who care about islam for whom it 's a source either of faith  or of civilization or of deep values  or just a source of
  powerful personal identity who think and are saying loudly that islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict but are in fact deeply compatible 
 and these muslims and it 's the vast majority of muslims
 disagree profoundly with bin laden 's approach  profoundly  
 and they furthermore think overwhelmingly again one can 't speak of every person but overwhelmingly and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they
 have produced and they 're all over the internet and in all sorts of languages
 one can see that they 're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up
 free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life 
 in the sphere of economics in the sphere of politics and yes in the sphere of religion which
  closely regulated in most of the muslim world and many of these muslims further say that their disagreement with the united states
 is that it in the past and still in the present has sided
 with autocratic rulers in the muslim world in order to
 promote america 's short term interests  now during the cold war that may have been a defensible position for the united states to take that 's an
  it may be that there was a a great war to be fought between west and east and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism and it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them 
 but now that the cold war is over 
 there 's nearly universal consensus in the muslim world and pretty close to the same here in the united states if you talk to people and ask them
  that in principle there 's no reason that democracy and islam cannot  co exist 
 and we see this among activist practical muslims like the muslims who are presently the elected parliamentary democratic government of turkey 
 who are behaving pragmatically not ideologically 
 who are promoting their own religious values who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values  
 but who do not think that islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible 
 now you may say  but surely
  what we 've seen on television about saudi islam convinces us that it can 't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy
 namely free political choice basic liberty and basic equality  but i 'm here to tell you
 that technologies are more malleable than that i 'm here to tell you that many many muslims believe
  the vast majority in fact in fact i think i would go so far as to say that many muslims in saudi arabia believe
 that the core values of islam namely acknowledgement of god 's sovereignty
 and basic human equality before god are themselves compatible with liberty equality and free political choice  
 and there are muslims many muslims out there who are saying precisely this  
 and they 're making this argument wherever they 're permitted to make it but their governments  needless to say are relatively threatened by this and for the most part try to stop them from making this argument so for example a group
  of young activists in egypt try to form a party known as the center party which advocated the compatibility of islam and democracy they weren 't even allowed to form a party  
 they were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there why because they would have done extraordinarily well  
 in the most recent elections in the muslim world which are those in pakistan those in morocco and those in turkey in each
  people who present themselves to the electorate as islamic democrats were far and away the most successful  vote getters every place they were allowed to run freely
  so in morocco for example they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats  so had they contested a larger number of the seats they would have done even better 
 now what i want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are
  on the edge of a real transformation in the muslim world 
 and that 's a transformation in which many sincerely believing muslims who care very very deeply about their traditions who do not want to
 compromise those values
 believe through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of islam 
 that these two ideas can work together
  what would that look like 
 what does it mean to say that there 's an islamic democracy  well one thing is it 's not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the united states  that may be a good thing 
 in light of some of the criticisms we 've heard today for example in the regulatory context of what democracy produces  
 it will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room  or muslims out in the rest of the world i don 't mean to imply there
  it will be transformative of islam as well  
 and as a result of this convergence this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together  there 's a real possibility
 that instead of a clash of islamic civilization if there is such a thing and democratic civilization if there is such a thing we 'll in fact have close compatibility 
 now i began with the war because it 's the elephant in the room and you can 't pretend that there
  about to be a war if you 're talking about these issues the war has tremendous risks for the model that i 'm describing
 because it 's very possible that as a consequence of a war many muslims will conclude that the united states is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government 
 on the other hand  there 's a further possibility that many
  swept up in the fever of a war 
 will say and feel and think that islam is the enemy somehow that islam ought to be construed as the enemy and even though for political tactical reasons the president has been very very good about saying that islam is not the enemy  
 nonetheless there 's a natural impulse when one enters war
 to think of the other side as an enemy  and one furthermore has the impulse to generalize as much as possible in defining who that enemy is so the risks are very great 
 on the other hand the
  capacities for positive results
 in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated 
 even by and i would say especially by people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place 
 those who oppose the war
 ought to realize that if a war happens  it cannot be the right strategy 
  or morally to say after the war well  let 's let it all run itself out and play out however it wants to play out because we opposed the war in the first place 
 that 's not the way human circumstances operate you face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward 
 well  what i 'm here to say then is for people who are skeptical about the war it 's especially important to recognize
 that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the united states and the muslim peoples
  interacts
 to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly islamic and it is crucial it is crucial in a practical activist way
 for people who care about these issues
 to make sure that within the technology of democracy in this system they exercise their preferences their choices and their voices
 to encourage that outcome  that 's a hopeful message but it 's a message that 's hopeful
  only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us  
 and i think that we are capable of taking on that obligation but only if we put what we can into it and if we do then i don 't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether
