  and olivia the dog is sixteen
  so let 's talk about aging let me tell you how i feel when i see my wrinkles in the mirror
 and i realize that some parts of me have dropped and i can 't find them
 down there 
 mary oliver says in one of her poems 
 tell me what is it that you plan to do with your one wild and precious life me i intend to live
  passionately 
 when do we start aging society decides when we are old usually around 
 when we get medicare  
 but we really start aging at birth we are aging right now  and we all experience it differently 
 we all feel younger than our real age because the spirit never ages
  i am still seventeen  sophia loren  look at her  she says that everything you see
 she owes to spaghetti  i tried it and gained ten pounds in the wrong places  but attitude 
 aging is also
  but my real mentor in this journey of aging is olga murray 
 this california girl at sixty started working in nepal to save young girls from domestic bondage at eighty eight she 
  has saved twelve thousand girls and she has changed the culture in the country  
  she has also founded orphanages and nutritional clinics she is always happy and eternally young 
 what have i lost in the last decades 
 people of course  
 places  and the boundless energy of my youth  and i 'm beginning to lose independence and that scares me  
 ram dass
 says that dependency hurts 
 but if you accept it there is less suffering after a very bad stroke his ageless soul watches the changes in the body with tenderness 
 and he is grateful to the people who help him 
 what have i gained
  i don 't have to prove anything anymore  i 'm not stuck in the idea of who i was who i want to be or what other people expect me
 to be  i don 't have to please men anymore  
 only animals  i keep telling my superego to back off
 and let me enjoy what i still have my body may be falling apart but my brain is not yet
 i love my brain  i feel lighter  
 i don 't carry grudges  ambition  vanity 
 none of the deadly sins that are not even worth the trouble 
 it 's great to let go  i should have started sooner  and i also feel softer
 because i 'm not scared of being
 vulnerable i don 't see it as weakness anymore  
 and i 've gained spirituality  i 'm aware that before  death was in the neighborhood 
 now it 's next door or in my house  
 i try to live mindfully and be present in the moment by the way the dalai lama is someone who has aged beautifully
 but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate
  to age in this culture inside  i feel
 good i feel charming seductive sexy  nobody else sees that 
 i 'm invisible  i want to be the center of attention i hate to be invisible this
  has been in a wheelchair for six years after a terrible car accident  she says that
 there is nothing more sensual than a hot shower that every drop of water is a blessing to the senses  
 she doesn 't see herself as disabled in her mind she 's still surfing in the ocean 
 ethel  seiderman a feisty beloved activist in the place where i live in california
  she wears red patent shoes and her mantra is that one scarf is nice but two is better she has been a widow for nine years 
 but she 's not looking for another mate  she says that there is only a limited number of ways you can screw well she says it in another way
  on the other hand i still have erotic fantasies with antonio banderas and my poor husband has to put up with it 
 so how can i stay passionate  i cannot will myself to be passionate at 
 i have been training for some time  and when i
  how do i train i train by saying yes to whatever comes my way  drama  comedy tragedy love death losses  
 yes to life  
 and i train
 by trying to stay in love it doesn 't always work but you cannot blame me for trying
  we have paid our dues we have contributed to society now it 's our time  and it 's a great time  
 unless you are ill or very poor you have choices  
 i have chosen to stay passionate  engaged
  i never like to presume to speak for the ted community but i would like to
  tell you that i have a feeling we can all agree that you are still charming seductive and sexy
