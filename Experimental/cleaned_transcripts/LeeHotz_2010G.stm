  come with me to the bottom of the world 
 antarctica 
 the highest  driest  windiest and yes coldest region on earth more arid than the sahara and in parts colder than mars 
 the ice of antarctica glows with a light so dazzling
  blinds the unprotected eye  early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it 
 the weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level beneath its weight  yet the ice of antarctica is a calendar of climate change  
 it records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages  nowhere on earth
 offers us such a perfect record 
 and here scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change 
 this past january i traveled to a place called wais divide about six hundred miles from the south pole  it is the best place on the planet many say to
 study the history of climate change there
 about forty five scientists from the university of wisconsin the desert research institute in nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming 
  what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures it 's urgent work we know that temperatures are rising this past may was the warmest worldwide on
  and we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too what we don 't know is the exact precise  immediate impact of these changes on natural climate 
  patterns winds ocean currents precipitation rates cloud formation things that bear on the health and well being of billions of people 
  from mcmurdo station the main u s supply base on the coast of antarctica  
 wais divide itself though is a circle of tents in the snow 
 in blizzard winds  the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house
 and to the nearest outhouse  it snows so heavily there the installation was
  the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here ten times faster than anywhere else in antarctica  they have to dig themselves out every day 
 it makes for an exotic
 and chilly commute but under the surface
 is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight million dollar
  like a biopsy needle plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis 
 ten times a day they extract the 10 foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow season after season for thousands of years  
 it 's really a time machine at the peak of activity
  this year  the researchers
 lowered the drill
 an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another three hundred and sixty five years deeper into the past  
 periodically they remove a
 cylinder of ice like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill
  they inspect it they check it for cracks for drill damage for spalls for chips 
 more importantly they prepare it for inspection and analysis by twenty seven independent laboratories in the united states and europe  who will examine it for forty different trace chemicals related to climate 
 some in parts per quadrillion yes  i said that with a q quadrillion
  they cut the cylinders up into three foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs  some eight thousand miles from the drill site  
 each cylinder
 is a parfait of time 
 this ice formed as snow fifteen thousand eight hundred years ago  when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology
 of the alphabet
  bathed in polarized light and cut in cross section this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected
 this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch 
  it begins with a snowflake and by digging into fresh snow we can see how this process is ongoing today 
 this wall of undisturbed snow back lit by sunlight  shows the striations of winter and summer snow layer upon layer  
 each storm scours the atmosphere  washing out dust  
  trace chemicals 
 and depositing them on the snow pack year after year millennia after millennia  
 creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than eleven thousand feet thick 
 from this we can detect an extraordinary number of things we can see
 the calcium from the world 's deserts soot from
  as an indicator of the strength of a pacific monsoon all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place 
 most importantly  
 these cylinders and this snow trap air  each cylinder is about ten percent ancient air a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane
  nitrous oxide all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell and this is the object of their scrutiny  but
 don 't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases why do we need to study this anymore don 't we already know how they affect temperatures don 't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization 
 the truth is we only know the outlines
  and what we don 't completely understand we can 't properly fix  indeed we run the risk of making things worse  consider  the single most successful international 
  environmental effort of the 20th century the montreal protocol in which the nations of earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of
  chemicals used at that time in air conditioners
  refrigerators and other cooling devices we banned those chemicals and we replaced them unknowingly 
 with other substances that molecule per molecule are a hundred times more potent as heat trapping greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide  
 this process requires
 extraordinary precautions  the scientists must insure that the
  they have to insure this ice doesn 't melt  imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics  
 they have to in fact make sure this ice never gets warmer than about twenty degrees below zero  otherwise the key gases inside it will dissipate  so in the coldest place on earth 
 they work inside a refrigerator 
 as they handle the ice in fact they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven
  that when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen they can don a fresh pair  they work against the clock and against the thermometer 
 so far they 've packed up about four thousand five hundred feet of ice cores for shipment back to the united states this past season they manhandled them across the ice
  air national guard flew the most recent shipment of ice
 back to the coast of antarctica where it was boarded onto a freighter  
 shipped across the tropics to california  unloaded put on a truck driven across the desert
 to the national ice core laboratory in denver colorado where as we speak  scientists are now slicing this material up for samples for analysis to be distributed
 to the
 around the country and in europe 
 antarctica
 was this planet 's last empty quarter
 the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world  
 early explorers sailed off the edge of the map 
 and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended 
 here
 ice seems a living presence  the wind that rubs against it gives it voice  
 it is a voice of experience  it is a voice
 we should heed
