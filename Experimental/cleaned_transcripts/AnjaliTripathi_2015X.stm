  at the stars at night it 's amazing what you can see it 's beautiful  
 but what 's more amazing is what you can 't see because what we know now is that around every star or almost every star there 's a planet  
 or probably a few
  so what this picture isn 't showing you are all the planets that we know about out there in space  
 but when we think about planets we tend to think of faraway things that are very different from our own  but here we are on a planet
 and there are so many things that are amazing about earth that we 're searching far and wide to find things that are like that 
 and when we 're searching we 're finding amazing things
 i want to tell you about an amazing thing here on earth 
 and that is that every minute four hundred pounds of hydrogen and almost seven pounds of helium
 escape from earth into space and this is gas
 that is going off and never coming back  so hydrogen helium and many other things make up what 's known as the earth
  's atmosphere 
 the atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line that 's seen here from the international space station a photograph that some astronauts took  
 and this tenuous veneer around our planet is what allows life to flourish  it protects our planet from too many impacts from meteorites and the like 
 and it 's such an amazing
 that the fact that it 's disappearing
 should frighten you at least a little bit so this process is something that i study
 and it 's called atmospheric escape  
 so atmospheric escape is not specific to planet earth it
 's part of what it means to be a planet if you ask me because planets not just here on earth but
  throughout the universe can undergo atmospheric escape  and the way it happens actually tells us
 about planets themselves because when you think about the solar system  you might think about this picture here  
 and you would say well there are eight planets maybe nine  so for those of you who are stressed by this picture i will add somebody for you
  new horizons we 're including pluto  
 and the thing here is for the purposes of this talk and atmospheric escape  pluto is a planet in my mind in the same way that planets around other stars that we can 't see
 are also planets 
 so fundamental characteristics of planets include the fact that they are bodies that are bound together by gravity so it 's a lot of material just stuck together
  with this attractive force  
 and these bodies are so big and have so much gravity that 's why they 're round  so when you look at all of these including pluto they 're round  
 so you can see that gravity is really at play here  but another fundamental characteristic about planets is what you don 't see here  and that 's the star
  all of the planets in the solar system are orbiting around and that 's fundamentally driving atmospheric escape  
 the reason that fundamentally stars drive atmospheric escape from planets is because stars
 offer planets particles and light and heat
 that can cause the atmospheres to go away  so if you think of a hot air balloon  or you look at this picture of lanterns in thailand at a festival
  see that hot air can propel gasses upward and if you have enough energy and heating which our sun does that gas which is so light and only bound by gravity  it can escape into space 
 and so this is what 's actually causing atmospheric escape here on earth and also on other planets that interplay between heating from the star and overcoming the force of gravity
 on the planet  so i 've told you that it happens at the rate of four hundred pounds a minute for hydrogen and almost seven pounds for helium  
 but what does that look like 
 well even in the ' 80s 
 we took pictures of the earth in the ultraviolet using nasa 's dynamic explorer spacecraft  so these two images of the earth show you what that glow of escaping hydrogen
  like shown in red  
 and you can also see other features like oxygen and nitrogen in that white glimmer in the circle showing you the auroras and also some wisps around the tropics 
  so these are pictures that conclusively show us that our atmosphere isn 't just tightly bound to us here on earth but it 's actually reaching out far into space and at an alarming rate i might add
  but the earth is not alone in undergoing atmospheric escape 
 mars our nearest neighbor  is much smaller than earth  so it has much less gravity with which to hold on to its atmosphere 
 and so even though mars has an atmosphere we can see it 's much thinner than the earth 's just look at the surface  you see craters indicating that it didn 't have an atmosphere that could stop those impacts 
 also we see that it 's the red planet
 and atmospheric escape plays a role in mars being red 
 that 's because we think mars used to have a wetter past and when water had enough energy it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen 
 and hydrogen being so light  it escaped into space and the oxygen that was left
 oxidized or rusted the ground making that that familiar rusty red color that we see
  so it 's fine to look at pictures of mars and say that atmospheric escape probably happened but nasa has a probe that 's currently at mars called the maven satellite 
 and its actual job is to study atmospheric escape  it 's the mars atmosphere and volatile evolution spacecraft  
 and results from it have already shown pictures very
 similar to what you 've seen here on earth  
 we 've long known that mars was losing its atmosphere but we have some stunning pictures here for example you can see in the red circle is the size of mars and in blue you can see the hydrogen escaping away from the planet  
 so it 's reaching out more than ten times the size of the planet  far enough away that it 's no longer bound to that planet  it 's escaping off into space 
 and this helps us confirm ideas like why mars is red from that lost hydrogen 
  isn 't the only gas that 's lost i mentioned helium on earth and some oxygen and nitrogen and from maven we can also look at the oxygen being lost from mars 
 and you can see that because oxygen is heavier  it can 't get as far as the hydrogen 
 but it 's still escaping away from the planet you don 't see it all confined into that red circle
  so the fact that we not only see atmospheric escape on our own planet but we can study it elsewhere
 and send spacecraft allows us to learn about the past of planets but also about planets in general and earth 's future  
 so one way we actually can learn about the future is by planets so far away that we can 't see 
 and i should just note though before i go on to
  i 'm not going to show you photos like this of pluto  which might be disappointing  but that 's because we don 't have them yet but the new horizons mission is currently studying atmospheric escape being lost from the planet  so stay tuned and look out for that 
 but the planets that i did want to talk about are known as transiting exoplanets so any planet orbiting a star that 's not our sun is called an exoplanet or extrasolar planet  
 and these planets
 that we call transiting have the special feature that if you look at that star in the middle
 you 'll see that actually it 's blinking  
 and the reason that it 's blinking is because there are planets that are going past it all the time and it 's that special orientation where the planets are blocking the light from the star that allows us to see that light blinking 
 and by surveying the stars in the night sky for this blinking motion we are able to find planets this is how we 've now been able to detect
  over five thousand planets
 in our own milky way  and we know there are many more out there like i mentioned so
 when we look at the light from these stars what we see like i said is not the planet itself  but you actually see a dimming of the light that we can record in time  so the light 
 drops as the planet decreases in front of the star and that 's that blinking that you saw before so not only do we detect the planets but we can look at
  light in different wavelengths  so i mentioned looking at the earth and mars in ultraviolet light 
 if we look at transiting exoplanets with the hubble space telescope  we find that in the ultraviolet you see much bigger blinking much less light from the star when the planet is passing in front  and we think this is because you have an extended atmosphere
  of hydrogen all around the planet that 's making it look  puffier and thus blocking more of the light that you see  
 so using this technique we 've actually been able to discover a few transiting exoplanets that are undergoing atmospheric escape  
 and these planets can be called hot jupiters for some of the ones we 've found  and that 's because they 're gas planets like jupiter  but they 're so close to their star about a hundred times closer than jupiter  
 and because there 's all this lightweight gas that 's ready to escape and all this heating from the star
  star you have completely catastrophic rates of atmospheric escape  so unlike our four hundred pounds per minute of hydrogen being lost on earth for these planets 
 you 're losing one point three billion pounds of hydrogen every minute  
  rocky and planets further away are bigger and more gaseous could you have started with something like jupiter that was actually close to the sun and get rid of all the gas in it 
 we now think that if you start with something like a hot jupiter  you actually can 't end up with mercury or the earth but if you started with something smaller 
 it 's possible that enough gas would have gotten away that it would have significantly impacted it and left you with something very different than what you
  with so all of this sounds sort of general and
 we might think about the solar system  but what does this have to do with us here on earth  
 well in the far future the sun is going to get brighter  and as that happens the heating that we find from the sun is going to become very intense  
 in the same way that you see gas streaming off from a hot jupiter gas is going to stream off from the earth and so what
  can look forward to or at least prepare for is the fact that in the far future the earth is going to look more like mars 
 our hydrogen 
 from water that is broken down is going to escape into space more rapidly  and we 're going to be left with this dry  reddish planet  
 so don 't fear  it 's not for a few
  there 's some time to prepare 
 but i wanted you to be aware of what 's going on not just in the future  but atmospheric escape is happening as we speak  
 so there 's a lot of amazing science that you hear about happening in space and planets that are far away  and we are studying these planets to learn about these worlds  but as we learn about mars or exoplanets
 like hot jupiters  we find things like atmospheric escape
 that tell us a lot more about our planet here on earth  so consider that the next time you think that space is far away  thank you
