  do is to create a biologically inspired design  and so here 's the challenge i want you to help me create a fully 3d dynamic parameterized contact model
  translation of that is could you help me build a foot  and it is a true challenge and i do want you to help me of course in the challenge there is a prize it
 's not quite the ted prize  but it is an exclusive t shirt from our lab  so please send me your ideas
 about how to design a foot  now if we want to design a foot  what do we have to do
 we have to first know what a foot is if we go to the dictionary it says 
 it 's the lower extremity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking that 's the traditional definition but if you wanted to really do research what do you have to do you have to go to the literature and look up what 's known about feet  
 so you go to the literature laughter
 maybe you 're familiar with this literature
 the problem
  there are many many feet how do you do this you need to survey all feet
 and extract the principles of how they work and i want you to help me do that in this next clip as you see this clip look for principles and also think about experiments
 that you might design in order to understand
 how a foot works
  all
  animal locomotion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot  
 it 's a design inspired by nature but it 's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at  but it 's a synthesis of the secrets of
 many many feet now it
 turns out that animals can go anywhere they can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw in the probability of contact  
 the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present 
 if you want to study how a foot works we 're going to have to simulate those surfaces  or simulate that
  when we did that here 's a new experiment that we did  
 we put an animal and had it run this grass spider on a surface with ninety nine percent of the contact area removed  but it didn 't even slow down the animal it 's still running at the human equivalent of three hundred miles per hour now
 how could it do that well look more carefully when we slow it down fifty times we see
 how the leg is hitting that simulated debris the leg is acting
  and in fact  the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot the foot is distributed
 along the whole leg  you can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach
 with a foot  and you can remove its foot  i 'm passing some cockroaches around take a look at their feet  without a foot here 's what it does it doesn 't even slow
  can run the same speed without even that segment no problem for the cockroach they can grow them back if you care 
 how do they do it look carefully this is slowed down one hundred times 
 and watch what it 's doing with the rest of its leg it 's acting again as a distributed foot
 very effective now the question we had is how general is a distributed foot and the
  next behavior i 'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it  
 journalists this is off the record  it 's embargoed  take a look at what that is 
 that 's a bipedal octopus
 that 's disguised as a rolling coconut
  it was discovered by christina huffard and filmed by sea studios right here from monterey
 we 've also described
 another species
 of bipedal octopus this one disguises itself as floating algae  it walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air
 so that it can 't be seen and look
 what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain
  it uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there
 truly extraordinary in one
 thousand nine hundred and fifty one escher made this drawing he thought he created an animal fantasy  
 but we know that art imitates life and it turns out nature  three million years ago evolved the next animal
  stomatopod and here 's how it moves on the beaches of panama  
 it actually rolls and it can even roll uphill it 's the ultimate distributed foot its whole body in this case is acting
 like its foot  
 so if we want to then to
  the first important feature we want to add distributed foot contact not just with the traditional foot  but also the leg and even of the body 
 can this help us inspire the design of novel robots  we biologically inspired this robot named rhex built by these extraordinary
 engineers over the last few years rhex 's foot started off to be quite simple then it got tuned over time and ultimately resulted in this half circle 
 why is that the video will show you
 watch where the robot now contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain  
 what you 'll see in fact is that it 's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot  
 watch it go over this you can see it here well on this debris 
 extraordinary no sensing
  the control is built right into the tuned legs 
 really simple but beautiful now you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain  and my assistant 's going to help me here 
 when you touched the cockroach leg can
 you get the microphone for him when
 you touched the cockroach leg what did it
 feel like did you notice something boy spiny robert full it 's spiny right it 's
  sort of hurts maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he 'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach chris anderson did you touch it
 rf so if you look carefully at this what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago no one knew
 what they did they assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures we found that they 're for something else
 here 's a segment of that spine they 're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris  but they 're stiff in the other direction so
  they capture
 disparities in the surface  now crabs don 't miss footholds because they normally move on sand until they come to our lab  
 and where they have a problem with this kind of mesh  because they don 't have spines  
 the crabs are missing spines so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain  but of course we can deal with that
 because we can produce artificial spines
  we can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out we did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs as you see here 
  and then we tested them do we really understand that principle of tuning  the answer is yes  this is slowed down 20 fold and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris
  so to our blueprint we need to add tuned spines  
 now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots well here 's rhex rhex has trouble on rails on smooth rails as you see here  so why not add a spine 
 my colleagues did this at u penn dan koditschek put some steel nails very simple
  and here 's rhex now going over those steel those rails  
 no problem how does it do it let 's slow it down and you can see the spines in action watch the leg come around  and you 'll see it grab on right there it
 couldn 't do that before it would just slip and get stuck and tip over and watch again right there
 successful  now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn 't mean you can climb vertical
  this is really really difficult but look at this animal do it one of the ones i 'm passing around
 is climbing up this vertical surface that 's a smooth metal plate it
 's extraordinary how fast it can do it but if you slow it down you see something that 's quite extraordinary  it 's a secret  
 the animal effectively climbs by slipping and look and doing actually terribly with respect to grabbing on the surface it looks in fact like it 's swimming up the surface 
 we can actually model that behavior
 better as a fluid if you look at it the distributed foot  actually is working more like a paddle 
 the same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand 
 watch its feet  it 's actually functioning as a paddle even though it 's interacting with a
 surface that we normally think of as a solid
  this is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself 
 can you use this to make a better robot  martin buehler did who 's now at boston dynamics
 he took this idea and made rhex to be aqua rhex so here 's rhex with paddles  
 now converted into an incredibly maneuverable
 swimming robot
 for rough surfaces though animals add claws and you probably feel them if you grabbed it did you touch it ca i did rf 
 and they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws  mark cutkosky at stanford university one of my collaborators is an extraordinary engineer
 who developed this technique called shape deposition manufacturing where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot  and here 's the simple version of a foot for a new robot
  that i 'll show you in a bit  so to our blueprint  let 's attach claws  
 now if we look at animals though to be really maneuverable in all surfaces the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws and spines and hairs and pads and glue and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things 
 these are all from different insects there 's an ant crawling up a vertical surface let 's look at that ant 
  this is the foot of an ant you see the hairs and the claws and this thing here  this is when its foot 's in the air 
 watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich 
 you see what happens that pad comes out  and that 's where the glue is 
 here from underneath is an ant foot  and when the claws don 't dig in that pad automatically comes
 comes out without the ant doing anything it just extrudes and this was a hard shot to get i think this is 
 this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings so it 's pretty pretty tough to to do 
 this is what it looks like close up here 's the ant foot and there 's the glue and we discovered this glue may be an interesting two phase mixture it
 certainly helps it to hold on 
 so
 to our blueprint we stick on some sticky pads now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here  now we have something better
 the gecko 's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature 
 these are its feet they 're almost look alien and the secret  which they stick on with involves their hairy toes 
 they can run up a surface at a meter per second take thirty steps in that one second you can hardly see them if we slow it
  they attach their feet at eight milliseconds  and detach them in sixteen milliseconds  
 and when you watch how they detach it it is bizarre 
 they peel away from the surface like you 'd peel away a piece of tape 
 very strange
 how do they stick if you look at their feet they have leaf like structures called linalae with millions of hairs and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible 
 it has a hundred to a thousand split
  ends and that 's the secret  because it allows intimate contact the gecko has a billion of these 
  split ends  and they don 't stick by glue or they don 't work like velcro or they don 't work with suction  we discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone  
 so to our blueprint  we split some hairs  
  this has inspired the design of the first self cleaning dry adhesive the patent issued we 're happy to say and here 's the
 simplest version in nature  and here 's my collaborator ron fearing 's attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane  
 and here 's the first attempt to
 have it work on some load there 's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields you could think of a thousand possible uses
  lots of people have and we 're excited about realizing this as a product we have imagined products for example this one we imagined a
  where we took the glue off the band aid we took some hairs from a molting gecko put three rolls of them on here  and then made this band aid 
 this is an undergraduate volunteer we have thirty thousand undergraduates so we can choose among them
  that 's actually just a red red pen mark but it makes an incredible
 it 's aerated it can be peeled off easily it doesn
 't cause any irritation it works underwater
  i think this is an extraordinary example of how  curiosity based research we just wondered how they climbed up something can lead to things that you could never imagine it 's just an example of why we need to support
  now what a foot is 
 the question is can we use these secrets then to inspire the design of a better foot better than one that we see in nature  here 's the new project we
 're trying to create the first climbing  search and rescue robot no suction or magnets that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces  i call the new robot rise for
  robot in scansorial environment that 's a climbing environment
 and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot  and here is rise
 it 's six legged and has a tail here it is on a fence and a tree  and here are rise 's first steps on
  so this is very new but we think we got the dynamics right
 of the robot  mark cutkosky though is taking it a step further  he 's the one able to build this shape deposition manufactured
 feet and toes the next step is to make compliant toes and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives  so the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right 
 attempt to make that climb and ultimately put
  on the robot and that 's exactly what he 's done he 's built in fact a climbing foot bot
 inspired by nature  and here 's cutkosky 's and his amazing students ' design
  so these are tuned toes there are six of them
  and they use the principles that i just talked about collectively for the blueprint
  so this is not using any suction any glue and it will ultimately when it 's attached to the robot it 's as biologically inspired as the as the animal hopefully be able to climb
 any kind of a surface here you see it next going up the side of a building at stanford
  it 's a foot climbing it 's not the whole robot yet we 're working on it now you can see how it 's attaching these tuned structures
 allow the spines friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging difficult
 surfaces  and so they were able to get this thing this is now sped up twenty times can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor 
 ok you can visualize this now it 's not impossible it 's a very
  but more to come later to finish  
 we 've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built  
 we 've learned we should distribute control to smart parts don 't put it all in the brain  but put some of the control in tuned feet  legs and even body 
 that nature uses hybrid solutions not a single solution to these problems and they 're integrated and beautifully robust 
 and third  we believe strongly that we do not
 want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make potentially something
 better than nature
