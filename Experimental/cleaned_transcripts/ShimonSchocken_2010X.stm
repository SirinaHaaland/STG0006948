  in israel
 is something that i do with great passion and commitment and when i 'm on my bike  i feel that i connect with
  and i feel that i 'm united with this country 's
 history and biblical law  and also for me biking is a matter of
 of empowerment when i reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere  i feel young
 invincible  eternal  it 's as if i 'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than
  myself you can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture looking at me with some
 concern and here is another picture of them  unfortunately i cannot show their faces  neither can i
 disclose their true names  and that 's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates
  spending time in a correction facility about twenty minutes ' ride from here well like everything in israel  and
 i 've been riding with these kids once a week every tuesday  rain or shine  for the last four years and by now they 've become a
 very big part of my life 
 this story began four years ago the correction facility where they are locked up happens to be right in the middle of one of my usual trips  and it 's surrounded by barbed
  wires and electric gates and armed guards  so on one of these rides i talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden  
 i told the warden that i wanted to start a mountain biking club
 in this place and that basically i wanted to take the kids from here
 to there  and i told him let 's find a way in which i 'll be able to take out ten kids
  with in the summer in the country and the warden was quite amused and he told me he thought that i was a nut and he told me this place
 is a correction facility these guys are serious offenders they are
 supposed to be locked up they aren 't supposed to be out at large 
 and yet  we began to talk about it and
  see myself going into a
 state prison in new jersey and making such a proposition  but this being israel the warden somehow made it happen  
 and
 so
 two months later we found ourselves at large myself ten juvenile inmates
 and a wonderful fellow named russ who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project
  the next few weeks i had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom a world consisting of magnificent vistas
 like these everything you see here is obviously in israel
 as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes
 in spite of all this splendor the beginning was extremely frustrating  
 every small obstacle every slight uphill 
 would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up so we had a lot of this going on 
 i found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration
 and difficulties not because they were physically unfit
  why they ended up where they were  and i became increasingly more and more agitated because i was there
 not only to be with them but also to ride and create a team and i didn 't know what
 to do now let me give you an example we
 're going downhill in some rocky terrain  and the front tire of alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here
 and he gets slightly injured  but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike
 and curse violently  then he throws his helmet in the air his backpack goes ballistic in some other direction 
 and then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and and curse like i 've never heard
 standing there  watching this scene with a complete disbelief not knowing what to do i 'm used to
 algorithms and data structures and
 super motivated students  and
 nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging  violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere
  have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations they happened in places like this in the
 judean desert twenty kilometers away from the nearest road  and what you don 't see in this picture is that somewhere
 between these riders there there 's a teenager sitting on a rock
 one way or another you have to get this guy moving because
 it 's getting dark soon and dangerous 
 it took me several such incidents to figure out what i was supposed to do at the beginning it was a disaster i tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere that 's what they had all their lives 
 and at some point i found out when a kid like this gets into a fit the best thing that you can possibly do is stay
 as close as possible to this kid which is
 difficult because what you really want to do is go away but that 's what he had all his life  people walking away from him so what you have to do is stay close
 and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate so i would say alex  i know that
  have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry and after the rides
  when he was eight  someone put him on a boat in odessa
 and sent him  shipped him to israel on his own  and he ended up in south tel aviv
 and did not have the good luck
 to be picked up by a [ unclear ] and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member  and he spent the last ten
 years of his life in two places only the slums
 and the state prison where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there  and so
 this kid was probably
 abused abandoned  ignored betrayed by almost every adult along the way
  when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn 't walk away from him in any situation
 irrespective of how he behaves  it 's a tremendous healing experience  it 's an act of
 unconditional acceptance something that he never had i want to say a few words about vision  when i started this program four years ago
  i had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs  i had an image of lance armstrong
 in my mind and
 it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was
 misplaced and that there was another vision supremely more
  a sudden dawned on me in this project that the purpose of these rides
 should actually be to expose the kids
 to one thing only  love  love to the country to the uphill
 and the downhill to all the incredible creatures that surround us the animals the plants the insects
 love and respect to
 other fellow members in
  team in your biking team and most importantly  love and respect to yourself
 which is something that they badly
 miss together with the kids i also went through a remarkable transformation now i come from a cutthroat world of science and
 high technology  i used to think that
 reason and logic and relentless drive were the only
  only ways to make things happen  and before i worked with the kids anything that i did with them 
 or anything that i did with with myself was supposed to be perfect  ideal  optimal
  but after working with them for
 some time i discovered the great virtues of empathy and
  being able to start with some vision and if the vision doesn 't work  well nothing happened all you have to do is play with it change it a little bit 
 and come up with something that does help that does work 
 so right now i feel more like
 these are my principles  and if you don 't like them  i have others
  focus before each ride
 we sit together with the kids and we give them one word to think about
 during the ride you have to focus their attention on something
 because so many things happen so these are words like teamwork or endurance or even complicated concepts
  word that they don 't understand you know perspective is one of these critically important life coping strategies
 that mountain biking can really teach you i tell kids when they struggle through some uphill
 and feel like they cannot take it anymore  
 it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows it literally propels you upwards
 that 's what perspective is all about or you can also look back in time and realize that you 've already conquered steeper mountains before 
 and that 's how they develop  self esteem now let me give you an example of how it works you stand with your bike
 at the beginning of february it 's very cold and you 're standing in one of these rainy
  cold and chilly  and you 're standing in let 's say yokneam  and you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see
 the monastery at the top of the muhraka that 's where you 're supposed to climb now  and you say there 's no way that i could possibly get there 
 and yet two hours later
 you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery
  everything is so small and tiny  and you say hey alex look at this parking lot where we started it 's that big i can 't believe that i did it 
 and that 's the point
 when you start loving yourself  and so we talked about these special words that we teach them and at the end of
  we sit together
 and share moments in which those special words of the day
 popped up and made a difference 
 and these discussions can be extremely inspiring in one of them one of the kids once said when we were riding on this ridge overlooking
 the dead sea
 and he 's talking about this spot here i was reminded of the day when i left my village in ethiopia and went away together with my brother
 one hundred and twenty kilometers until we reached sudan this was the first place where we got some water and supplies 
 and he goes on saying and everyone looks at him like a hero probably for the first time in his life  
 and he says
 because i also have volunteers riding with me  adults  who are sitting there listening to him
 and he says
  and this was just the beginning of of our
 ordeal until we ended up in israel  and only now he says i 'm beginning to to understand where i am and i actually like it 
 now i remember when he said it i felt goosebumps on my body because he said it overlooking the moab mountains here in the background that 's where
 joshua descended and crossed the jordan and led the people of of israel into the land of canaan three thousand years ago in this final leg of
  the journey from africa  and so perspective and context and history
 play key roles in the way i plan my rides
 with the kids we visit kibbutzim that were established by holocaust survivors we
 explore
 ruins of palestinian villages  and we discuss how they became
 ruins  and we go through numerous remnants of jewish settlements nabatic settlements  canaanite settlements
  years old  and through this tapestry  which is the history of this country the kids
 acquire what is probably the most important value in education  and that is the understanding that life is complex
 and there 's no black and white and by appreciating complexity they become more tolerant  and tolerance
 leads to hope 
 i ride with these kids once a week  every tuesday here 's a picture i took last tuesday less than a week ago and i ride with them tomorrow
  end up standing in one of these incredible locations  taking in this incredible landscape around me  and i feel
 blessed and fortunate that i 'm alive  and that i sense every fiber in my aching body  and i feel blessed and fortunate
 that fifteen years ago i had the courage to resign my tenured position at nyu and return to my home country where
  of of troubled kids coming from ethiopia and
 morocco and russia  and i feel blessed and fortunate that every week every tuesday and actually every friday also
 i can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in israel on the edge
