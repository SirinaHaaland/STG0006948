  evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form 
 from mother to daughter preacher to congregant  teacher to pupil storyteller to audience whether in cave paintings or the
  latest uses of the internet human beings have always told their histories and truths
 through parable and fable we are inveterate storytellers  
 but where 
 in our increasingly secular and fragmented world do we offer communality of experience  
 unmediated by our own furious consumerism 
  narrative what history  what identity  what moral code
 are we imparting to our young 
 cinema is arguably the 20th century 's most influential art form 
 its artists told stories across national boundaries 
 in as many languages genres and philosophies as one can imagine indeed it is hard to find a subject that film
  has yet to tackle  
 during the last decade we 've seen a vast integration of global media now dominated by a culture of the hollywood blockbuster 
 we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation not story is king 
 what was common to us all forty years ago
 the telling of stories between generations is now rarified as a filmmaker it worried me as a human
  being it puts the fear of god in me what future could the young build with so little grasp
 of where they 've come from and so few narratives of what 's possible 
 the irony is palpable technical access has never been greater cultural access never weaker 
 and so
 in two thousand and six we set up filmclub an
  organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions 
 if we could raid the annals of one hundred years of film maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young 
 given the access to technology even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a dvd
 onto a white board
 in the first nine months we ran twenty five clubs across the u k 
 with kids in age groups between five and eighteen watching a film uninterrupted for ninety minutes 
 the films were curated and contextualized but the choice was theirs  and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could
  it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind 
 in groups as large as one hundred and fifty and as small as three these young people discovered new places new thoughts  new perspectives 
 by the time the pilot had finished 
 we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join
  a remarkable comment on slums  poverty and aspiration 
 i had seen the film on the occasion of my father 's 50th birthday  
 technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema find and pay for the print and the projectionist but for my father
  the emotional and artistic importance of de sica 's vision
 was so great
 that he chose to celebrate his half century with his three teenage children and thirty of their friends in order he said 
 to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation 
 in the last shot of miracle in milan  slum dwellers float skyward on flying brooms sixty years after the film was made and thirty
  years after i first saw it 
 i see young faces tilt up in awe their incredulity matching mine and the speed with which they associate it with slumdog millionaire or the favelas in rio speaks to the enduring nature 
 in a filmclub season about democracy and government we screened mr smith goes
  the film is older than most of our members ' grandparents
 frank capra 's classic values independence and propriety it shows how to do right how to be heroically awkward it is also an expression of faith
 in the political machine as a force of honor shortly after mr smith became a filmclub classic 
  in the house of lords and it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was
 and why the lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle 
 after all jimmy stewart filibustered for two entire reels 
 in choosing hotel rwanda they explored genocide of the most brutal kind it provoked tears as well as incisive
  questions about unarmed  peace keeping forces and the double dealing of a western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind  
 and when schindler 's list demanded that they never forget one child full of the pain of consciousness  remarked we already forgot  
  as they watch more films their lives got palpably richer pickpocket started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement 
 to sir with love ignited its teen audience they celebrated a change in attitude towards non white britons  
 but railed against our restless school system that does not value
  unlike that
 offered by sidney poitier 's careful tutelage 
 by now these thoughtful opinionated curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms black and white subtitled documentary non narrative fantasy
 and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate
  and increasingly sophisticated prose 
 six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week 
 from twenty five clubs we became hundreds then thousands 
 until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in seven thousand clubs right across the country 
 and although the numbers were and continue to be extraordinary what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning
 translated into life some of our kids started talking with their parents  others with their teachers or with their friends and those without friends
 started making them the films provided communality across all manner of divide and the stories they held provided a shared
  brought a daughter closer to her iranian mother 
 and jaws became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he 'd experienced in flight from violence
 that killed first his father
 then his mother the latter thrown overboard
 on a boat journey 
 who was right who wrong what would they do under the same conditions was the tale told well was there a hidden message how has the world
  changed how could it be different 
 a tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn 't think were interested and they themselves had not known they cared 
 and as they wrote and debated  
 rather than seeing the films as artifacts 
 they began to see themselves
  i have an aunt
 who is a wonderful storyteller in a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on table mountain and playing cops and robbers  quite recently she told me that
 in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to israel without my grandparents 
 when the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions  it was these teenagers
  i was past forty when my father died he never mentioned that journey my mother 's mother
 left europe in a hurry
 without her husband but with her three year old daughter
 and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt 
 after two years in hiding my grandfather appeared in london he was never right again  and his story was hushed
 as he assimilated 
  story
 started in england with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents  
 i had anne frank the great escape shoah triumph of the will 
 it was leni riefenstahl in her elegant nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure 
 these films held
 what was too hurtful to say out
  loud  and they became more useful to me
 than the whispers of survivors
 and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt 's wrist 
 purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history  or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth
 but within the reels lie purpose and meaning 
 as one 12 year old said after watching wizard of oz 
 every person should watch this because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart 
 we honor reading why not honor watching with the same passion
  as valuable as jane austen agree that boyz n the hood like tennyson  offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together  each a piece of memorable art 
 each a brick in the wall of who we are 
 and it 's okay if we remember tom hanks better than astronaut jim lovell or have ben kingsley 's face
 superimposed onto that of gandhi 's and though not real  eve harrington howard beale
  mildred pierce
 are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human and no less helpful to understanding our life and times
 as shakespeare is in illuminating the world of elizabethan england 
 we guessed that film whose stories are a meeting place of drama music literature and human experience would engage and inspire the young people participating in
  filmclub what we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior confidence and academic achievement
  students now race to school talk to their teachers fight not on the playground but to choose next week 's film young people who have found 
 ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have
  witnessed our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young they are neither feral
 nor myopically 
 they are like other young people negotiating a world with infinite choice  
 but little culture of how to find meaningful experience  
 we appeared surprised at the behaviors
 of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered 
 if we want different values we have to tell a different story 
 a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person 's identity that a collective narrative is an essential
  component of a cultural identity  and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group  because when these people
 get home after a screening of rear window and raise their gaze to the building next door they have the tools to wonder who 
 apart from them is out there
 and what is their story
