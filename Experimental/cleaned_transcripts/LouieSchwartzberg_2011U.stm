  it 's great being here at ted 
 you know i think there might be some presentations that will go over my head but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet 
 the little things
  in life 
 sometimes that we forget about like pollination that we take for granted  
 and you can 't tell the story about pollinators bees bats hummingbirds butterflies
 without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how 
 over fifty million years  i 've been filming time lapse flowers twenty four hours a day  seven days a week for over
  to watch them move is a dance i 'm never going to get tired of it fills me with wonder and it opens my heart 
 beauty and seduction i believe is nature 's tool for survival  because we will protect what we fall in love with 
 their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth 
 it reminds us that we are a part of nature
  and we 're not separate from it 
 when i heard about the vanishing bees colony collapse disorder  it motivated me to take action 
 we depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat  
 and many scientists believe it 's the most serious issue facing mankind 
 it 's like the canary in the coalmine  if they disappear so do we 
 it reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it
  what motivated me to film their behavior
 was something that i asked my scientific advisers what motivates the pollinators 
 well  their answer was it 's all about risk and reward
  's all about sex and
 chip taylor  our monarch butterfly expert he replied 
 nothing lasts forever  everything in the universe wears out and that blew my mind because i realized that nature
 had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward  as a life force that passes right through
  us
 and makes us a link in the evolution of life  
 rarely seen by the naked eye  this intersection between the animal world and the plant world
 is truly a magic moment it 's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself over and over again 
 so here is some nectar from my film  i hope you 'll drink
 and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden  
 and always take time to smell the flowers and let it fill you with beauty and rediscover
 that sense of wonder here are some images from
 the
