  we should ask ourselves the question why does poverty exist  i mean there is plenty of knowledge and
 scientific breakthroughs we all live in the same planet but there 's still a great deal of poverty in the world  and i think
 so i want to throw a perspective that i have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see
  see whether it 's contributing or
 contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it 
 rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last sixty years  and by and large this has failed and
 you can see this book written by someone who worked in the world bank for twenty years  
  economic growth in this country to be elusive by and large it did not work so the question is why is that 
 in my mind  there is something to learn from the history of europe  i mean  
 even here  yesterday i was walking across the street and they showed
 three bishops were executed five hundred years ago right across the street
  so my point is there 's a lot of struggle has gone in europe where citizens were empowered by technologies  
 and they demanded authorities from to come down from their high horses  
 and in the end there 's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens 
 and democracies capitalism everything else flourished  
 and so you can see the real process of and
 this is backed up by this
  came down
 and citizens got up  
 but if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last sixty years aid actually did the opposite 
 it empowered authorities and as a result  marginalized citizens the authorities did not have
 the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people
 and make make more money for to run their business because they were getting it from abroad  
 and in fact if you see oil rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes
 nigeria saudi arabia all sorts of countries because the aid and oil or mineral money
 acts the same way it empowers authorities without activating the
  citizens their hands legs  brains what have you and if you
 if you agree with that then i think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize
 that economic development is of the people by the people for the people 
 and that is the real network effect if citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard
  then things would improve and
 to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the world bank is an organization of the government by the government for the governments 
  just see the contrast and that is the perspective i have and
  and one is cell phones recently the economist recognized this but i stumbled stumbled upon the idea twelve years ago  and
 that 's what i 've been working on  
 so twelve years ago i was trying to be an investment banker in new york we had
  our colleagues were connected by a computer network and
 we got more productive because
 we didn 't have to exchange floppy disks we could update each other more more often but one time it broke down and it reminded me of a day 
 there was a war going on in my country  and my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural
  area
 where it was safer  and
 one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling  and i walked
 ten miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man  and he wasn 't there so i walked all afternoon back 
 so i had another unproductive day  so while i was sitting in a tall building in new york  i put those two experiences together side by side
  and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity whether it 's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village  so naturally  i
 the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon
 against poverty  and if that 's the case then
 the question is how many telephones did we have at that time  and it turns out that there was one telephone in
  bangladesh for every five hundred people 
 and all those phones were in the few urban places  the vast rural areas where one hundred million people lived there were no telephones  
 so just imagine how many
  are wasted just like i wasted a day  if you just multiply by one hundred million
  's say losing one day a month  whatever  
 and you see a vast amount of resource wasted and after all poor countries like rich countries one thing we 've got equal is their days are the same length twenty four hours  so if you lose
 that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries that 's a huge waste  
 so i started looking for any evidence that does connectivity really
 increase productivity
  i couldn 't find much really but i found this
 graph
 produced by the itu which is the international telecommunication union
  based in geneva they show an interesting thing that you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country  so the united states or the uk would be here  outside  
 and so the impact of one new telephone which is on the
  on the vertical axis is very little very little  
 but if you come back to a poorer country  
 where the gnp per capita is let 's say five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars then the impact is huge six thousand dollars 
 or five thousand dollars the question was how much did it cost
  to install a new telephone in bangladesh  it turns out two thousand dollars  so if you spend two thousand dollars 
 and let 's say the telephone lasts ten years  and if five thousand dollars every year
 so that 's fifty thousand dollars  so obviously this was a gadget to have  
 and of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there 's a digital revolution going on then it would be even
  and i knew a little economics by then
 it says
 adam smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity  but how would you specialize  let 's say i 'm a fisherman and a farmer  and
 chris is a fisherman farmer both are generalists  so
 the point is that we could only the only way we could
  if we can connect with each other  
 and if we are neighbors i could just walk over to his house  
 but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area  
 but in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone lines  but
 in any event it 's connectivity that leads to dependability and that leads to specialization that leads to productivity  
 so the question was i started looking at this issue
 and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york there were a lot of
 reasons people told me why we don 't have enough telephones  
 and one of them is the lacking buying power poor people apparently don 't have the power to buy  
 but the point is if it 's a production tool  why do we have to worry about that i mean in america people buy
  and they put very little money down they get a car  and they go to work the work pays them a salary the salary allows them to pay for the car over time the car pays for itself  so if the telephone is a production tool  
 then we don 't quite have to worry about the purchasing power  
 and of course even if that 's true  then
 what about initial buying
  question is why can 't we have some kind of shared access in the united states we have
 everybody needs a banking service but very few of us are trying to buy a bank  
 so it 's a bank tends to serve a whole community  so we could do that for telephones  and also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet
  be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money
  but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures 
 see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing for instance the internet was booming in the u s 
 because there were there were people who had computers
  they had modems  they had
 telephone lines  so it 's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet  
 but that 's what 's lacking in a poor country  so for example we didn 't have ways to have credit checks 
 few banks to collect bills etc  but that 's why i noticed grameen bank which is a bank for poor people and had one thousand 
 one hundred branches twelve thousand employees two point three million borrowers  and
 they had these branches i thought i could
  put cell towers and create a network and anyway to cut the time short
 so i started i first went to them and said you
 know perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient but you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized i
 there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons they had to be 
 and so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and then to be and rock the boat  so i
 started focusing what is it that they really do 
 so what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank she typically buys a cow the cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan
  this is a business for her  but it 's milk for everybody else and suddenly i realized that a cell phone could be a cow because some way she could borrow
 two hundred dollars from the bank 
 get a phone and have the phone for everybody and it 's a business for her  so i wrote to the bank  and
 they thought for a while and they said it 's a
 little crazy but logical if you think it can be done come and make it happen so i quit my job i went back to
  bangladesh  i created a company in america called gonofone which in bengali means people 's phone 
 and angel investors in america put in money into that i flew around the world 
 after about a million i mean i got rejected from lots of places  because i was not only trying to go to a poor country i was trying to go to the poor of the poor country  after about a million miles 
  substantial loss of hair i eventually put together a
 consortium  and which involved the norwegian telephone company  which provided the know how and the grameen bank
 provided the infrastructure to
 to spread the service to make the story short here is the coverage of the country you can see it 's pretty much covered
 even in bangladesh there are some empty places  but we are also
 investing around another three hundred million dollars this year
 to extend that coverage  now about that cow model i talked about there are about one hundred
 and fifteen thousand people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods  and it 's serving
  thousand villages which represent about eighty million people and these these phones
 are generating about one hundred million dollars for the company  and two dollars profit per
 per entrepreneur per day  which is like seven hundred dollars per year
  and of course it 's very beneficial in a lot of ways it increases income improves welfare 
  result is right now this company is
 is the largest telephone company with three point five million subscribers one
 hundred and fifteen thousand of these phones i talked about that produces about a third of the traffic in the network 
 and two thousand and four the net profit after taxes very serious taxes
 was one hundred and twenty million dollars  and the company contributed about one hundred and ninety million dollars
 to the government coffers  and again  here are some of the lessons
 the government needs to provide economically viable services actually this is an instance where private companies can
 provide that governments need to subsidize private companies this is what some people think and actually private companies help governments with taxes 
 poor people are recipients poor people are a resource 
 services cost too much for the poor their involvement reduces the cost the poor are uneducated and cannot do much
  they are very eager learners and very capable survivors i 've been very surprised most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day 
 poor countries need aid businesses this one company
 has raised the if the ideal figures are even five percent true this one company
  is raising the gnp of the country much more
 than the aid the country receives and as i was trying to show you as far as i 'm concerned aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens 
 and this is a new project i have with dean kamen the famous inventor in america he has produced some
 power generators  which we are now doing an experiment in bangladesh in two villages where cow manure is
  producing biogas  which is running these generators and each of these generators
 is selling electricity to twenty houses each it 's just an experiment we don 't know how far it will go
