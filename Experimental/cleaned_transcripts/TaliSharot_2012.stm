  'm going to talk to you about optimism
 or more precisely the optimism bias  it 's a cognitive illusion that we 've been studying in my lab for the past few years  and eighty percent of us have it it
 's our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing good events in our
  and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events  
 so we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer being in a car accident we overestimate our longevity our career prospects  
 in short we 're more optimistic than realistic but we are oblivious to the fact 
 take marriage for example in the western world divorce rates are about forty percent  that means that out of
  five married couples two will end up splitting their assets but when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce they estimate it at zero percent 
 and even divorce lawyers who should really know better  hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce  
 so it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce  but they are more likely to remarry
  in the words of samuel johnson remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience 
 so if we 're married we 're more likely to have kids  and we all think our kids will be especially talented  this by the way is my
 two year old nephew guy  and i just want to make it absolutely clear that he 's a really bad example of the optimism bias  because he is in fact uniquely
  talented 
 and i 'm not alone out of four british people three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families that 's seventy five percent  
 but only thirty percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago  
 and this is a really important point because we 're optimistic about ourselves we 're optimistic about our kids
  're optimistic about our families  
 but we 're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us and we 're somewhat pessimistic about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country  
 but private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent  
 and it doesn 't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay  but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so
 now i 'm a scientist i do experiments so to show you what i mean i 'm going to do an experiment here with you   
 so i 'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics  
 and i want you to think for each of these abilities where you stand relative to the rest of the population 
 the first one is getting along well with others who here believes they 're at the bottom
 twenty five percent
 okay that 's about ten people out of one thousand five hundred  who believes they 're at the top twenty five percent
 that 's most of us here okay now do the same for your driving ability  
 how interesting are you how attractive are you
  how honest are you  and finally how modest are you  
 so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities 
 now this is statistically impossible we can 't all be better than everyone else 
 but
 if we believe we 're better than the other guy well that means that we 're more likely to get that promotion
 to remain married because we 're more social more interesting  
 and it 's a global phenomenon 
 the optimism bias has been observed in many different countries in western cultures in non western cultures  in females and males in kids in the elderly  
 it 's quite widespread  but the question is 
  is it good for us 
 so some people say no some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations 
 i think the logic goes something like this 
 if we don 't expect greatness if we don 't expect to find love and be healthy and successful well we 're not going to be disappointed when these things don 't happen  
 and if we 're not disappointed when good things don 't happen and we 're pleasantly surprised when they do we will be happy  
 so it 's a very good theory
  it turns out to be wrong for three reasons  number one  
 whatever happens  whether you succeed or you fail people with high expectations always feel better  
 because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month
 depends on how we interpret that event  the psychologists margaret marshall and john brown studied students with high and low
  expectations 
 and they found that when people with high expectations succeed they attribute that success to their own traits 
 i 'm a genius  therefore i got an a therefore i 'll get an a again and again in the future 
 when they failed it wasn 't because they were dumb  but because the exam just happened to be unfair  next time they will do better
  people with low expectations do the opposite  so when they failed it was because they were dumb  and when they succeeded it was because the exam just happened to be really easy next time reality would catch up with them  
 so they felt worse  
 number two  regardless of the outcome  the pure act of anticipation makes us happy  
 the behavioral economist
  george lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity  any celebrity  then he said 
 how much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately  
 in three hours in twenty four hours  in three days  in one year in ten years  
 he found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately  but to get a kiss in three days
 they were willing to pay extra in order to wait
  now they weren 't willing to wait a year or ten years  no one wants an aging celebrity but three days
 seemed to be
 the optimum amount  so why is that 
 well if you get the kiss now it 's over and done with but if you get the kiss in three days  well that 's three days of jittery anticipation the thrill
  the wait the students wanted that time to imagine where is it going to happen  how is it going to happen  anticipation made them happy  
 this is by the way why people prefer friday to sunday  it 's a really curious fact because
 friday is a day of work and sunday is a day of pleasure so you 'd assume that people will
  they don 't  
 it 's not because they really really like being in the office and they can 't stand strolling in the park or having a lazy brunch  we know that because when you ask people about their ultimate 
  favorite day of the week  surprise surprise  saturday comes in at first then friday then sunday  
  all the plans that you have on sunday  the only thing you can look forward to is the work week  
 so optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future 
 more strolls in the park and that anticipation enhances their wellbeing 
 in fact  without the optimism bias  we would all be slightly depressed people with
  they don 't have a bias when they look into the future they 're actually more realistic than
 healthy individuals 
 but individuals with severe depression they have a pessimistic bias so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being  
 so optimism changes subjective reality the way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it  but it also
  and that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy
  controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success  it leads to success 
 optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics  and maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism
 is health if we expect the future to be bright
  and anxiety are reduced  
 so all in all optimism has lots of benefits  but the question that was really confusing to me was how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality  
 as an neuroscientist this was especially confusing because according to all the theories out
  when your expectations are not met you should alter them but this is not what we find we asked people to come into our lab
 in order to try and figure out what was going on 
 we asked them to estimate their likelihood of experiencing different terrible events in their lives  so for example what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer  
 and then we told them the average likelihood of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes  so cancer for example is about thirty percent
 and then we asked them again how likely are you to suffer from cancer 
 what we wanted to know was whether people will take the information that we gave them to change their beliefs  and indeed they did
 but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they
  so for example if someone said my likelihood of suffering from cancer is about fifty percent and we said hey good news  the average likelihood is only thirty percent 
 the next time around they would say well maybe my likelihood is about thirty five percent so they learned quickly and efficiently  
 but if someone started off saying my average likelihood of suffering from cancer is
  bad news the average likelihood is about thirty percent the next time around they would say yep still think it 's about eleven percent 
 so it 's not that they didn 't learn at all they did
 but much much less than when we gave them positive information about the future  and it 's not that they didn 't remember the numbers that we gave them
  everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about thirty percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about forty percent  
 but they didn 't think that those numbers were related to them 
 what this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact  
 yes smoking kills but mostly it kills the other guy  
 what i wanted to know
  what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally  but at the same time when we hear that the housing market is hopeful  we think oh my house is definitely going to double in price 
 to try and figure that out i asked the participants in the experiment to lie in a brain imaging scanner  it looks like this  
 and using a method called
  we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information 
 one of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus  
 so if someone said my likelihood of suffering from cancer is fifty percent and we said hey good news average likelihood is thirty percent 
 the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely  
 and it didn 't matter if you 're an extreme
  a mild optimist or slightly pessimistic 
 everyone 's left inferior frontal gyrus was functioning perfectly well whether you 're barack obama or woody allen 
 on the other side of the brain the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news  and here 's the thing  
 it wasn 't doing a very good job  the more optimistic you were the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information
 if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future you will constantly leave your rose tinted spectacles on  
 so we wanted to know could we change this could we alter people 's optimism bias
 by interfering with the brain activity in these regions and there 's a way for us to do that
  this is my collaborator ryota kanai  
 and what he 's doing is he 's passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus  
 and by doing that he 's interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour  after that everything goes back to normal i assure you 
 so let 's see what happens
  first of all i 'm going to show you the average amount of bias that we see so if i was to
 test all of you now this is the amount that you would learn more from good news relative to bad news  
 now we interfere with the region that we found to integrate negative information in this task  
 and the optimism bias grew even larger  
 we made people more biased
 in the way that they process information 
 then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task  and the optimism bias disappeared  
 we were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep rooted bias in
  we stopped and we asked ourselves 
 would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits if we could do that would we want to take people 's optimism bias away  
 well i 've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life 
  be really foolish of us to ignore them  
 take for example this email i recieved from a firefighter here in california  he says fatality investigations for firefighters often include  ' we didn 't think the fire was going to do that '
 even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions 
 this captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias to try to explain to the firefighters
  why they think the way they do to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic
 bias in humans  so unrealistic optimism
 can lead to risky behavior to financial collapse to faulty planning  the british government for example
  has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects  
 so they have adjusted the two thousand and twelve olympic budget for the optimism bias  
 my friend who 's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget 
 and by the way when i asked him about his own likelihood of divorce he said he was quite sure it was zero percent
 so what we would really like to do
  is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism  
 but at the same time remain hopeful  benefiting from the many fruits of optimism  
 and i believe there 's a way for us to do that 
 the key here really is knowledge we 're not born with an innate understanding of our biases these have to be identified by scientific investigation  
 but the good news is that becoming
  aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion it 's like visual illusions in which understanding them does not make them go away  and this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance 
 to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism but at the same time remain hopeful
  i think this
 cartoon portrays it nicely because
 if you 're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly you certainly never will 
 because to make any kind of progress we need to be able to imagine a different reality  and then we need to believe that that reality is possible  
 but if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps
 down blindly hoping for the best you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground  
 but if you 're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly but then adjusts a parachute to your back
 just in case things don 't work out exactly as you had planned you will soar like an eagle  even if you 're just a penguin
 thank you
