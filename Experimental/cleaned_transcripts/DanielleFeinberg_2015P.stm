  when i was seven years old some well meaning adult asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up proudly
  in search of a new dream  eventually settling on being a scientist  perhaps something like the next albert einstein 
 i have always loved math and science later coding and so i decided to study computer programming in college 
 in my junior year my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films  
 it was the first computer animation any of
  had ever seen i watched these films in wonder transfixed fireworks going off in my head thinking that is what i want to do with my life 
 the idea that all the math science and code i had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories i connected with was pure magic for me 
 just two years later i started working at the place that made those films  pixar animation
  studios  it was here i learned how we actually execute those films to create our movies we create a three dimensional world inside the computer 
 we start with a point that makes a line that makes a face
 that creates characters or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest 
 and because it 's a three dimensional world we can move a camera around inside that world  
 i was fascinated by all of it
 but then i got my first taste of lighting 
 lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three dimensional world  i actually have icons of lights i move around in there here you can see i 've added a light  i 'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software turn on shadows and placing the light  
 as i place a light  i think about what it might look like in real life  but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story
 so it might look like this at first  but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work 
 in rough form it might look like this 
 and in final form like this
  there 's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it it 's where we go from this to
  this it 's the moment where all the pieces come together and suddenly the world comes to life as if it 's an actual place that exists 
 this moment never gets old especially for that little seven year old girl that wanted to be an artist  
 as i learned to light i learned about using light to help tell story 
 to set the time of day 
 to create the mood
  to guide the audience 's eye  how to make a character look appealing
 or stand out in a busy set 
 did you see wall e 
 there he is 
 as you can see we can create any world that we want inside the computer  we can make a world with monsters 
 with robots that fall in love  we can even make pigs fly
 while this is an incredible thing this untethered artistic freedom  it can create chaos  
 it can create
 unbelievable worlds unbelievable movement things that are jarring to the audience 
 so to combat this we tether ourselves with science  we use science and the world we know as a backbone
  ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable 
 finding nemo is an excellent example of this a major portion of the movie takes place underwater  but how do you make it look underwater 
 in early research and development we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer 
 then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look 
 one of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water
 so we coded up a light that mimics this physics first the visibility of the water  and then what happens with the color 
 objects close to the eye have their full rich colors  as light travels deeper into the water  we lose the red wavelengths then the green wavelengths leaving us with blue at the far depths 
 in this clip you can see two other important elements the first is the surge and swell
  the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water  
 the second is the caustics 
 these are the ribbons of light like you might see on the bottom of a pool that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean 's surface 
 here we have the fog beams these give us color depth cues but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don 't see the water surface the
  other really cool thing you can see here is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics so that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light it appears and disappears  lending a subtle magical sparkle to the underwater 
 you can see how we 're using the science the physics of water light and movement to tether that
  but we are not beholden to it we considered each of these elements and which ones had to be scientifically accurate
 and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood 
 we realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with so here 's a traditionally colored underwater scene  
 but here we can take sydney harbor and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what 's happening 
 in this scene it 's really important we see deep into the underwater  so we understand what the east
  australian current is that the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride  so we pushed the visibility of the water well past anything you would ever see in real life  
 because in the end we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world we 're trying to create a believable world one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story  
 we use science to create something wonderful
 we use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder  
 this guy wall e is a great example of that he finds beauty in the simplest things  but when he came in to lighting we knew we had a big problem  
 we got so geeked out on making wall e this convincing robot that we made his binoculars practically optically
  his binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has he doesn 't have a face or even traditional dialogue for that matter  
 so the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions  
 we started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections 
 he was starting to look
  thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he 's capable of falling in love  
 so we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars 
 trying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials but solve this reflection problem  
 so we started with the lenses here 's the flat front lens  we have a concave lens and a convex lens and here you see all three together showing us all these
  reflections  we tried turning them down  we tried blocking them nothing was working 
 you can see here sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes usually eve  so we couldn 't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses  
 so here we have eve on the first lens  we put eve on the second lens  it 's not working  we turn it down  it 's still not working  
 and then we have
  our eureka moment we add a light to wall e that accidentally leaks into his eyes you can see it light up these gray aperture blades 
 suddenly those aperture blades are poking through that reflection the way nothing else has  
 now we recognize wall e as having an eye  as humans we have the white of our eye  the colored iris and the black pupil
  now wall e has the black of an eye  the gray aperture blades and the black pupil  
 suddenly  wall e feels like he has a soul like there 's a character with emotion inside 
 later in the movie towards the end wall e loses his personality essentially going dead this is the perfect time to bring back that
  scene wall e comes back to life  we bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back 
 and he returns to that sweet soulful robot we 've come to love wall e
 there 's a beauty in these unexpected moments when
 when you find the key to unlocking a robot 's soul  the moment when you discover what you want to do with your life  
 the jellyfish in finding nemo was one of those moments for me 
 there are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together this was one of those scenes 
 the director had a vision for this scene based on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the south pacific  
 as we went along  we were floundering  the reviews with the director turned from the normal
 look and feel conversation into more and more questions about
 numbers and percentages 
 maybe because unlike normal we were basing it on something in real life  or maybe just because we had lost our way  
 but it had become about using our brain without our eyes  the science without the art 
 that scientific tether was
  but even through all the frustrations i still believed it could be beautiful so when it came in to lighting  i dug in 
 as i worked to balance the blues and the pinks the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells the undulating fog beams 
 something promising began to appear  
 i came in one morning and checked the previous night 's work  and i got excited  and then i showed it to the lighting director and she got excited
  i was showing to the director in a dark room full of fifty people 
 in director review you hope you might get some nice words then you get some notes and fixes generally  
 and then hopefully you get a final signaling to move on to the next stage  i gave my intro  and i played the jellyfish scene 
 and the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time
  just long enough for me to think oh no  this is doomed 
 and then he started clapping  
 and then the production designer started clapping  
 and then the whole room was clapping  
 this
  is the moment that i live for in lighting the moment where it all comes together and we get a world that we can believe in  
 we use math science and code to create these amazing worlds  we use storytelling and art to bring them to life  
 it 's this interweaving
 of art and science
 that elevates the world to a place of wonder a place with soul a place we can believe in 
 a place where the things you imagine can become
  real
 and a world where a girl suddenly realizes not only is she a scientist  but also an artist  thank you
