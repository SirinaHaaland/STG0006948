  i felt a funeral in my brain  and mourners to and fro
 kept treading treading till [ it seemed ] that sense was breaking through
 and when they all were seated
  service like a drum kept beating beating till i [ thought ] my mind was going numb
 and then i heard them lift a box and creak across my soul with those same boots of lead again  then space began to toll 
 as [ all ] the heavens were a bell
  a plank in reason broke  and i fell down and down and hit a world at every plunge  and finished knowing
 then 
 we know depression through metaphors
  emily dickinson was able to convey it in language  goya
 in an image half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states 
 as for me i had always thought myself tough one of the people who could survive if i 'd been sent to a concentration camp 
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i had a series of losses my
  a relationship i 'd been in ended  i moved back to the united states from some years abroad  
 and i got through all of those experiences intact  
 but in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four three years later  i found myself losing interest in almost everything 
 i didn 't want to do any of the things i had previously wanted to do and i didn 't know why  the opposite of
  and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me
 in that moment everything there was to do seemed like too much work 
 i would come home and i would see the red light flashing on my answering machine  and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends i would think 
 what a lot of people that is to have to call back 
  i would decide i should have lunch and then i would think but i 'd have to get the food out
 and put it on a plate and cut it up
 and chew it
 and swallow it and it felt to me like the stations of the cross  
 and one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it 's ridiculous  you know it 's ridiculous while you 're experiencing it  you know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize
  themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it 's not a big deal  and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it 
 and so i began to feel myself doing less
 and thinking less
 and feeling less it was a kind of nullity  and then the anxiety set in if you
  told me that i 'd have to be depressed for the next month  i would say as long i know it 'll be over in november i can do it 
 but if you said to me you have to have acute anxiety for the next month 
 i would rather slit my wrist than go through it it was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you 're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you but instead of lasting half a second the way that does it lasted for six months
 it 's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you 're afraid of 
 and it was at that point that i began to think that it was just too painful
 to be alive and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people and finally
 one day i woke up and i thought perhaps i 'd had a stroke because i lay in bed completely frozen  looking at the telephone thinking something is wrong
 and i should call for help 
 and i couldn 't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial  
 and finally after four full hours of my lying and staring at it the phone rang  and somehow i managed to pick it up 
  i 'm in serious trouble we need to do something the next day
 i started with the medications and the therapy  
 and i also started reckoning with this terrible question 
 if i 'm not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp  then who am i  
 and if i have to take medication is that medication making me more fully myself 
 or is it making me someone else
  else and how do i feel about it
 if it 's making me someone else  
 i had two advantages as i went into the fight 
 the first is that i knew that objectively speaking  i had a nice life  and that if i could only get well  there was something at the other end that was worth living for 
 and the other was that i had access to good treatment
 but i nonetheless emerged and relapsed
  and emerged and relapsed  and emerged
 and relapsed  and finally understood
 i would have to be on medication and in therapy forever  
 and i thought but is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem and does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure and i couldn 't figure out which it was  and then i understood that actually we aren 't advanced
  enough in either area for it to explain things fully the chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play  and i also figured out
  that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality  
  they 're extremely costly  they come with innumerable side effects they 're a disaster  
 but i am so grateful that i live now and not fifty years ago when there would have been almost nothing to be done 
 i hope that fifty years hence people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science 
 depression
 is the flaw
  flaw in love 
 if you were married to someone and thought well  if my wife dies i 'll find another one 
 it wouldn 't be love as we know it  
 there 's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss 
 and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy  
 there are three things people tend to
  confuse depression  grief and sadness  grief
 is explicitly reactive 
 if you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy and then six months later you are still deeply sad but you 're functioning a little better  it 's probably grief 
 and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure if you experience a catastrophic loss and you feel
  terrible and six months later you can barely function at all then it 's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances  the trajectory tells us a great deal 
 people think of depression as being just sadness  it 's much much too much sadness much too much grief
 at far too slight a cause as i set out to understand depression
 and to interview people who had experienced it  i found that there were people who seemed on the surface to have what sounded like relatively mild depression
 who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it 
 and there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes  
 and i set out to find
  out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people what are the mechanisms that allow people to survive  and i went out and i interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression  
 one of the first people i interviewed described depression
 as a slower way of being
  and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness that this is a serious business it 's the leading disability worldwide and people die of it every day 
 one of the people i talked to when i was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who i had known for many years and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college  and then plummeted into a horrific
  depression  she had bipolar illness or manic depression as it was then known  
 and then she did very well for many years on lithium  and then eventually  she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it  and she had another 
  psychosis  and then plunged into the worst depression that i had ever seen in which she sat in her parents ' apartment 
  essentially without moving day after day after day  
 and when i interviewed her about that experience some years later she 's a poet and psychotherapist named maggie robbins
 when i interviewed her she said 
 i was singing  ' where have all the flowers gone ' over and over to occupy my mind 
 i was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying which were
 ' you are nothing you are nobody you don 't even deserve to live ' and that was when i really started thinking
 about killing myself 
 you don 't think in depression that you 've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood 
 you think that the veil has been taken away the veil of happiness  and that now you 're seeing truly
  it 's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there 's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised  
 but it 's difficult with depressives  because we believe we are seeing the truth  
 but the truth lies 
 i became obsessed with that sentence but the truth
 lies
  and i discovered as i talked to depressive people that they have many delusional perceptions people will say no one loves me and you say i love you your wife loves you your mother loves you you can answer that one pretty readily at least for most people 
 but people who are depressed will also say no matter what we do we 're all just going to die in the end 
 or they 'll say there can be no true communion between two human beings each of us is trapped in his own body 
 to which you have to say
  true  but i think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast 
 a lot of the time 
 what they are expressing is not illness but insight  
 and one comes to think what 's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don 't distract us very much 
 there was a study i particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of
 were asked to play a video game for an hour  and at the end of the hour  they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed  
 the depressive group was usually accurate to within about ten percent  
 and the non depressed people guessed between fifteen and twenty times as many little monsters 
 as they had actually
  a lot of people said when i chose to write about my depression that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet to have people know they said do people talk to you differently 
 i said yes people talk to me differently  they talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience  or their sister 's experience or their friend 's experience 
  know my
 husband would never understand this he 's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn 't make any sense so
 you know it 's just between us and i said yes that 's fine on sunday of the same conference her husband took me aside 
 and he said my wife wouldn 't think that i was really much of a guy if she knew this but
 i 've been dealing with this depression and i 'm taking some medication
  wondered what you think they were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom 
 laughter and i said that i thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems 
 but i was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy depression is so exhausting
 it takes up so much of your time and energy  and silence about it  it really does make the depression worse  
 and then i began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better 
 i 'd started off as a medical conservative  i thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked it was clear what they were
 there was medication there were certain psychotherapies there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment and that everything else was
  nonsense but then i discovered something 
 if you have brain cancer  and you say that standing on your head for twenty minutes every morning makes you feel better  it may make you feel better  but you still have brain cancer and you 'll still probably die from it  
 but if you say that you have depression and standing on your head for twenty minutes every day makes you feel better 
  then it 's worked because depression is an illness of how you feel  and if you feel better  then you are effectively not depressed anymore 
 so i became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments 
 and i get letters i get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what 's worked for them someone was asking me backstage today about meditation my favorite of 
  the letters that i got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy medication she had tried pretty much everything
  and she had found a solution and hoped i would tell the world and that was making little things from yarn 
 she sent me some of them 
 laughter and i 'm not wearing them right now 
 i suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder
 in the dsm  and yet when i
  to look at alternative treatments i also gained perspective on other treatments 
 i went through a tribal exorcism in senegal that involved a great deal of ram 's blood and that i 'm not going to detail right now 
 but a few years afterwards i was in rwanda working on a different project  and i happened to describe my experience to someone and he said well that 's west africa and we 're in east africa and our rituals are in some ways very different but we do have some
  rituals that have something in common with what you 're describing  and he said but we 've had a lot of trouble with western mental health workers especially the ones who came right after the genocide 
 i said what kind of trouble did you have and he said well they
 would do this bizarre thing they didn 't take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better  they didn 't include drumming or music to get people 's blood going they didn 't involve the whole community they
  't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them
  the worst depression perhaps that i 've ever seen
 in a man  he was constantly depressed he was when i met him  at a point at which every month he would have electroshock treatment then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week then he would feel okay for a week  then he would
  a week of going downhill  and then he would have another electroshock treatment and he said to me when i met him it 's unbearable to go through my weeks this way i can 't go on this way  and 
 i 've figured out how i 'm going to end it if i don 't get better but he said to me i heard about a protocol at mass general for a procedure called a cingulotomy which is a brain surgery 
  and i think i 'm going to give that a try and i remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so
  many different treatments still had buried in him somewhere enough optimism to reach out for one more  
 and he had the cingulotomy and it was incredibly successful he 's now a friend of mine he has a lovely wife and two beautiful children  
 he wrote me a letter the christmas after the surgery  and he said my father sent me two presents this year first a motorized cd rack from the sharper image
  image that i didn 't really need  but i knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that i 'm living on my own and have a job i seem to love 
 and the other present was a photo of my grandmother who committed suicide  
 as i unwrapped it i began to cry  and my mother came over and said ' are you crying because of the relatives you never knew '
 and i said ' she had the same disease i have
  i 'm crying now as i write to you it 's not that i 'm so sad  but i get overwhelmed  
 i think because i could have killed myself but my parents kept me going  and so did the doctors  and i had the surgery  
 i 'm alive and grateful 
 we live in the right time  even if it doesn 't always
  i was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern western middle class thing  and i went to look at how it operated in a variety of 
  other contexts  and one of the things i was most interested in was depression among the indigent  and so i went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression and what i discovered 
  is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability
 which is presumably evenly distributed in the population and triggering circumstances  which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished  and yet it turns 
  out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time you think why do i feel like this i must have depression 
  and you feel miserable all the time  the way you feel is commensurate with your life  and it doesn 't occur to you to think maybe this is treatable and so we have an epidemic 
 in this country of depression among impoverished people that 's not being picked up and that 's not being treated and that 's not being addressed  
  she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression and then provided six months of the experimental protocol one of them  lolly came in and this is what she said the day she came in she said  
 and she was a woman by the way 
 who had seven children  she said  i used to have a job but i had to give it up because i couldn 't go out of the house 
 i have nothing to say to my children in the morning  i can 't wait for them to leave
 and then i climb in bed and pull the covers over my head  and three o 'clock when they come home it just comes so fast she said i 've been taking a lot of tylenol anything i can take 
  so that i can sleep more my husband has been telling me i 'm stupid  i 'm ugly  
 working in childcare
 for the u s navy  she had left the abusive husband  and she said to me 
 my kids are so much happier now 
 she said there 's one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls but at night  they 're just all up on my bed and we 're doing homework all together and
  one of them wants to be a preacher  one of them wants to be a firefighter  and one of the girls says she 's going to be a lawyer 
 they don 't cry like they used to and they don 't fight like they did 
 that 's all i need now is my kids things keep on changing 
 the way i feel the way i act i can go outside not being afraid anymore  
 and i don 't think those bad feelings are coming back
  and if it weren 't for dr miranda and that i would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head 
 if i were still alive at all 
 i asked the lord to send me an angel  and he heard my prayers 
 i was really moved by these experiences
  i decided that i wanted to write about them not only in a book i was working on but also in an article  and i got a commission from the new york times magazine to write about depression among the indigent  and i turned in my story  and my editor called me and said we really can 't publish this 
 and i said why not and she said 
 it just is too far fetched these people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they 're virtually ready to run morgan stanley it 's just too implausible
  of anything like it and i said the fact that you 've never heard of it is an indication that it is news 
 and you are a news magazine 
 so after a certain amount of negotiation they agreed to it  but i think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste
  that people still have for the idea of treatment  the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities  that would be exploitative because we would be changing 
  them there is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us that treatment of depression the medications and so on are an artifice  and that it 's not
  i think that 's very misguided  it would be natural for people 's teeth to fall out but there is nobody militating against toothpaste 
 at least not in my circles
 people then say but isn 't depression part of what people are supposed to experience didn 't we evolve to have depression isn 't it part of your personality to which i would say  mood 
  is adaptive being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all
  of the other moods that we have that 's incredibly valuable and major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken  it 's maladaptive 
  people will come to me and say i think though if i just stick it out for another year  i think i can just get through this 
  life is short  and that 's a whole year you 're talking about giving up think it through 
 it 's a strange poverty of the english language and indeed of many other languages that we use this same word depression to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday  
 and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide  
 people say to me well is it
  a way it 's continuous with normal sadness  there is a certain amount of continuity  but it 's the same way there 's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot
  that you have to sand off and do a little repainting  and what happens if you leave the house for one hundred years and it rusts through until it 's only a pile of orange dust  and it 's that orange dust spot that orange dust
  setting out
 to address so now people say you take these happy pills and do you feel happy and i don 't 
 but i don 't feel sad about having to eat lunch and i don 't feel sad about my answering machine  and i don 't feel sad about taking a shower 
 i feel more in fact  i think  because i can feel sadness without nullity  i feel
  about damaged relationships about global warming 
 those are the things that i feel sad about now  
 and i said to myself well what is the conclusion how did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through 
 what is the mechanism of resilience  
 and what i came up with over time was that the people who
  i was depressed a long time ago i never want to think about it again  i 'm not going to look at it and i 'm just going to get on with my life ironically  those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have 
 shutting out the depression strengthens it  
 while you hide from it it
 grows  and the people who do better are are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have
  have this condition those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience so frank russakoff said to me if i had a do over i suppose i wouldn 't do it this 
  way  but in a strange way i 'm grateful for what i 've experienced i 'm glad to have been in the hospital forty times it taught me so much about love 
 and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me and will be always 
  used to volunteer in an aids clinic and i would just talk and talk and talk 
 and the people i was dealing with weren 't very responsive and i thought ' that 's not very friendly or helpful of them ' 
 and then i realized 
 i realized that they weren 't going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk it was simply going to be an occasion where i didn 't have aids and i wasn 't dying
  could tolerate the fact that they did and they were our needs
 are our greatest assets it turns out i 've learned to give all the things i need 
 valuing one 's depression does not prevent a relapse  but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself
 easier to tolerate
  the question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful  it 's of seeking that meaning and thinking when it comes again this will be hellish  but i will learn something from it 
 i have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be how it can be more real
  real than facts  
 and i have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way  
 the opposite of depression is not happiness  but vitality  
 and these days my life is vital even on the days when i 'm sad  
 i felt that funeral in my brain  and i sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world  
 have discovered something inside of myself that i would have to call a soul
 that i had never formulated until that day twenty years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit  
 i think
 that while i hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again 
  found a way to love my depression  i love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy  
 i love it because each day i decide sometimes gamely  and sometimes against the moment 's reason 
 to cleave to the reasons for living 
 and that i think  is a highly privileged rapture  thank you
