  you 've all seen lots of articles on climate change and here 's yet another new york times article just like every other darn one you 've seen it says all the same stuff as all the other ones you 've seen  it even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you 've seen what 's unusual about this one
  and the reason i 'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent  that people have just sort of figured out about it and now with kyoto and the governator and 
 people beginning to actually do something we may be on the road to a solution the fact is uh uh 
  this is the growth rate of co2 in the atmosphere you 've seen this in various forms  but maybe you haven 't seen this one what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating  and 
 that it 's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back so that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible that emissions would never grow
  as fast as that red line but in fact they 're growing faster 
 here 's some data from actually just ten days ago  which shows this year 's minimum of the arctic sea ice and it 's the lowest by far  and the rate at which the arctic sea ice 
  is going away is a lot quicker than models so despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning
  and politicians signing treaties in fact you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative because it 's just consumed a lot of jet fuel 
 terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing our big economy we 've really hardly started really we 're doing this  basically 
 really not very much
  i don 't want to depress
  you too much the problem is absolutely soluble  and even soluble in a way that 's reasonably cheap cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military not the cost
 of of medical care  cheap meaning a few percent of gdp  
 no this is really important to have this sense of scale  so the problem is soluble and the way we should go about solving solving it is say  dealing with electricity production which causes something like
  percent and rising of co2 emissions and we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation  and wind power nuclear power and coal to co2 capture which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment and work 
 all we lack is the
 action to actually spend the money to put those into place  instead we spend our time talking but nevertheless that 's not what i 'm going to talk to you about tonight what i 'm going to talk to
  about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing  and it 's this stuff in the middle here  which is what you do if you don 't stop the emissions quickly enough and 
  you need to deal somehow break the link between human actions that change climate and the climate change itself  and that 's particularly important because of course while we can adapt to climate change 
 and it 's important to be honest here there will be some benefits to climate change oh yes i think it 's bad i 've spent my whole life working to stop it but one of the reasons it 's politically hard is there are winners and losers not all losers
  losers but of course the natural world polar bears i spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high arctic they will completely lose and there 's no adaption  
 so this problem is absolutely soluble this geo engineering idea in it 's simplest form is basically the following you could put
 signed particles say sulfuric acid particles sulfates into the upper
  the stratosphere where they 'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet 
 and i know for certain that that will work  not that there aren 't side effects but i know for certain it will work  and the reason is it 's been done  
 and it was done not by us not by me but by nature here 's mount pinatubo in the early ' 90s that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere
 with a sort of atomic bomb like cloud  the result of that was pretty dramatic after that and some previous volcanoes we have you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere  so this lower bar is
  the upper atmosphere the stratosphere and it heats up after these volcanoes but you 'll notice that in the upper bar which is the lower atmosphere and the surface it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit 
  there 's no big mystery about it there 's lots of mystery in the details  and there 's some bad side effects like it partially destroys the ozone layer and i 'll get to that in a minute  but it clearly cools down and one other thing 
  much of the other things that we ought to do like slowing emissions are intrinsically slow because it takes takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions and not only that when you cut emissions 
 you don 't cut concentrations because concentrations the amount of co2 in the air is the sum of emissions over time so you can 't step on the brakes very quickly but if you do this  it 's quick  and there are times you might like to do something quick
  does it work can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally and the answer seems to be 
 yes  so here are the graphs you 've seen lots of times before that 's what the world looks like under one particular climate model 's view with twice the amount of co2 in the air  the lower graph is with twice the amount of
  one point eight percent less sunlight and you 're back to the original climate and this graph from ken caldeira  it 's important to say came because ken
 at a meeting that i believe marty hoffart was also at in the mid ' 90s ken and i stood up at the back of the meeting and said geo engineering won 't work and to the person who was promoting it said 
 the atmosphere 's much more complicated gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn 't do a very good compensation ken went and ran his models and found that it did 
 this topic is also old that report that landed on president johnson 's desk when i was two years old
 that report  in fact which had all the modern climate science the only thing they talked about doing was geo engineering it didn 't even talk about cutting emissions which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem 
 i 'm not saying we shouldn 't cut emissions we should but it it made exactly this point so in a sense there 's not much new the one new thing is this essay  
  people always talked about this idea not as something that was foolproof but as an idea to think about but when climate became politically 
 a hot topic if i may make the pun in in the last fifteen years this became so un pc we couldn 't talk about it it just sunk
  the surface we weren 't allowed to speak about it but in the last year paul crutzen published this essay
 saying roughly what 's all been said before that maybe given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts we should think about things like this  he said roughly what 's been said before  the big 
  deal was he happened to have won the nobel prize for ozone chemistry and so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this  even though there will be some ozone impacts and in fact he had some ideas to make them go away there was all sorts of press coverage all over the world 
  earth from the economist  and that got me thinking i 've worked on this topic on and off but not so much technically  and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night and i thought about this child 's toy
 hence the title of my talk and i wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin ' round in the child 's radiometer to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there
  problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly the other problem is they 're right in the ozone layer and i 'd prefer them above the ozone layer 
 and it turns out i woke up the next morning and i started to calculate this it was very hard to calculate from first principles i was stumped 
 but then i found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere 
 so it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere about one hundred kilometers up that already have this effect i
 'll tell you very quickly how the effect works there are a lot of fun complexities that i 'd love to spend the whole evening on
 but let 's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it 's unevenly heated  so the side facing the sun is warmer the side away cooler  gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity 
 because it 's warm  and so you see a net force away from the sun that 's called the photophoretic force 
 we 're in the middle of thinking about it but so far it seems good  but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes much longer than before because they 're levitated 
 we can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere in principle solving the ozone problem
  i 'm sure there will be other problems that arise finally we could make the particles migrate to over the poles
  so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet where we live and do the maximum job of what we might 
  need to do which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency if you like this is a new idea that 's crept up that may be essentially a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in 
  eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in that if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this  
 it 's amazing how we can affect the planet  the one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage this improved science and engineering will  whether we 
  like it or not give us more and more leverage to affect the planet to control the planet to give us weather and climate control not because we plan it not because we
  just because science delivers it to us bit by bit with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it now suppose that
 space aliens arrived maybe they 're going to land at the u n headquarters down the road here or maybe they 'll pick a smarter spot but
 suppose they arrive and they give you a box  and the box has two knobs one knob is the knob for controlling global temperature maybe another knob is a knob for controlling
  might imagine that we would fight wars over that box because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs we have no global governance 
 and different people will have different places they want it set 
 now i don 't think that 's going to happen it 's not very likely  but
 we 're building that box the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece in their labs
  even when they 're doing it for other reasons even when they 're thinking they 're just working on protecting the environment they have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet  
 they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do  
 and so i guess my view on this is not that i want to do it i do not
 but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously because sooner or later we 'll be confronted with decisions about this  and it 's better if we think hard about it even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it
 'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my
 thinking about how to think about it but what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this we need a broader debate a debate that involves
 musicians scientists philosophers  
 writers who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are so here 's one way to think about it
 is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it 's cheaper  i guess the thing i haven 't said about this is it is absurdly cheap  it 's conceivable that say using the sulfates method or this method i 've come up with you could
 create an ice age at a cost of
  percent of gdp  it 's very cheap we have a lot of leverage it 's not a good
  how big the lever is the lever is that big  and that that calculation isn 't much in dispute  you might argue about the
 sanity of it but the leverage is
 real so because of this we could deal with the problem simply by stopping
 reducing emissions and just as as the concentrations
  we can increase the amount of geo engineering i don 't think anybody takes that seriously 
 because under this scenario  we walk further and further away from the current climate we have all sorts of other problems like ocean acidification that come from co2 in the atmosphere anyway
  nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this  but here 's a case which is harder to reject 
 let 's say that we don 't do geo engineering we do what we ought to do which is get serious about cutting emissions  but we don 't really know how quickly we have to cut them there 's a lot of
  uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much 
 so let 's say that we work hard and we actually don 't just tap the brakes but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations  and maybe someday like two 
 october twenty three
 we finally reach that that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side and we have global celebrations and we 've actually started to you
 know we 've seen the worst of it
 but maybe on that day we also find that the greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast 
 fast enough to put meters of sea level
 on the oceans in the next one hundred years  and remove some of the biggest cities from the map that 's an absolutely possible scenario we might decide at that point
 that even though geo engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy that it 's a lot better than not
  very different way to look at the problem  it 's using this as risk control not instead of action  it 's saying that you do some geo engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off not that you 'd use it as a substitute for action 
 but there is a problem with that view and the problem is the following  knowledge that geo engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome and that makes
 a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today this is what economists
  call a moral hazard  
 and that 's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about and in general i think it 's the underlying reason that it 's been politically unacceptable to talk about this  but you don 't
 make good policy by hiding things
 in a drawer i 'll leave you with three questions and then one final quote should we do serious research on this topic
  should we have a national research program that looks at this not just at how you would do it better but also what all the risks and downsides of it are right now you have a few enthusiasts talking about it  some in a positive side 
 some in a negative side but that 's a dangerous state to be in because there 's very little depth of knowledge on this topic 
  i think there is a serious problem as you talk about this  people begin to think they don 't need to work so hard to cut emissions  another thing is maybe we need a treaty
 a treaty that decides who gets to do this  
 right now we may think of a big rich country like the u s doing this  but it might well be that in fact if china wakes up in two thousand and thirty and realizes that the climate impacts are just
  may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this and they may just decide they 'd really rather have a geo engineered world than a non geo engineered world 
 and we 'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision
