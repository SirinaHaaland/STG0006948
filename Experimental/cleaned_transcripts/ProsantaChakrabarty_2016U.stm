  the study of fishes it looks like a big  boring word 
 but it 's actually quite exciting because ichthyology is the only ology with yolo
  to the cool kids in the audience you already know yolo stands for you only live once 
 and because i only have one life i 'm going to spend it doing what i always dreamt of doing seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species  and that 's what i get to do  
 now in recent years i really focused on caves for finding new species  and it turns out there 's lots of new cavefish species out there 
 you just have to know where to look 
 and to maybe be a little thin
  now cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology 
 they can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved by being stuck in these little holes  
 and they can tell me about the evolution of sight  by being blind 
 now fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours all vertebrates
  and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark cold cave environment 
 over many many generations they lose their eyes and their eyesight until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here  
 now  each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way  
 and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us  and that 's why it 's so exciting when we find a new species 
 so this is a new
  its closest relatives are cavefishes in kentucky in the mammoth cave system and they start to diverge when the ohio river split them a few million years ago  
 and in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness  
 there 's this gene called rhodopsin that 's super critical for sight we have it and these species have it too
  species has lost all function in that gene and the other one maintains it 
 so this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision and at the very roots of how we can see  
 but the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time maybe no
  more so than in this species here this is a new species we described from madagascar that we named
 that means big sickness in malagasy for how sick we got trying to collect this species  
 now  believe it or not  swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop isn 't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life
 despite the fact that it tried to kill us  
 and that 's because this species in madagascar its closest relatives are six thousand kilometers away cavefishes in australia 
 now there 's no way a three inch long freshwater cavefish can swim across the indian ocean 
 so what we found when we compared the dna of these species is that they 've been separated for more than one hundred million years  or about the time that the southern continents
  southern continents were last together 
 so in fact these species didn 't move at all it 's the continents that moved them 
 and so they give us through their dna this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events 
 now this species here is so new i 'm not even allowed to tell you its name
  can tell you it 's a new species from mexico  and it 's probably already extinct 
 it 's probably extinct because the only known cave system it 's from was destroyed when a dam was built nearby  
 unfortunately for cavefishes their groundwater habitat is also our main source of drinking water  
 now  we actually don 't know this species ' closest relative yet it doesn 't appear to be anything else in mexico
  so maybe it 's something in cuba  or florida  or india  
 but whatever it is it might tell us something new about the geology of the caribbean or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blindness  
 but i hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too  
 and i 'm going to spend my one life as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cavefishes
 that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet
 and the biology of how we see  thank you
