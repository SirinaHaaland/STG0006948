  my story is a little bit about war  it 's about disillusionment  it 's about
 death  and it 's about rediscovering idealism
 in all of that
  there 's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed up fragmenting and
 dangerous world of the 21st century  
 i don 't believe in straightforward narratives  i don 't believe in a life or history written as decision a led to consequence b led to consequence c 
  these neat narratives that we 're presented with and that perhaps we encourage in each other i believe in randomness and
  reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random  i 'm colorblind i was born unable to see most colors this is why i wear
 gray and black most of the time  and i have to take my wife with me to to chose clothes  and
 i 'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when i was a boy i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside
 boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot and i did the tests in the royal air force
 to become a pilot and sure enough i failed i couldn 't see all the blinking different lights and i can 't distinguish color 
 so i had to choose another career  and this was in fact relatively easy for me because i had
 an abiding passion all the way through my childhood which was international relations
  as a child i read the newspaper thoroughly  i was fascinated by the cold war by the inf negotiations over
  nuclear missiles  the proxy war between the soviet union and the u s in
 angola or afghanistan  these things really interested me and so i decided quite at an early age i wanted to be a diplomat
 one day 
 i announced this to my parents and my father denies this story to this day i said daddy i want to be a diplomat and he turned to me and he said carne you have to be very clever to be a diplomat and
 my ambition was sealed 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine i entered the british foreign service  that year five thousand people applied to become a diplomat  and twenty
  as those numbers suggest i was inducted into an elite
 and fascinating and exhilarating world
 being a diplomat  then and now is an incredible job  and i loved every minute of it i enjoyed the status of it i bought myself a nice suit and wore  leather soled shoes
 and reveled in this this amazing
  access i had to world events i
 traveled to the gaza strip i headed the middle east peace process section in the british foreign ministry i became a speechwriter
 for the british foreign secretary i met yasser arafat  i negotiated with
 saddam 's diplomats at the u n later i traveled to kabul and served in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban  and i would travel
  and go and visit warlords in
 mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to
 eradicate al qaeda from afghanistan surrounded by my special forces escort who themselves had to have an escort of a platoon of royal marines because it was so dangerous
  and that was exciting that was fun  it was really interesting
  community of people and the pinnacle of my career as it turned out was when i was posted to new york
 i 'd already served in germany  norway various other places
 but i was posted to new york to serve on the u n security council for the british delegation and my responsibility was
 the middle east which was my specialty  and there i dealt with things like the middle east peace process
  issue we can talk about that later if you wish
 but above all my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons 
 i was the the chief british negotiator on the subject  and i was steeped in the
 it was kind of a very exciting time i mean it was very very dramatic diplomacy  we went through several wars during my time
 in new york  i negotiated for my country
 the resolution in the security council of the 12th of september two thousand and one condemning the attacks of the day before which were of course deeply present to us
 actually living in new york at the time so
  it was kind of the best of time worst of times kind of experience  i lived the
 high life although i worked very long hours i lived in a penthouse in union square i was a single british diplomat in new york city you can imagine what that might have meant 
 i had a good time but
 in two thousand and two when my tour came to an end
  i wasn 't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london i decided to take a sabbatical in fact at the new school bruce
 in some inchoate inarticulate way i realized that there was something wrong with my work with me
  i was exhausted  and i was also disillusioned in a way i couldn 't quite put my finger on and i decided to take some time out from work
  the foreign office was very generous you could take these special unpaid leave as they called them and yet remain part of the diplomatic service but not actually do any work it was nice
  and eventually i decided to take a secondment to join the u n in kosovo
  which was
 then under u n administration and two things happened in kosovo which kind of  again shows the randomness of life because
  these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next
 stage  
 but they were random things one was that in the summer of two thousand and four the british government  somewhat reluctantly decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on wmd in the run up to the iraq war
  very limited subject  and
 i testified to that inquiry in secret 
 i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd and my testimony to the inquiry said three things that
 the government exaggerated the intelligence which was very clear in all the years i 'd read it  and indeed our own internal assessment was very clear
 that iraq 's wmd did not pose a threat to its neighbors let alone to us secondly the government had ignored all
  available alternatives to war  which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still
  the third reason i won 't go into but anyway i gave that testimony  and that presented me with a crisis what was i going to do 
 this testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues of my ministers 
 who had in my view had perpetrated a war on a
  and so i was in crisis  and this wasn 't a pretty thing i moaned about it i hesitated  i went on and on and on to my long suffering wife 
 and eventually i decided to resign from the british foreign service i felt
 there 's a scene in the al pacino movie the insider which you may know where he goes back to cbs after they 've let him down over the
 the tobacco guy  and he goes you know i just can 't do this anymore something 's broken and it was like that for me i love that movie  i felt
  just something 's broken i can 't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what i used to do gladly for them  so took a running leap
 and jumped over the edge of a cliff  and
 it was a very very uncomfortable  unpleasant feeling  and i started to fall and
 today that fall hasn 't stopped  i 'm still falling
  but in a way i 've got used to the sensation of it  and in a way i kind of like the sensation of it
 a lot better than i like actually standing on top of the cliff wondering what to do a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of i need a quick
 gulp of water forgive me 
 a second thing happened in kosovo which
 and what was i going to do  and
 that year in kosovo this terrible terrible thing happened  which i saw  
 in march two thousand and four there were terrible riots all over the province as it then was of kosovo  
 eighteen people were killed it was anarchy
  and it 's a very horrible thing to see anarchy to know that the police and the military there were lots of military troops there actually can 't stop that rampaging mob who
  coming down the street and the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street
 will stop is when they decide to stop and when they 've had enough burning and killing  and that is not a very nice feeling to see and i saw it  and i went through it i went through those mobs 
 and with my albanian friends we tried to stop it but we failed  and that riot taught me something
  which isn 't immediately obvious and it 's kind of a complicated story but one of the reasons that riot took place those riots which went on for several days took place was because
 the kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future 
 there were diplomatic negotiations about the future of kosovo going on then 
 and the kosovo government let alone the kosovo people were not actually participating in those talks 
 there was this whole fancy diplomatic system this negotiation process about the
  of kosovo and the kosovars weren 't part of it  and funnily enough they were frustrated about that
 those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration it wasn 't the only reason and life is not simple one reason narratives it was a complicated thing and i 'm not pretending it was more more simple than it was but that was one of the reasons 
 and that kind of gave me the inspiration or rather to be precise it gave my wife
  why don 't you advise the kosovars why don 't you advise their government on their diplomacy 
 and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service they were not allowed diplomats 
 they were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process which became known as the final status process of kosovo  
 and so that was the idea that was the origin of the thing that became independent diplomat the world 's first diplomatic advisory group and
 a non profit to boot  
 and it began when i flew back from london from london after my time at the u n in kosovo i flew back and had dinner with the kosovo prime minister and said to him look 
 i 'm proposing that i come and advise you on the diplomacy i know this stuff it 's what i do why don 't i come and help you and he raised his glass of raki to me and said yes carne come and
  i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government independent diplomat ended up advising three successive kosovo prime ministers
 and the multi party negotiation team of of kosovo and kosovo became independent independent diplomat is now
 established in five diplomatic centers around the world  and we 're advising seven or eight different countries or
 political groups  depending on how you wish to define them and i 'm not big on definitions we 're advising the northern cypriots on how to reunify their
  island we 're advising the burmese opposition  the government of southern sudan which
 you heard it here first is going to be a new country within the next few years
  we 're advising the polisario front of the western sahara who are fighting to get their country back
 from moroccan occupation after thirty four years of dispossession  we 're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations which is suppose to culminate
 in copenhagen
  there 's a bit of randomness here too because when i was beginning independent diplomat i went to a party in the house of lords which is a ridiculous place but
 i was holding my drink like this and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me and we started talking  and he said
 i told him what i was doing  and
 i told him rather grandly i was going to establish independent diplomat in new york at that time there was just me and
  me and my wife were moving back to new york  and he said why don 't you see my colleagues in new york and it turned out he
 worked for an innovation company called  what if which some of you have probably heard of 
 and one thing led to another  and i ended up having a desk in what if 
 in new york  when i started independent diplomat  and
  what if develop new flavors of chewing gum for wrigley or new flavors for coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the kosovars and for the saharawis of 
  the western sahara  and i began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy that diplomacy like business is a business of solving problems 
  things and independent diplomat today tries to
 incorporate some of the things i learned at what if we all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office we all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think and
 we use
 naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we 're dealing with but may know something about something else to try to inject
  new thinking into the problems that we try to
 address for our clients it 's not easy because our clients by definition are having a difficult time  diplomatically
 there are i don 't know some lessons from all of this  personal and political and in a way they 're the same thing
  the personal one is
 falling off a cliff is actually a good thing  and i recommend it
  and it 's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump
  the second thing is is a bigger lesson about the world today  independent diplomat is part of a trend
 which is emerging and evident across the world  which is that the world is fragmenting states mean less than they
  the power of the state is declining
  that means the power of others things is rising those other things are called non state actors they may be corporations they may be mafiosi they may be nice ngos they may
 anything any number of things
  we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world if governments are less able to affect the problems
 that
 affect us in
  then that means who is left to deal with them who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them us
  if they can 't do it  who 's left to deal with it we have no choice but to embrace that reality
 what this means is it 's no longer good enough to say that international relations or global affairs or chaos in somalia  
 or what 's going on in burma is none of your business  and that you can leave it to governments to get on with
 i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the  al shabaab militia in somalia 
 ask me how later particularly if you eat fish interestingly enough
  but that connection is there we are all intimately connected and this isn 't just tom friedman it 's actually provable in case after case after case 
 what that means is instead of asking your politicians to do things you have to look to yourself to
  do things  and independent diplomat is a kind of example of this
 in a sort of loose way there aren 't neat examples but one example is this 
 the way the world is changing is embodied in what 's going on at the place i used to work the u n security council the u n was established in 
 its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states interstate conflict today  eighty percent of the
  agenda of the u n security council is about conflicts within states 
 involving non state parties guerillas  separatists terrorists if you want to call them that 
 people who are not normal governments who are not normal states that is the state of the world today  when
 i realized this and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars and i realize that
 often the
  people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council weren 't actually there weren 't actually invited to give their views to the security council i thought this is wrong something 's got to be done about this 
 so i started off in a traditional mode 
 me and my colleagues at independent diplomat went around the u n security council  we went around seventy u n member states the kazaks the ethiopians the israelis you name them we went to see them
  the secretary general all of them and said this is all wrong this is terrible that you don 't consult these people who are actually affected you 've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the 
  kosovars to come and tell you what they think this will allow you to tell me you can tell them what you think it 'll be great you can have an exchange you can actually
  incredibly logical so obvious anybody could get it and of course everybody got it everybody went yes of course you 're absolutely right  come back to us in
 maybe six months and of course nothing happened nobody did anything 
 the security council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did
 x number of years ago when i was there ten years ago  so we looked at that observation
  of basically failure
 and thought what can we do about it and i thought  i 'm buggered if i 'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done 
 so what we 're going to do is we 're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves 
 so now independent diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings
  the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the security council so we will be bringing
 darfuri rebel groups  the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots
  rebels from
 aceh and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world  and we will be trying to bring the parties
 to new york to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting
 with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the u n security council and for the members of the u n security council to explain to them what they want  so there 's actually a conversation which has never before happened 
 and
 of course  describing all this any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult and i entirely agree with you the chances of failure are very high 
  it certainly won 't happen if we don 't try to make it happen 
 and my politics has changed fundamentally from when i was a diplomat to what i am today  and i think that outputs is what matters not process not technology frankly so much either 
 preach technology to all the twittering members of all the iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in tehran where ahmadinejad remains in power
 technology has not delivered political change in iran  
 you 've got to look at the outputs  and you got to say to yourself what can i do to produce that particular output that is the politics of the 21st century  
 and in a way independent diplomat embodies
 that fragmentation that change that is happening to all of us
