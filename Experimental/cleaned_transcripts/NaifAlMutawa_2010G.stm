  thousand and ten the justice league of america will be teaming up with the ninety nine 
 icons like batman superman wonder woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons
  and their colleagues it 's a story of intercultural intersections  and what better group to have this conversation
 than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies 
 as fascism took over europe in the 1930s an unlikely reaction came out of north america as christian iconography
 got changed and swastikas were created out of crucifixes batman and
  superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada also going back to the bible 
 consider this like the prophets all the superheroes are missing parents superman 's parents die on krypton
 before the age of one  
 bruce wayne who becomes batman loses his parents at the age of six in gotham city spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle 
 and all of them just like
  the prophets who get their message from god through gabriel get their message from above peter parker is in a library in manhattan when the spider descends from above
 and gives him his message through a bite  bruce wayne is in his bedroom
 when a big bat flies over his head  and he sees it as an omen to become batman 
 superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens
  krypton but he 's sent in a pod much like moses was on the nile 
 and you hear the voice of his father jor el saying to earth i have sent to you my only son 
 these are clearly biblical archetypes and the thinking behind that was to create positive
  the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of
 because then the person that 's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message 
 and it 's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked 
 this is the kind of thinking that went into creating the ninety nine 
 the ninety nine references the ninety nine attributes of allah in the koran things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would
  disagree about it doesn 't matter what your religion is even if you 're an atheist you don 't raise your kid telling him you know make sure you lie three times a day 
 those are basic human values 
 and so the backstory of the ninety nine takes place in one thousand two hundred and fifty eight which history tells us the mongols invaded baghdad and destroyed it all the books from bait al hikma library the most famous library in its day 
 were thrown in the tigris river and the tigris changes color with ink it 's a story passed on generation after generation 
 and in my version the librarians find out that this is going to happen and here 's a side note if you want a comic book to do well make the librarians the hero it always works well 
 so the librarians find out and they get together a special solution a chemical solution called king 's water that when mixed with ninety nine stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books  but the mongols get there first the books and the solution get
  thrown in the tigris river  some librarians escape and over the course of days and weeks they dip the stones into the tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization 
 those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of thirty three stones each through arabia into andalusia in spain where they 're safe for two hundred years but in 
 two important things happen the first is the fall of granada the last muslim enclave in europe  the second is columbus finally gets funded to go to india
  but he gets lost 
 so thirty three of the stones are smuggled onto the nina the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world
 thirty three go on the silk road to china south asia and southeast asia and thirty three are spread between europe the middle east and africa and now it 's two thousand and ten and there are ninety nine
 heroes from ninety nine different countries 
 now it 's very easy to assume that those books because they were from a library called
  muslim books  but that 's not the case because the caliph that built that library his name was al ma 'mun he was harun  al rashid 's son  he had told his advisers get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into arabic and i will pay them its weight in gold 
 after a while his advisers complained they said your highness 
 the scholars are cheating they 're writing in big handwriting to take more gold 
 to which he said let them be because what they 're giving us is worth a lot more than what we 're paying them
  so the idea of an open architecture an open knowledge is not new to my neck of the desert
 the concept centers on something called the noor stones noor is arabic for light so these ninety nine stones a few kind of rules in the game number one you don 't choose the stone the stone chooses you there 's a king arthur element to the storyline  
 okay  number two all of the ninety nine when they first get their stone or their power abuse it they use it for self interest and there 's a very strong
  message in there that when you start abusing your stone you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers  
 okay  number three the  ninety nine stones all have within them a mechanism that self updates now there are two groups that exist within the muslim world 
 everybody believes the koran is for all time and all place  some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what 's relevant today  i don 't belong there 
 then there 's a group that believes the koran is
  living breathing document
 and i captured that idea within these stones that self update now the main bad guy  rughal  does not want these stones to update so he 's trying to get them to stop updating he can 't use the stones 
 but he can stop them and by stopping them he has more of a fascist agenda where he gets some of the ninety nine to work for him they 're all wearing cookie cutter same color uniforms they 're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are and he controls them from the top down whereas
  when they work for the other side eventually when they find out this is the the wrong person they 've been manipulated  they actually each one has a different colorful kind of
 dress and the last point about the ninety nine noor stones is this so the ninety nine work in teams of three 
 why three a couple of reasons number one we have a thing within islam that you don 't leave a boy and a girl alone together because the third person is temptation or the devil
  but this is not about religion it 's not about proselytizing there 's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the
 deepest crevices of intolerance and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game and so this is the way i dealt with it they work in teams of three two boys and a girl two girls and a boy three boys three girls no problem and the swiss psychoanalyst carl jung also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures so i figure i
  i got accused in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the pope to preach the trinity and catholicism in the middle east so you 
 you believe who you want i gave you my version of the story
  so here 's some of the characters that we have mujiba from malaysia her main power is she 's able to answer any question she 's the trivial pursuit queen if you want  
 but when she first gets her power she starts going on game shows and making money  
 we have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power
  mumita was a fun one to name mumita is the destroyer so  the
 ninety nine attributes of allah have the yin and the yang there 's the powerful the hegemonous the strong and there 's also the kind the generous i 'm like are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong i 'm like you know what i 've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime so 
 we have jami from hungary who first starts making weapons he 's the technology wiz
  musawwira from ghana
 hadya from pakistan jaleel from iran who uses fire and this is one of my favorites al batina from yemen
  al batina is the hidden so al batina is hidden but she 's a superhero  i came home to my wife and i said i created a character after you my wife is a saudi from yemeni roots and she said 
 show me so i showed this she said that 's not me i said 
 look at the eyes they 're your eyes 
 so i promised my investors this
  this was going to be superman or it wasn 't worth my time or their money 
 so from day one the people involved in the project bottom left is fabian nicieza writer for x men and power rangers next to him is dan panosian one of the character creators for the modern day x men top right 
  is stuart moore a writer for iron man next to him is john mccrea who was an inker for spiderman and we entered western consciousness with a tagline next ramadan the world will
  back in two thousand and five 
 now i went to dubai to an arab thought foundation conference  and i was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist didn 't have a product but had energy  
 and i found somebody from the new york times
 and i cornered him and i pitched him and i think i scared him 
 because he basically promised me we had no product but he said    we 'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you 'll just go away 
  so a few days after that what happens what happens is the world erupts in the danish cartoon controversy  i became timely
 so flurry of phone calls and emails from the new york times next thing you knew there 's a full page covering us positively january 22nd two thousand and six which changed our lives forever because anybody googling islam 
  and cartoon or islam and comic guess what they got they got me 
 and the  ninety nine were like superheroes kind of flying out of what
 was happening around the world and that led to all kinds of things from being in curricula in universities and schools to one of my favorite
 pictures i have from south asia it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab it looked like a school the good news is they 're all holding copies of the ninety nine smiling and they found me to sign the picture the bad news is they were all photocopies so we didn 't make a dime in revenue 
  comic books into eight languages so far chinese indonesian hindi urdu turkish 
 opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the ninety nine village theme park three hundred thousand square feet twenty rides all with our characters a couple back to school licenses in spain and turkey  
 but the biggest thing we 've done to date which is  just amazing is that we 've done
 a 26 episode animated series which is done for global audiences in fact we 're already going to be in the u s and turkey we know 
  written in hollywood by the writers behind ben ten and spiderman and star wars clone wars 
 in this clip i 'm about to show you which has never been seen in the public before 
 there is a struggle two of the characters jabbar the one with the muscles and noora the one that can use light are actually wearing the cookie cutter fascist gray uniform because they 're being manipulated  they don 't know
  ok and they 're trying to get another
  i can 't see where to grab hold i need more light  
 what 's happening dana there 's too much darkness rughal 
 there must be something we can do man i won 't send any more commandos in until i know it 's safe
  it 's time to go miklos miklos must download file contents i can 't forget auntie jabbar dana 
 i can 't do this without you dana but i can 't help jabbar 
 you can even if you don 't believe in yourself right now i believe in
  tell me which way to go
  don 't listen to them dana miklos that man is not your friend miklos no he gave me access  and you want to reboot the
  is technology it 's entertainment it 's design  but that 's only half the story  
 as the father of five sons  
 i worry about who they 're going to be using as role models  i worry because all around me even within my extended family i see religion being manipulated 
 as a psychologist i worry
 for the world in general but
 worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world 
 now i 'm a clinical psychologist i 'm licensed in new york state i trained at bellevue hospital survivors of political torture program  
 and i heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership only to end up being tortured by their heroes and torture 's a terrible enough thing as it is but when it 's done by your hero that just breaks you in so many ways
  i left bellevue went to business school and started this now
 one of the things that i refer to when i when i about the importance of this message is that i gave a lecture at the medical school at kuwait university where i lecture on the biological basis of behavior  
 and i gave the students two articles one from the new york times and one from new york magazine  and i took away the name of the writer the name of the [ unclear ] everything was gone except the facts and the first one was about a group called the party of god who
 wanted to ban valentine 's day red was made illegal any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately
 the second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn 't related to her  
 and i asked the students in kuwait where they thought these incidents took place 
 the first one  they said saudi arabia there was no debate  
 the second one they were actually split between saudi and afghanistan 
 what blew their mind was the first one took place in india it was the party of a hindu god
  one took place in upstate new york  it was an orthodox jewish community  but what breaks my heart and what 's alarming
 is that in those two interviews  the people around who were interviewed as well  refer to that behavior as talibanization 
 in other words good hindus and good jews don 't act this way this is islam 's influence on hinduism and judaism  but what do the students in kuwait say  they said it 's us
 and this is dangerous
 's dangerous when a group self identifies itself as extreme 
 this is one of my sons rayan who 's a scooby doo addict you can tell by the glasses there he actually called me a meddling kid the other day 
 but i borrow a lesson that i learned from from him last summer when we were in our home in new york he was
  he left his scooby doo in his house i said go away  i 'm working i 'm busy and what rayan did then
 is he sat there he tapped his foot on the floor at three and a half and he looked at me and he said baba  
 i want you to come with me to my office in my house  i have work to do applause
  rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level 
 and with the ninety nine that is what we aim to do  you know i think that there 's a big parallel between
 bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas and when i see pictures like this of parents or uncles who think it 's cute to have a little child holding
 a koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something the hope is by linking enough positive things
 to the koran that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they 're proud there 
 to that
  and i think i think the ninety nine can and will achieve its mission
 as an undergrad at tufts
  were giving away free falafel one day and  you know it was middle east day or something and people came up and picked up the culturally
 resonant image of the falafel  ate it and you know talked and left and no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was behind us free falafel you know 
 or so we thought until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor pointed up to the sign and said who 's falafel
  she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting 
 just today d c comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover on that cover you see batman superman and a fully clothed wonder woman
 with our saudi member of the ninety nine our emirati member and our libyan member 
  two thousand and ten  president barack obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous cairo speech in which he reached out to the muslim world the most innovative was that the ninety nine reach back out
 to the justice league of america 
 we live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols like the falafel can be misunderstood because of baggage 
 and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it 's not supposed to be by others in a
