  one of my favorite cartoon characters is snoopy  
 i love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life  
 so when i thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he 's lying there
 and he says 
 i really understand  and i really appreciate how one should love one 's neighbor as one love 's oneself  
 the only trouble is the people next door i can 't stand them this in a way is
  of the challenges
 of how to interpret a really good idea we all i think believe in compassion if
 you look at all the world religions all the main world religions you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion  so in judaism we have from our torah that you should love your
 neighbor as you love yourself and within jewish teachings the rabbinic teachings
  have hillel who taught that you shouldn 't do to others what you don 't like being done to yourself 
 and all the main religions have similar teachings  
 and again within judaism  we have a teaching about god  who is called the compassionate one ha rachaman 
 after all how could the world exist without god being compassionate 
 and we as
  taught within the torah that we are made in the image of god  so we too have to be compassionate  
 but what does it mean how does it impact on our everyday life sometimes of course being compassionate
 can produce feelings within us that are
  i know there are many times
 when i 've gone and conducted a funeral  or when i have been sitting with the bereaved  or with people who are dying  
 and i am
 overwhelmed by the
 sadness by the
 difficulty the challenge that is there for the family for the person  and i 'm touched  so that
  tears come to my eyes 
 and yet  if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings i wouldn 't be doing my job
 because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to
  and yet on the other hand if i didn 't feel this compassion then i feel
 that it would be time for me to hang up my robe
 and give up being a rabbi and these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world who 
 be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war
  famine  or earthquakes  or tsunamis  
 i know some people who say well  you know there 's just so much out there i can 't do anything i 'm not going to even begin to try 
 and there are some
 charity workers who call this compassion
  there are others who feel they can 't confront compassion
 anymore  and so they turn off the television and don 't watch 
 in judaism though we tend to always say  there has to be a middle way 
 you have to of course be aware of the needs of
  but you have to be aware in such a way
 that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people so part of compassion has to be
 an understanding
 of what makes people tick and of course you can 't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more and there 's a lovely rabbinic
 interpretation of the beginnings of creation  which says that when
  god created the world  god thought that it would be best to create the world
 only with the divine attribute of justice  
 because after all god is just therefore there should be justice throughout the world  
 and then god looked to the future and realized if the world was created just with justice
  world couldn 't exist so god thought nope i 'm going to create the world
 just with compassion and then god looked to the future
 and realized
 that in fact if the world were just filled with compassion there would be anarchy and chaos there had to be limits
 to all things  the rabbis
 describe
  this as
 being like a king who has a beautiful fragile glass bowl 
 if you put too much cold water in it will
 shatter if you put boiling water in it will shatter  what do you have to do put in a mixture of the two  
 and so god put both of these possibilities
 into the world
 there is something more though that has to be there and that is
 the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion
 into the wider world into action so like
  just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors we actually have to do something about it  
 and so there is also within judaism this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important chesed 
 all these three things then have to be melded together  the idea of justice
  which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a
 feeling of of what 's right about life what 's right about living  what should we be doing  social justice 
 there has to be a willingness to do good deeds  
 but not of course at the expense
 of our own sanity  you know there 's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things and balancing
  them all in the middle
 is this notion of compassion  which has to be there if you like at our very roots 
 this idea of compassion
 comes
 to us because we 're made in the image of god  who is ultimately the compassionate one 
 what does this compassion entail
 it entails understanding the pain of the other but even more than that it means
 understanding one 's connection
 to the whole of creation
 understanding that one is part of that creation  that there is a unity that underlies all that we see 
 all that we hear
  that we feel i call that unity god  and that that unity is something
 that connects all of creation and of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we 're becoming even more aware
 of the connectivity of things  that something i do here
  that if i use too much of my carbon allowance it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain
 in central and eastern africa  
 so there is a connectivity  and i have to understand that
 as part of the creation  as part of me being made in the image of god  and i have to understand
  understand
 that
 my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs this eighteen minutes business  i find quite fascinating 
 because in judaism 
 the number eighteen in hebrew letters  stands for life the word
 in life  this is what 's important in terms of compassion but something else as well 
 actually eighteen minutes is important because at passover when we have to eat unleavened bread the
 rabbis say what is the difference between dough that is made into bread and dough that is made into unleavened bread
  that 's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven  
 what does it mean dough becomes leaven it means it gets filled with hot air 
 what 's matzah what 's unleavened bread  you don 't get it  
 symbolically  what the rabbis say
 is that at passover  what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air
 our pride
  pride our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world and that everything should revolve round us 
 so we try and get rid of those
 and so doing try to get rid of the habits the emotions the ideas that enslave
  that make our eyes
 closed  give us tunnel vision so we don 't see the needs of others and free ourselves and free ourselves from that and
 that too is a basis
 for having compassion for understanding our place in the world  
 now there is 
  gorgeous story
 of a rich man
 who sat in synagogue one day 
 and as many people do he was dozing off during the sermon 
 and as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of leviticus
 in the torah  and they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in jerusalem the priests used to have bread
  used to place into a special table in the temple in jerusalem  
 the man was asleep  but he heard the words bread  temple god  and he woke up he said god
 wants bread that 's it god wants bread i know what god wants and he rushed
  after the sabbath he made
 twelve loaves of bread  
 took them to the synagogue went into the synagogue  
 opened the ark and said god i don 't know why you want this bread but here you are and he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the torah 
 then he went home  
 the cleaner came into the synagogue
  goes to the ark he opens the ark there 's bread  god you 've answered my plea you 've answered my question 
 takes the bread and goes home  
 meanwhile the rich man thinks to himself
  who rules the entire universe wants my bread he rushes to the synagogue i 'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it he goes in there and it 's not there 
 and he says god you really did want it you wanted my bread  next week with raisins 
 this went on for years  
  the man would bring bread with raisins with all sorts of good things put it into the ark  
 every week the cleaner would come god you 've answered my plea again take the bread  take it home  went on until a new rabbi came rabbis always spoil things the
 rabbi came in
 and saw what was going on and he called the two of them to his office  and he said you know this is what 's happening 
  you mean god didn 't want my bread and the poor man said and you mean
 god didn 't answer my pleas and the rabbi said you 've misunderstood me you 've
 misunderstood totally he said of course
  what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering god 's plea that we should be compassionate 
 and god he said to the poor man is answering your plea
 that people should be compassionate and give he looked at the rich man he held the rich man 's hands
 and said don 't you understand he
  so that
 is the way
 i feel that i can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate 
 of understanding
 that there is a connectivity that there is a unity in this world that i want to try and serve
 that unity  
 and that i can try and do that by understanding i hope  trying to understand something of the pain of others  
 but understanding that there are limits that people have to bear responsibility
 for some of the problems that come upon them and that i have to understand that there are limits to my energy to the giving i can give
 i have to reevaluate them try and separate out
 the the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me  so that i can see the world clearly
