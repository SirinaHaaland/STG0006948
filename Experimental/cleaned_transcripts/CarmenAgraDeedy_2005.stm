  i knew i was going to come and speak to you i thought
 i got to call my mother i have a little cuban mother she 's about that big four feet nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts you still with me
 i called her up hello how 're you doing baby
 hey ma i got to talk to you you 're talking to me already what 's the matter i said i 've got to talk to a bunch of nice people you
 're always talking to nice people except when you went to the white house ma don 't start
 and i told her i was coming to ted and she
  i said well i 'm not sure i said
 i have to talk to them about stories
 it 's technology entertainment and design and she said well
 you design a story when you make it up it 's entertainment when you tell it and you 're going to use a microphone
 i said you 're a peach ma pop there what 's the matter the pearls of
  wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you
 then my pop got on there my pop he 's one of the old souls you know old cuban man from camaguey
 camaguey is a province in cuba he 's from florida he was born there in one thousand nine hundred and twenty four he grew up in a
  of dirt floors and the structure was the kind used by the tainos our old arawak ancestors
 my father is at once quick witted wickedly funny
 and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you
 breathless papi help i already heard your mother i think she 's right
 after what i just told you my whole life my father 's been there so we talked for a few minutes and he said why don 't you tell them what you believe
 i love that
 but we don 't have the time
 good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to great story is the art of letting go
 so
  remember this tradition comes to us not from the mists of avalon back in time but further still
 before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus or we were doing the pictographs on walls in in moist damp caves
 back then we had an urge a need to tell the story when lexus wants to sell you a car they 're telling you a story have you been watching the commercials
  because every one of us has this desire for once just once to tell our story and have it heard
 there are stories you tell from stages
 there 's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine and there 's stories you tell
 late at night to a friend
 maybe
  once in your life
 and then there are stories that we whisper into a stygian darkness
 i 'm not telling you that story i 'm telling you this one it 's called you 're going to miss me
 it 's about human connection
 my cuban mother which i just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch
 came to the united states
 one thousand years ago i was born in nineteen i forget
 and i came to this country with them in the aftermath of the cuban revolution we went from havana cuba to decatur georgia
 and decatur georgia 's a small southern town and in that little southern town i grew up
  and grew up hearing these stories but this story only happened a few years ago
 i called my mom it was a saturday morning
 and i was calling about how to make ajiaco it 's a cuban meal it 's it 's delicious it 's savory it makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth it makes your armpits juicy you know
 that kind of food yeah this is the sensory part of the program people
 i called my mother and she said carmen
 i need you to come please i need to go to the mall and you know your father now he takes a nap in the afternoon and i got to go i got an errand to run let me parenthetically pause here and tell you esther my mother had stopped driving several years ago to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta
 any vehicular outing with that woman from the time i was a young child guys naturally included flashing
 blue lights but she 'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue and when she did
  you don 't speak english no
 but eventually every dog has its day and she ended up in traffic court where she bargained with the judge for a discount there
  a historical marker
 but now she was a septuagenarian she 'd stopped driving and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed you know that that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit you
 know same color as the buick
 anybody
 all right little picks on the legs where she does her needlepoint and leaves little loops rockports they 're for this that 's why they call them that
 this is her ensemble
  this is the woman that wants me to come on a saturday morning when i have a lot to do but it doesn 't take long because cuban guilt is a weighty thing not going to get political on you but
 and so i go to my mother 's i show up she 's in the carport of course they have a carport the kind with the corrugated roof you know
 the buick 's parked outside and she 's jingling jangling a pair of keys i got a surprise for you baby are we taking your car not we
  and she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe
 somebody 's storytelling interactive art you can talk to me
 oh a driver 's license a perfectly valid driver 's license issued evidently by the dmv in her own county of gwinnett blithering fucking idiots i said is that thing real
 i think so can you even see i guess i must oh jesus she gets into the car she 's sitting on two phone books i can 't even make
  this part up because she 's that tiny she 's engineered an umbrella so she can bam slam the door her daughter me the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead is still standing there slack jawed
 you coming you no coming oh my god i said ok fine does pop know you 're driving are you kidding me how are you doing
 it he 's got to sleep sometime and so we left my father fast asleep because i knew he 'd kill me if i let her go by herself and we get in the car
  puts it in reverse
 fifty five out of the driveway in reverse i am buckling in seatbelts from the front i 'm yanking them in from the back i 'm doing double knots
 i mean i 've got a mouth as dry as the kalahari desert i 've got a white knuckle grip on the door you know what i 'm talking about
 and she 's whistling and finally
 i do the kind of birth breathing you know that one only a couple of women are going uh
  said ma would you slow down because now she 's picked up the highway two hundred and eighty five the perimeter around atlanta which
 encompasses now there 's seven lanes she 's on all of them y 'all
 i said ma pick a lane they give you seven lanes they expect you to use them and there she goes right
 i don 't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped so i think hey we can talk it 'll be a diversion it 'll help my breathing it 'll do something for my pulse maybe mommy i know you have been stopped no no what you talking
  about you have a license how long have you been driving four or five days yeah and you haven 't been stopped i did not get a ticket
 i said yeah yeah yeah yeah but come on come on come on
 ok so i stopped at a light and there 's a guy you know in the back would this guy have like a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face you weren 't there don 't start
  come on you got a ticket no she explained
 the man i have to tell you as she did because it loses something if i don 't you know he come to the window and he does a thing like this which tells me
  come on come on
  a driver 's license a perfectly
  and she 's whistling
  you 're going to miss me
