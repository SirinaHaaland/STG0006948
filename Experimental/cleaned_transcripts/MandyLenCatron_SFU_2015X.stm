  today i want to talk about how we talk about love and specifically i want to talk about what 's wrong with how we talk about love
 most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives  and in the english language this metaphor
  metaphor falling is really the main way that we talk about that experience i
 don 't know about you but when i conceptualize this metaphor what i picture is straight out of a cartoon
 like there 's a man  he 's walking down the sidewalk without realizing it he crosses over an open manhole and he just
 plummets into the sewer below  and i picture it this way because falling is not
 jumping 
 falling is accidental it 's uncontrollable  it 's something that happens to us without our consent 
 and this this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship
 i am a writer and i 'm also an english teacher which means i think about words for a living
 you could say that i get paid to argue that the language we use
  matters and i would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love
 maybe even most of them are a problem 
 so in love  we fall  
 we 're struck 
 we are crushed  we swoon  we burn with passion 
 love makes us crazy  and it makes us sick
 our hearts ache  and then
 they break
  so our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness 
 they do and they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable
  which is the past participle of the word smite and if you look this word up in the dictionary you will see
 that it can be defined as both grievous affliction and to be very much in love 
 i tend to associate the word smite with a very particular context which is the old
  the book of exodus alone there are sixteen references to smiting  which is the word that the bible uses for the vengeance of an angry god 
 laughter here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts 
 right so how did this happen how have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering
  and why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we
 are victims
 these are difficult questions but i have some theories 
 and to think this through i want to focus on one metaphor in particular  which is the idea of love as madness
  when i first started researching romantic love  
 i found these madness metaphors everywhere the history of western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness
 these are just a few examples  william shakespeare love is merely a madness from as you like it 
 friedrich nietzsche there is always some madness in love 
 got me looking got me looking so crazy in love 
 from the great philosopher beyonc knowles 
  i fell in love for the first time when i was twenty  and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start  
 and it was long distance for the first couple of years so for me that meant
 very high highs and very low lows  i can remember one moment in particular i was
 sitting on a bed in a hostel in south america  and i was watching the person i love
 walk out the door  and
 it was late it was nearly midnight
  gotten into an argument over dinner and when we got back to our room  he threw his things in the bag and stormed out
 while i can no longer remember what that argument was about i very clearly remember how i felt watching him leave
 i was twenty two it was my first time in the developing world  
  i was totally alone i had another week until my flight home  and i knew the name of the town that i was in and the name of the city
 that i needed to get to to fly out but i had no idea how to get around  i had no guidebook
 and very little money  and i spoke no spanish  someone more adventurous than me
 might have seen this as a moment of opportunity but i just froze  i just
 sat there  and then i burst into tears  
 but despite my panic some small voice in my head thought wow that was dramatic 
 i must really be doing this love thing right 
 because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love  and it sounds so strange to me now but at
  longed to have dramatic experiences and in that moment i was irrational and furious and devastated 
 and weirdly enough  i thought that this somehow legitimized
 the feelings i had for the guy who had just left me i think on some level i wanted to feel a little bit crazy
  this really should not be surprising considering that according to wikipedia there are eight films 
 fourteen songs  two albums and one novel with the title crazy love 
 about half an hour later he came back to our room  
 we made up we spent another mostly happy week traveling together  and then when i got home  i thought 
 that was so terrible
 and so great  this must be a real romance 
 i expected my first love to feel like madness and of course 
 it met that expectation very well but loving someone like that as if my entire well being depended on him loving me back
 was not very good for me
  i suspect this experience of love is not that unusual 
 most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love in fact there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal 
 because neurochemically speaking  romantic love and mental illness
 are not that easily distinguished  this is true
  levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with 
 yes  and
 low levels of serotonin are also associated with seasonal affective disorder and depression 
 so there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors and
 there are other studies to confirm that
 most relationships begin this way researchers believe that the low levels
 of serotonin
 is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love  
 which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain  and most of us feel this way when we first fall in love  
 but the good news is it doesn 't always
  last that long usually from a few months to a couple of years 
 when i got back from my trip to south america  i spent a lot of time alone in my room  checking my email  
 desperate to hear from the guy i loved 
 i decided
 that if my friends could not understand
  i did not need their friendship so i stopped hanging out with most of them  
 and it was probably the most unhappy year of my life  but i think i felt like it was my job to be miserable 
 because if i could be miserable then i would prove
 how much i loved him  and if i could prove it then we would have to end up together eventually
 this is the real madness because there is no cosmic rule
  rule that says that great suffering equals great reward but we talk about love as if
 this is true 
 our experiences of love are both biological and cultural
 our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain  
 and it tells us that love is painful when after a fight or a breakup that neurochemical
  reward is withdrawn  
 and in fact and maybe you 've heard this neurochemically speaking going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal  
 which i find reassuring 
 and then  our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love in this case we 're talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness
  kind of an interesting feedback loop 
 love is powerful and at times painful  and we express this in our words and stories 
 but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful
 and painful what 's interesting to me is that all of this happens
 in a culture that values lifelong monogamy it seems like we want it both ways we want
 love to feel like madness  and we want it to last an entire lifetime that sounds terrible 
 laughter to reconcile this we need to either change
 our culture or change our expectations so imagine if we were all less passive in love if we were more assertive more
 open minded more generous and instead of
 falling in love  we stepped into love  
 i know that this is asking a lot but i 'm not actually the first person to suggest this
 in their book metaphors we live by linguists mark johnson and george lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma  
  change our metaphors they argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world  and that they can even act
 as a guide for future actions like self fulfilling prophecies johnson and lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love  
 love as a collaborative
  i really like this way of thinking about love
 linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments 
 which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of or ideas contained within a given metaphor  and johnson and lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails  
 effort  compromise  patience  
  these ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long term romantic commitment but they also work well for other kinds of relationships
 short term casual polyamorous non monogamous asexual
 because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone so
 if love is a collaborative work of art
  love is an aesthetic experience love is unpredictable 
 love is creative love requires communication
 and discipline it is frustrating and emotionally demanding and love involves both joy and pain
  when i was younger  it never occurred to me that i was allowed to demand more from love that i didn 't have to just accept whatever love offered 
 when  14 year old juliet first meets or when  14 year old juliet cannot be with romeo whom she has met four days ago  
 she does not feel disappointed or angsty
 is she 
 she wants to die  
 right  and just as a refresher at this point in the play  act three of five  romeo is not dead 
 he 's alive  he 's healthy  he 's just been banished from the city
  i first read this play also at age fourteen  juliet 's suffering made sense to me 
 reframing love as something i get to create with someone i admire  
 rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent is empowering
  maddening and crushing some days  and when i feel really frustrated i have to remind myself 
 my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what i want to make together 
 this isn 't easy either  but it 's just so much better than the alternative
  which is that thing that feels like madness 
 this version of love is not about winning or losing someone 's affection 
 instead it requires that you trust your partner
 and talk about things when trusting feels difficult 
 which sounds so simple  but is actually a kind of revolutionary  radical act 
  this is because you get to stop thinking about yourself
 and what you 're gaining or losing in your relationship and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer  
 this version of love allows us to say things like hey  we 're not very good collaborators maybe this isn 't for us 
 or that relationship was shorter than i had planned  but
  beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself  
 this version of love allows us to decide what it looks like  thank you
