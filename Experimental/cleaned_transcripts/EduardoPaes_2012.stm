  great honor to be here it 's a great honor to be here talking about cities talking about
 the future of cities it 's great to be here as a mayor  i really do believe that mayors
 have the political position to really change people 's lives that 's the place to be
  and it 's great to be here as the mayor of rio  rio 's a
 beautiful city a vibrant place special place  
 actually you 're looking at a guy who has the best job in the world  
 and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio
  that 's very touching very emotional  but it was not easy to get there actually it was a very hard
  we had to beat
 the european monarchy this is juan carlos king of spain  
 we had to beat the powerful japanese with all of their technology  we had to beat the most powerful man in the world
 defending his own city
 so it was not easy at all and actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that i think fits perfectly to the situation of rio winning the olympic
  we really showed that yes  we can and really this is the reason i came here tonight   
 i came here tonight to tell you that things can be done  
 that you don 't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way that cities are a
 great challenge  it 's a difficult task to deal with cities  but with some original ways of getting things done  with some
  you can really
 get cities to be a great great place to live 
 i want you all to imagine rio  you probably think about a a city full of energy a vibrant city full of green and nobody showed that better than carlos saldanha in last year
  some parts of rio are pretty much like that but it 's not like that everywhere we 're like every big city in the world we 've got lots of people 
 pollution cars  
  lots of concrete these pictures i 'm showing here  they are some pictures from madureira it 's like the heart of the suburb in rio  
 and i want to use an example of rio that we 're doing in madureira in this region 
 to see what we should think as our first commandment  so every time you see a
 concrete jungle like that what you 've got to do is find open spaces if you don 't have open spaces you 've got to go there and open spaces  so
  go inside these open spaces
 and make it that people can get inside and use those spaces  this is going to be the third largest park in rio by june this year  
 it 's going to be a place where people can meet where you can put nature
  the temperature 's going to drop two three degrees centigrade so
 the first commandment i want to leave you tonight is a
 city of the future has to be
  every time you think of a city  you 've got to think green you 've got to think green and green  
 so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you 
 let 's think that cities are made of people  lots of people together cities are packed with people  so how do you do you move these people around when you have three point five billion people living in cities by
  's going to be six billion people  so every time you think about moving these people around you think about  high capacity transportation but there is a problem 
 high capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money  
 so what i 'm going to show here is something that was already presented in ted by the former mayor of curitiba who created that a city in brazil jaime lerner  
 and it 's something that we 're doing again lots in rio  it 's the brt the bus rapid transit so you get a bus
  simple bus that everybody knows 
 you transform it inside as a train car you use separate lanes  dedicated lanes  the contractors they don 't like that you don 't have to dig deep down 
 underground  you can build nice stations this is actually a station that we 're doing in rio again you don 't have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that this station has the same comfort the same features
  as a subway station a kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway  so spending much less money
 and doing it much faster you can really change the way people move this is a map of rio  all the lines  the colored lines you see there it 's our 
 transportation network in this present time today we only carry eighteen percent of our population in
  with the brts we 're doing again the cheapest and fastest way we 're going to move to sixty three percent of the population being carried by high capacity transportation so remember what i said 
 you don 't always have to be rich
 or powerful to get things done you can find original ways to get things done so the second commandment i want to leave you tonight is a city of the future has to deal with
  mobility and integration of its people moving to the third
 commandment and this is the most controversial one it has to do with the favelas the slums whatever you call it there are different names
 all over the world  but the point we want to make here tonight is favelas are not
  can sometimes really be a solution  if you deal with them if you put public policy inside the favelas  
 let me just show a map of rio again rio has six point three million inhabitants
 more than twenty percent one point four million live in the favelas all these red parts are favelas so you see they are spread all over the city this is a
  view of a favela in rio you see the contrast between the rich and poor  so i want to make two points here tonight
 about favelas the first one is 
 you can change from what i call a [ vicious ] circle to a virtual circle but what you 've got to do to get that is you 've got to go inside the favelas  bring in the basic 
  services mainly education and health with high quality i 'm going to give a fast example here this was an old building in a favela in rio
 name ] that we just transformed into a primary school  with high quality  
 this is primary assistance in health that we built inside a favela  again  with high quality we call it a family clinic  so the first point is bring basic services inside the favelas with high quality  
  the second point i want to make about the favelas is you 've got to open spaces in the favela bring infrastructure to the favelas to the slums wherever you are rio 
  has the aim by two thousand and twenty  to have all its favelas completely urbanized another example  this was completely packed with houses  and then we built this what we call a knowledge square this is a place with high technology
  there 3d movie  and this is the kind of change you can get for that 
 and by the end of the day you get something better than a ted prize which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela  
 so the third commandment i want to leave here tonight is a city of the future has to be socially integrated  you cannot deal with a city if it 's not socially
 integrated
  but moving to our fourth commandment i really wouldn 't be here tonight  between
 november and may rio 's completely packed 
 we just had last week carnivale  it was great it was lots of fun  we have new year 's eve there 's like two million people on copacabana beach  we have problems
  fight floods tropical rains at this time of the year  you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes
 we have problems with the tropical rains  almost every year we have these landslides which are terrible  
 but the reason i could come here is because of that  this was something we did with ibm
 that 's a little bit more than a year old it 's what we call the operations center of rio  and i wanted to show that i can govern my city using technology from
  here from long beach  so i got here last night and i know everything we 're going to speak now to the operations center  this is osorio he 's our secretary of urban affairs  
 so osorio
  good to be there with you i 've already told the people that
 we have tropical rain this time of year so how 's the weather in rio now
  of year get lots of traffic jams people get mad at the mayor so how 's the traffic tonight osario well traffic tonight is fine let me get you one of our
  streets are clear now it 's eleven zero pm in rio  
 nothing of concern in terms of traffic i 'll get to you now the incidents of the day  we had heavy traffic
 early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon  but nothing of big concern we
  're going to move so that i can make a conclusion
  okay  so
 no files this place no paperwork no distance twenty four seven working so the fourth commandment i want to share with you here tonight is a
 city of the future has to use technology to be present i don 't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city but everything that
  the commandments are means are ways for us to govern cities   invest in infrastructure invest in the green open parks open spaces integrate socially use technology  
 but at the end of the day  when we talk about cities we talk about a gathering of people  
 and we cannot see that as a problem that is fantastic if there 's three point five billion now it 's going to be six billion then it 's going to be ten billion that is great that means we 're going to have ten billion
  minds working together  ten billion talents together  so
 a city of the future 
 i really do believe that it 's a city that cares about its citizens  integrates socially its citizens  a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party  which are cities  thank you very much
