  so i grew up in limpopo on the border of limpopo and mpumalanga a little town called motetema water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather  
 and growing up in these tough situations at the age of seventeen i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter
  and we were sunbathing the limpopo sun gets really hot in winter  
 so as we were sunbathing my best friend next to me says man 
 why doesn 't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don 't have to bathe 
 and i sat and i was like man i would buy that eh so i went home  and i did a little research 
 and i found some very shocking statistics
  over two point five billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation four hundred and fifty million of them are in africa and five million of them are in south africa  
 various diseases thrive in this environment the most drastic of which is called trachoma 
 trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye  multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind
 the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year 
 the shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma  all you have to do is wash your face  no medicine no pills no injections  
 so after seeing these shocking statistics i thought to myself okay  even if i 'm not just doing it for myself and the
  with my trusty little steed my nokia six thousand two hundred and thirty four cell phone i didn 't have a laptop i didn 't have internet much  except for the 20 rand an hour internet cafe
 i did research on wikipedia on google about lotions creams the compositions the melting points the toxicities i did high school science
 and i wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper and it looked like the kfc special spice
 you know so i was like okay  so we 've got the formula ready now we need to get this thing into practice  fast forward four years later  
 after having written a  40 page business plan on the cell phone having written my patent on the cell phone i 'm the youngest
  drybath the world 's first
 lotion you literally put it on your skin and you don 't have to bathe 
 so after having tried to make it work in high school
 with the limited resources i had i went to university met a few people got it into practice  and we have a fully functioning
  product that 's ready to go to the market it 's actually available on the market  so we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making drybath available 
 one of the things we learned was that poor communities don 't buy products in bulk 
 they buy products on demand a person in alex doesn 't buy a box of cigarettes they buy one cigarette each day even though it 's more expensive
  so we packaged drybath in these innovative little sachets you just snap them in half  and you squeeze it out 
 and the cool part is one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand 
 after creating that model we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath 
 at least once a week  anyway we realized that we could save eighty million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath and also we would save
  two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas two hours more for school two hours more for homework two hours more to just be a kid 
 after seeing that global impact we narrowed it down to our key value proposition which was cleanliness and convenience 
 drybath is a rich man 's convenience and a poor man
 's lifesaver
