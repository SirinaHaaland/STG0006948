  and the food industry in general
 are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world for every calorie of food that we consume here in britain today  ten calories are taken to produce it that 's a lot 
 i want to take something rather humble to discuss
  i found this in the farmers ' market today  
 and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later you 're very welcome to the humble potato and i 've spent a long time twenty five years preparing these 
 and it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime  
 first of all it 's planted  and that takes
 energy  it grows and
  it 's then harvested
  it 's then distributed and distribution is a massive issue  it 's then sold and bought  
 and it 's then delivered to me i basically take it prepare it and then people consume it hopefully they enjoy it
 the last stage is basically waste  and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it 
 there are different types of waste there 's a waste of time there 's a waste of space
  there 's a waste of energy  and there 's a waste of waste 
 and every business i 've been working on over the past five years i 'm trying to lower each one of these elements  okay  so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like basically a restaurant just like any other this is the restaurant
 acorn house front and back so let me run you through a few ideas  floor sustainable recyclable chairs
  this is norwegian forestry commission wood  
 this bench although it was uncomfortable for my mom she didn 't like sitting on it so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale reusing a job that was pretty good  
 i hate waste especially walls  if they 're not working put a shelf on it  which i did  and that shows all the customers my products  
 the whole business is run on sustainable energy  this is powered by wind all of the lights are daylight bulbs  paint is all
 all low volume chemical which is very important when you 're working in the room all the time  
 i was experimenting with these i don 't know if you can see it but there 's a work surface there and that 's a plastic polymer  and i was thinking well i 'm trying to think nature nature nature but i thought no no experiment with resins experiment with polymers 
 will they outlive me they probably might  
 right here 's a reconditioned coffee machine it actually looks better than a brand new one so looking good there now reusing is vital
  and we filter our own water we put them in bottles  refrigerate them and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again here 's a great little example if you can see this orange tree it 's actually growing in a car tire  which 
  has been turned inside out and sewn up it 's got my compost in it which is growing an orange tree which is great 
 they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted 
 okay  it 's a small kitchen it 's about five square meters it serves two hundred and twenty people a day we generate quite a lot of waste this
 is the waste room you can 't get rid of waste  but this story 's not about
 eliminating it it 's about minimizing it in here  i have produce and boxes
  i put my food waste into this dehydrating desiccating macerator turns food into an inner material  which i can store and then compost later  
 i compost it in this garden 
 all of the soil you can see there is basically my food which is generated by the restaurant and it 's growing in these tubs which i made out of storm felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things 
 three compost bins
 go through about seventy kilos of raw vegetable waste a week really good  makes fantastic compost
 couple of wormeries in there too and actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery i had a lot of worms in it and i tried taking the dried food waste putting it to the worms going there you go  
 dinner it was like vegetable jerky and killed all of them
 i don 't know how many worms [ were ] in there but i 've got some heavy karma coming i tell you
  what you 're seeing here is a water filtration system this takes the water out of the restaurant  runs it through these
 stone beds this is going to be mint in there and i sort of water the garden with it and i ultimately want to recycle that put it back into the loos maybe wash hands with it i don 't know 
 so water is a very important aspect i
 started meditating on that and created a restaurant called waterhouse if i could get waterhouse to be a no carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with that would be great i
 managed to do it 
 this restaurant
 looks a little bit like acorn house same chairs same tables they 're all english and a little bit more sustainable 
 but this is an electrical restaurant  the whole thing is electric the restaurant and the kitchen and it 's run on hydroelectricity so i 've gone from air to water  
 now
 it 's important to understand that
 this room is is cooled by water  heated by water  filters its own water
  it literally is waterhouse the air handling system inside it i got rid of air conditioning because i thought there was too much consumption going on there 
 this is basically
 air handling i 'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism it 's turning through these amazing sails on the roof  and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant  cooling them
  or heating them as the need may be and this is an english willow air diffuser and that 's
 softly moving that air current through the room very advanced no  air conditioning i love it in the canal  which is just outside the restaurant there is
 hundreds of meters of coil piping this takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four degrees of heat exchange  i have no idea how it works but i paid a lot of money for it 
 and what 's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat it 's
  own power he 's growing all his own fruit  and that 's fantastic 
 there 's no accident in names of these restaurants acorn house is the element of wood waterhouse is the element of water 
 and i 'm thinking well i 'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five chinese
 medicine acupuncture
 specialities i 've got water and wood  i 'm just about to do
  got metal and earth to come so you 've got
 to watch your space for that 
 okay  so this is my next project five weeks old it 's my baby  and it 's hurting real bad 
 the people 's supermarket so basically 
 the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what i was doing anyway what i needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people so people i e perhaps more working class
 or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative this is a social enterprise
 not for profit cooperative supermarket  
 it really is about the social disconnect between food communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers connecting communities in london to 
  rural growers really important so i 'm committing to potatoes i 'm committing to milk i 'm committing to leeks and broccoli all very important stuff  
  i 've kept the floors i 've kept the trunking i 've got in some recycled fridges i 've got some recycled tills i 've got some recycled trolleys i mean the whole thing is is super sustainable in fact i 'm trying and i 'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world 
 that 's zero food waste  and no one 's doing that just yet in fact sainsbury 's if you 're watching let 's have a
 go try it on i 'm going to get there before you  so
 nature
  doesn 't create waste as such  
 everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning  and that 's been something that 's been nurturing me for some time and it 's an important
 statement to understand if we don 't stand up and make a difference and
 think about sustainable food think about the sustainable nature of it then we
  i wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we 're more responsible
  environmentally conscious businesses are doable they 're here you can see i 've done three so far i 've got a few more to go
 the idea is embryonic  i think it 's important i think that if we reduce  reuse  refuse and recycle right at the end there recycling is
 the last point i want to make but it 's the four r 's rather than the three r 's then i think we 're going to be
  on our way  so these three are not perfect
 they 're ideas  i think that there are many problems to come  but with help i 'm sure i 'm going to find solutions and
 i hope you all take part
