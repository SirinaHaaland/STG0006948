  i dedicated the past two years to understanding how people achieve their dreams  
 when we think about the dreams we have and the dent we want to leave in the universe it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is
 between the dreams that we have and projects that never happen
 laughter so i 'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not to follow your dreams 
 one 
 believe in overnight success  you know the story right 
 the tech guy built a mobile app and sold it very fast for a lot of money  
 you know the story may seem
  i bet it 's incomplete if you go investigate further the guy has done thirty apps before and he has done a master 's on the topic a phd 
 he has been working on the topic for
 twenty years this
 is really interesting i myself have a story in brazil that people think is an overnight success  i come from a humble family  
 and two weeks before the deadline to apply for mit i started the application process
  got in 
 people may think it 's an overnight success  but that only worked because for the seventeen years prior to that i took life and education seriously 
 your overnight success story is always a result of everything you 've done in your life through that moment 
 believe someone else has the answers for you constantly people want to help out right 
 all sorts of people your family your friends your business partners they all have opinions on which path you should take and let me tell you go through this pipe 
 but whenever you go inside there are other ways you have to pick as well  and you need to make those decisions yourself 
 no one else has the perfect answers for your life 
 and you need to keep picking those decisions right the pipes are infinite and you 're going to bump
  your head and it 's a part of the process  
 three  and it 's very subtle but very important  
 decide to settle when growth is guaranteed so when your life is going great 
 you have put together a great team  and you have growing revenue and everything is set time to settle 
 when i launched my first book  i worked really really hard to distribute it everywhere in brazil
  with that over three million people downloaded it over fifty thousand people bought physical copies when i wrote a sequel  some impact was guaranteed  
 even if i did little  sales would be ok  
 but ok is never ok  when you 're growing towards a peak  you need to work harder than ever and find yourself another
  maybe if i did little a couple hundred thousand people would read it and that 's great already  
 but if i work harder than ever i can bring this number up to millions 
 that 's why i decided with my new book to go to every single state of brazil  and i can already see a higher peak  there 's no time to settle down  
 fourth tip  and that 's really important  believe the fault is someone else 's 
 i constantly see people saying
  great idea  but no investor had the vision to invest oh i created this great product  but the market is so bad the sales didn 't go well or i can 't find good talent my team is so below expectations 
 if you have dreams it 's your responsibility to make them happen  yes  it may be hard
  the market may be bad  but if no one invested in your idea  if no one bought your product for sure there is something there that is your fault 
 laughter definitely you need to get your dreams and make them happen  and no one
 achieved their goals alone  but if you didn 't make them happen  it 's your fault
 and no one else 's be responsible for your dreams and one last tip
  and this one is really important as well
  believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves  once i saw an ad  
 and it was a lot of friends they were going up a mountain it was a very high mountain  and it was a lot of work  you could see that they were sweating and this was tough  and they were going up  
  life is never about the goals themselves life is about the journey  
 yes  you should enjoy the goals themselves  but people think that you have dreams and whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams it 's a magical place where happiness will be all around
 but achieving a dream is a momentary sensation  and your life is not 
 the only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey 
 that 's the best way and your journey is simple it 's made of steps some steps will be right on  sometimes you will trip
  if it 's right on celebrate  because some people wait a lot to celebrate  and if you tripped  turn that into something to learn if every step
 becomes something to learn or something to celebrate  you will for sure enjoy the journey  
 so five tips  believe in overnight success  believe someone else has the answers for you believe that when growth is guaranteed
  you should settle down  believe the fault is someone else 's and believe that only the goals themselves matter believe me you do that and you will destroy your dreams
