  a public dewey long ago observed is constituted through discussion and debate 
 if we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question 
 and avoid doxa  the realm of the unquestioned
  then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion 
 it is in this spirit that i join
 into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time namely how to mobilize
 different forms of capital for the project of state building to put the assumptions very clearly capitalism
  after one hundred and fifty years has become acceptable and so has democracy 
 if we looked in the world of one thousand nine hundred and forty five and looked at the map
 of capitalist economies and democratic polities they were the rare exception not the norm  
 the question now however is both about which form of
  capitalism
 and which type of democratic participation  but we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about
 a rare consensus of assumptions and that provides the ground for a type of action because consensus of each moment
  allows us to act  and it is necessary  no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus 
 consensus to be able to move forward  but the majority of the world
 neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems 
 most of the globe experiences the state
 as repressive as an organization that is concerned about
  denial of rights about denial of justice  rather than provision of it 
 and in terms of experience of capitalism there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences first extractive industry 
 blood diamonds  smuggled emeralds 
  that is cut right from under the poorest second is technical assistance and technical assistance might shock you but it 's the worst form
 of today of the ugly face
 of the of the developed world to the developing countries  
 tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to one thousand five hundred dollars a day  
 who are incapable
  of thinking creatively  or organically  
 next assumption
 and of course the events of july seven  i express my deep sympathy and before that september eleven have reminded us we do not live
 in three different worlds we live in one world 
  that 's easily said  but we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in  
 and that is that if we want to have one world this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion  
 and then inclusion for some 
 we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world
  in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope  
 otherwise we will be missing
 this open moment in history  where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics 
 what is one of these organizations to pick we have three critical terms economy
  civil society
 and the state i will not deal with those first two except to say
 that uncritical transfer of assumptions from one context to another can only make for disaster  
 economics
 taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context my
  is dominated by drug economy and a mafia  
 textbook economics does not work in my context  and i have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy  
 the poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward  
 and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling for which i have enormous
  respect  my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best 
 second  
 instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state  why don 't we simplify
 and say what are a series of functions
 that the state in the 21st century must perform clare lockhart and i are writing a book on this we hope to share that much widely with and third is that
 we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively
 how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places  
 so what are these functions we propose ten  and
 it 's legitimate monopoly of means of violence administrative control  management of public finances investment in human capital provision of citizenship rights  
 provision of infrastructure
  management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation 
 creation of the market international agreements including public borrowing  and then most importantly  rule of law  
 i won 't elaborate  i hope the questions will
 give me an opportunity 
 this is a feasible goal  basically because contrary to widespread assumption i would argue that we know how to do this who would have imagined
  that germany would be either united or democratic today  if you looked at it from the perspective of oxford of one thousand nine hundred and forty three 
 but people at oxford prepared for a democratic germany and engaged in planning  and there are lots of other examples 
 now in order to do this and this brings this group we have to rethink the notion of
  capital
 capital  the least important form of capital in this project is financial capital money  
 money is not capital in most of the developing countries it
 's just cash because it lacks the institutional organizational managerial forms to turn it into capital 
 and what is
 required is
  combination of physical capital institutional capital human capital
 and security of course is critical but so is information 
 now the issue that should concern us here and that 's the challenge that i would like to to pose to this group
 is again it takes sixteen years
 in your countries to produce
  somebody with a b s degree  
 it takes twenty years to produce somebody with a ph d the first challenge is to rethink fundamentally
  the issue
 of
 the time do we need to repeat
 the modalities that we have inherited our educational systems are inherited from
 what is it that we need to do fundamentally to re engage in a project that capital formation is rapid  
 the absolute majority of the world 's population are below twenty and they are growing larger and faster 
 they need different ways of being approached different ways of being enfranchised
 different ways of being skilled  
 and that 's the the first thing second is you 're problem solvers  but you 're not engaging your global responsibility 
 you 've stayed away from the problems of corruption  you only want clean environments in which to function
  if you don 't think through the problems of corruption who will 
 you stay away from design for development you 're great designers  but your designs are selfish 
 it 's for your own immediate use the world in which i operate operates with designs
 regarding roads or dams  or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in sixty years
  this is not right it requires thinking but particularly what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination
 to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work 
 as the work on paradigms long time ago showed
  thomas kuhn 's work
 it 's in the intersection of ideas that new developments true breakthroughs occur  
 and i hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state
 and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world 's poor through this means thank you
  you were the finance minister of afghanistan a country right at the middle of much of the world 's agenda is the country gonna make it will democracy flourish what scares you most ashraf ghani 
 what scares me most is
 is you lack of your engagement 
  you asked me you know i always give the unconventional answer 
 no but seriously  
 the issue of afghanistan first has to be seen as at least a 10 to  20 year perspective 
 today the world of globalization is on speed 
 time has been compressed and space does not exist for most people  but in my world you know when i went back to afghanistan after
  space had expanded  every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down  i rode traveled travel between two cities that used to take
 three hours now took twelve
  so the first is when the scale is that we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure
 it takes six years
  any meaningful sort of thing
  but the modality of attention 
 or what is happening today what 's happening tomorrow  second is when a country has been subjected
 to one of the most immense  brutal forms of exercise of power we had the red army for ten continuous years one hundred and ten
  every afghan
 sees the sky as a source of fear we were bombed
 practically out of existence  
 then  tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism
 from all sides  the united states great britain joined
  for instance  egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism 
 how to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror 
 how to turn a donkey a carthorse anything 
 and the russians equally  so when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan it 's because of that legacy
  have to understand that we 've been incredibly lucky i mean i really can 't believe how lucky i am here standing
 in front of you speaking when i joined as finance minister  i thought that the chances of my living
 more than three years would not be more than five percent 
  i think we can make it and the reason we can make it is because of the people  
 you see because i mean i give you one statistic  ninety one percent of the men in afghanistan eighty six percent of the women 
 listen to at least three radio stations a day 
 in terms of their discourse in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world  
 i think that i would dare say they 're much more sophisticated
 than rural americans with college degrees
 and the bulk of europeans
 because the world matters to them and what is their predominant concern abandonment
  become deeply internationalist
  when i went back in december of two thousand and one i had absolutely no desire to work with the afghan government because i 'd lived as a nationalist  
 and i told them my people with the americans here
 separate separate  yes i have an
 advisory position with the u n 
 i went through ten afghan provinces very rapidly  and everybody was telling me it was a different world you know  they engage they see engagement 
  to the future of the ordinary people 
 and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is clare lockhart is here so i 'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan  
 and that woman said she didn 't care whether she had food on her table what she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future  where her children
 could really have a different life that gives me hope
  to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade ag certainly well
 the first is instead of sending a billion dollars
 on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies they should give this hundred billion dollars
 to fifty of the most critically innovative companies in the world
  to ask them to create one million jobs  
 the key to the drug eradication is jobs look there 's a very little known fact countries that have a legal average income per capita of one thousand dollars don 't produce drugs 
 second  textile trade is the key not aid 
  and europe should give us a zero percent tariff
  the textile industry is incredibly mobile  if you want us to be able to compete with china and to attract investment we could probably
 attract four to six billion dollars
 quite easily in  the textile sector if there was zero tariffs
 would create the type of job  cotton does not compete with with opium a
  we need to understand it 's the value chain  look the ordinary afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit  
 it is important  but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro production want is global access  
 they don 't want to sell to the charity bazaars
 that are only for foreigners and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again
  what we want is a partnership with the italian design firms
   yeah we have the best embroiderers in the world  
 why can 't we do what was done with northern italy with the put out system
  so i think economically the critical issue really is to now think through and what i will say here is that aid doesn
  is broken  
 the aid system does not have the knowledge the vision the ability  i 'm all for it  
 after all i raised a lot of it yeah to be exact you know i managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country twenty seven point five billion  they didn 't want to give us
