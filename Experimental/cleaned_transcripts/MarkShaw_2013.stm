  i 'm here to show you how something you can 't see can be so much fun to look at you 're about to experience
 a new  available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives what i have here is a cinder block
  that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material  it 's called ultra ever dry  and
 when you apply it to any material it turns into a superhydrophobic shield  
 so this is a cinder block  uncoated  and you can see that it 's porous it absorbs water 
  so what 's superhydrophobic 
 superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface the rounder it is the more hydrophobic it is 
 and if it 's really round it 's superhydrophobic 
 a freshly waxed car the water molecules slump to about ninety degrees
  a windshield coating is going to give you about one hundred and ten degrees  but what you 're seeing here is one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy five degrees and anything over one hundred and fifty is superhydrophobic  
 so as part of the demonstration what i have is a pair of gloves  and we 've coated one of the gloves
 with the nanotechnology coating  and let 's see if you can tell which one and i 'll give you a hint
  you guess the one that was dry  
 when you have nanotechnology and and
 nanoscience what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits and we
 're talking really small here the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers  and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter  and to put some scale to that
  you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick  and you put it side by side and you had fifty thousand of them you 'd be the width of a human hair  
 so very small  but very useful 
 and it 's not just water that this works with it 's a lot of
 you can see the difference  
 moving onto the next demonstration we 've taken a pane of glass and we 've coated the outside of it we 've framed it with the nanotechnology coating 
 and we 're going to pour this  green tinted water inside the middle  and you 're going to see it 's going to spread out on glass like you 'd normally think it would except when it hits the coating
  it stops  and i can 't even coax it to leave  
 it 's that afraid of the water 
 so what 's going on here what 's happening well  the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles 
  that form a very rough and craggly surface you 'd think it 'd be smooth but it 's actually not and it has
  and those spaces
 along with the nanoparticles  reach up and grab the air molecules and cover the surface with air it 's an umbrella of air all across it  
 and that layer of air is what the water hits the mud hits the concrete hits  and it glides right off  
 so if i put this inside this water here you can see a silver reflective
  coating around it and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that 's protecting the water from touching the paddle  and it 's dry
 so what are the applications i
 mean many of you right now are probably going through your head everyone that sees this gets excited and says oh i could use it for this and this and this 
 the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's  anti wetting we 've certainly seen that today  
 it could be anything that 's
 because if you don 't have water you don 't have ice  it could be 
 no water  no corrosion  it could be 
 without water the bacteria won 't survive  and it could be things that need to be
  field of work  and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration  but before i do that i would like to say thank you and think small
  about us cutting out the design from ted
