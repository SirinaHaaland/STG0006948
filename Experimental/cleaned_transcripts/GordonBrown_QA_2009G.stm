  would you describe that as
 global citizenship is that an idea that you believe in and how would you define that gordon brown
 it is about global citizenship and recognizing our responsibilities to others there is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world 
 and there is so much shared sense of what we need to do that it is vital that we all come together  but we don
  necessarily have the means means to do so so there are challenges to be met 
 i believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents  but of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work 
 but i don 't think we should underestimate the extent to which
 massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people of people across the world
  about this idea of global citizenship but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism and how to
 combine these two i mean you 're elected as prime minister with a brief to
 bat for britain
  how do you reconcile the two things gb 
 well of course national identity remains remains important  but it 's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities  and i think
  problems of recession is that people become
 more protectionist they look in on themselves  they try to protect their own nation perhaps
 at the expense of other nations  when you actually look at the motor of the world economy  
 it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries and any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of
  getting the benefits
 of growth in the world economy so
 you 've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism that 's absolutely important  but you 've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally  and the problems we have cannot be solved by one one nation and one nation alone ca well indeed  but
 what do you do when the two come into conflict and you 're forced to make a decision that either is in britain 's interest or the interest of
  britons or citizens elsewhere in the world gb well i think we can persuade people that
 that what is necessary for for britain 's long term interests what is necessary for america 's long term interests is proper engagement with the rest of the world
 and taking the action that is
  ghana becomes independent so it is just over fifty years ago  richard nixon goes to represent the united states government
 at the celebrations for independence in ghana
 and it 's one of his first outings as vice president to an african country he doesn 't quite know what to do so he starts going around the crowd and
  and he says to people in this rather unique way 
 how does it feel to be free and he 's going around how does it feel to be free how does it feel to be free and then someone says how should i know  i come from alabama
  remarkable is socioeconomic rights in africa have not moved forward
 very fast even since the age of
 of colonialism  
 and yet  
 america and africa have got a common interest and we have got to realize that if we don 't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in africa to
  together for common causes 
 then the danger of al qaeda and related groups making progress in africa is very big so i would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism in relation to africa or in relation to developing countries 
 is more than that it is enlightened self interest for us to work with other countries  and i would say that national interest
 and if you like what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change
 do
  in the long run come together  and whatever the short run price for taking action on climate change or on security or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education 
 these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people
 feel able to feel comfortable with each other
 and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries
  comes through that
 there 's been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach one end of the beach there is a house
 containing a family of five nigerians  and at the other end of the beach
 there is a single brit  you have time to you have time to to alert one house what do you do
  i do agree that that my responsibility is first of all to make sure
 that people in our country are safe and i wouldn 't like anything that is said today to suggest that i am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that
  leader has for their own country  
 but i 'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before 
 but the power to communicate across borders allows us to organize the world in a different way
 and i think look at the tsunami it 's a classic example where was the early warning systems  
 where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose
 from the potential for earthquakes as well as the potential for climate change
  and when the world starts to work together with better early warning systems you can deal with some of these problems in a better way  i just think we 're not seeing at the moment the huge opportunities open to us
 by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience
 which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems ca but i think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot of
 people have like people in the audience here where we love
 the kind of language that you 're talking about  it is inspiring a lot of us believe that that has to be the world 's future 
 and yet  when the situation changes you suddenly hear politicians talking as if you know for example  the life of one american soldier is worth countless numbers of
  i 'm just wondering
 whether you can see that changing over time whether you see in britain that there are changing attitudes and that people are actually more supportive of the of the kind of
 global ethic that you talk about gb i think every religion
  and i 'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion it has this global ethic at the center of its its credo  and whether it 's
 jewish or whether it 's muslim or whether it 's hindu or whether it 's sikh the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these
 religions so  i think you 're dealing with something that people instinctively
 see as part of their moral sense so you 're building on something that is not
 pure
 you 're building on people 's ideas and values
 that perhaps they 're candles that
 that burn very dimly on on certain occasions  but it is a set set of values that cannot in my view be extinguished then the question is 
 how do you make that that change happen  how do you persuade people that it is in their interest
 to build strong
  after the second world war we built institutions the united nations  the imf the world bank 
 the world trade organization the marshall plan there was a period in which people talked about
 an act of creation because these institutions were so new but they are now out of date they don 't deal with the problems you can 't deal with the environmental problem through existing institutions you can 't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to you can 't deal with the
  economic and financial problem so we have got to rebuild our global institutions build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time
  and i believe that if you if you look at the biggest challenge we face it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build
 a truly global society with the institutions that that are founded on these rules so  i come back to my initial initial point sometimes you think things are impossible  nobody would have said fifty
  years ago that apartheid would have gone in one thousand nine hundred and ninety or that the berlin wall would have fallen
 at the turn of the ' 80s and ' 90s or that polio could be eradicated or perhaps sixty years ago nobody would have said a man could gone to the moon all these things have happened by tackling the impossible you make the impossible possible 
 ca and we have had a
  is for someone to say i believe that the life of every human on the planet is worth the same equal consideration 
 regardless of nationality
 and religion  and you have politicians who have you 're elected in a way you can 't say that even if as a human being you believe that
 you can 't say that you 're elected for britain 's interests gb we have a responsibility to protect i mean
 look one thousand nine hundred and eighteen
  the treaty of versailles  and all the treaties before that the treaty of westphalia and everything else were about protecting the sovereign right of countries to do what they want 
 since then the world has moved forward
  partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust and people 's concern about the rights of individuals within territories
 where they need protection  partly because of what we saw in rwanda  partly because of what we saw in bosnia 
 the idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk
 is now being established as a principle which governs the world
  to the aid of any citizen of any country in danger i can say
 that britain is in a position where we 're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack is something that is accepted by the whole world now in the end that can
  only be achieved if your international institutions work well enough to be able to to do so
 and that comes back to what the future role of the united nations  and what it can do actually is but the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is in a sense taken over from the idea 
  as the principle governing the international community ca can you picture in our lifetimes a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of
 i believe that that all
 people across the the planet have equal consideration and if in power we will act in in that way  and we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that ethic gb 
 that not what we 're doing in the debate about climate change we 're saying
  you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country you 've got to involve all countries  you 're saying that you must  
 and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves  
 you 're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we 're all bound together
 to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world
  we 've never had this before because kyoto didn 't work if you could get a deal at copenhagen
  where people agreed a that there was a  long term target for carbon emission cuts b that there was short range targets that had to be met so this wasn 't just abstract it was people actually making decisions 
  now that would make a difference now  and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many many years and decades
  that they can move to energy efficient technologies and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions 
 then you are treating
 the world
 equally 
 by giving consideration to every part of the of the planet and the needs they have it doesn 't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing because we 've actually got to do more financially to help the poorest
  countries  but it does mean there is equal consideration for for the needs of citizens in in a single planet ca yes 
 and then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own
 individual interests gb yes but i think europe has got a position which is twenty seven countries have already come come together  
 i mean the great difficulty in europe is if if you 're at a meeting and
  it takes a very very long time  but we did get an agreement on climate change america has made its first disposition on this with
 the bill that president obama should be congratulated for for getting through congress 
 japan has made an announcement china and india have signed up to the scientific evidence 
  but more progress has been made i think in the last few weeks than had been made for some years and i do
 believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together we can get that agreement to copenhagen  i certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific
  and we would help them adapt and
 we would help them make the transition to a low carbon economy  
 i do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this when the imf was created in the 1940s 
 it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world 's gdp the imf now has limited resources one percent it can 't really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis  so we 've got to rebuild rebuild the world
  a big task persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so there is a story told about the three world leaders
 of the day getting a chance to get some some advice from god and the story is told that bill clinton went to god and
 he asked when there will be successful climate change and a
  and god shook his head and said not this year not this decade perhaps not even in [ your ] lifetime and bill clinton
 walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted and then the story is that barroso the president of the european commission went to
 god and he asked when will we get a recovery of global 
 god said not this year not in this decade perhaps not not in your
  of the united nations came up to speak to god and said when will our international institutions work 
 and god cried
 it is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves
 that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build ca prime minister i think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made
 in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into
  and there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic  thank you so much for coming to ted
