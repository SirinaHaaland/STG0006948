  president theodore roosevelt needed a little break from the white house so he took a train to mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called 
  the first day of the hunt they didn 't see a single bear so it was a big bummer for everyone but
 the second day the dogs cornered one
 after a really long chase but by that point the president had given up and gone back to camp for lunch so his hunting guide
 cracked the animal on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle  and then tied it up to a tree
 and started tooting away on his bugle to call roosevelt back so he could have the honor of shooting
  and when roosevelt saw this animal tied up to the tree he just couldn 't bring himself to fire at it he felt like that would go against his code as a sportsman a
 few days later the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in washington 
  it was called drawing a line in mississippi and it showed roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out sparing the bear 's life 
 and the bear was sitting on its hind legs with these two big frightened wide eyes and little ears
 pricked up at the top of its head it looked really helpless like you just wanted to
 sweep it up into your arms and reassure it it wouldn 't have looked familiar at the time but if you go looking for the cartoon now you recognize the animal right away it
 's a teddy bear  and this is how
  teddy bear was born essentially toymakers took the bear from the cartoon turned it into a plush toy and then named it after president roosevelt
 teddy 's bear and i do feel a little ridiculous that i 'm up here on this stage
 and i 'm choosing to use my time to tell you about a 100 year old story about the invention of a squishy kid 's toy  
 but i 'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear  
 inside that story is a more important story a story about how dramatically our ideas about
  nature can change and also about how on the planet right now  the stories that we tell are dramatically changing nature 
 because think about the teddy bear  for us in retrospect it feels like an obvious fit because bears are so cute and cuddly and who wouldn 't want to give one to their kids to play with but the truth is that in one thousand nine hundred and two 
 bears weren 't cute and cuddly i mean they looked the same but no one thought of them that way
  were monsters bears were something that that frickin ' terrified kids 
 for generations at that point  the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger that people were encountering on the frontier and the federal government was actually systematically exterminating bears and lots of other predators too like coyotes and wolves 
 these animals they were being demonized they were called murderers because they killed people 's livestock one government biologist
  explained this war on animals like the bear by saying that they no longer had a place in our advancing civilization  
 and so we were just clearing them out of the way 
 in one 10 year period  close to half a million wolves had been slaughtered the grizzly would soon be wiped out from ninety five percent of its
  whereas once there had been thirty million bison moving across the plains and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks 
 now by one thousand nine hundred and two there were maybe less than one hundred left in the wild  
 and so what i 'm saying is the teddy bear was born into the middle of this great spasm of extermination
  and you can see it as a sign that maybe some people deep down were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing  
 america still hated the bear and feared it  but all of a sudden america also wanted to give the bear a great big hug  
 so this is something that i 've been really curious about in the last few years how do we imagine animals how do we think and feel about them and how do their reputations
 get written and then rewritten in our minds
  here living in the eye of a great storm of extinction where half the species on the planet could be gone by the end of the century  
 and so why is it that we come to care about some of those species and not others  
 well there 's a new field a relatively new field of social science that started looking at these questions and trying to unpack the powerful and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships that we have to animals 
 and i spent a lot of time looking through their academic journals and all i can really say is that their findings are
  some of my favorites include that the more television a person watches in upstate new york the more he or she is afraid of being attacked by a black bear 
 if you show a tiger to an american they 're much more likely to assume that it 's female and not male in a study where a fake snake and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road drivers 
  hit the snake much more often than the turtle and about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals seemed to do it on purpose
  likely than men to get a magical feeling when they see dolphins in the surf sixty eight percent of mothers with high feelings of entitlement and self esteem 
 identified with the dancing cats in a commercial for purina 
 americans consider lobsters more important than pigeons but also much much stupider wild turkeys are seen as
  only slightly more dangerous than sea otters and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs  
 so some of this is physical right we tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us and especially that resemble human babies so with big forward facing eyes and circular faces kind of a
 roly poly posture this is why if you get a christmas card from like your great aunt in minnesota there 's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it and not something like a glacier bay wolf spider 
  there 's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals and we 're telling stories about these animals and like all stories 
 they are shaped by the times and the places in which we 're telling them so think about that moment back in one thousand nine hundred and two again where a ferocious bear became a teddy bear what
 was the context well  america was urbanizing for the first time  nearly a majority of people lived in cities so there was a growing distance between us
  was a safe space where we could reconsider the bear and romanticize it nature could only start to seem this pure and adorable because we didn 't have to be afraid of it anymore and
 you can see that cycle playing out again and again with all kinds of animals it seems like we 're always stuck between demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out and then when we get very close to doing that 
 empathizing with it as an underdog and wanting to show it compassion  
 so for example this is one of probably thousands of letters and drawings that kids sent to the bush administration begging it to protect the polar bear under the endangered species act and these were sent
 back in the mid 2000s when awareness of climate change was suddenly surging we kept seeing that image of a polar bear stranded on a little ice floe looking really morose i
 days looking through these files i really love them this one 's my favorite if you can see it 's a polar bear that 's drowning and then it 's also being eaten simultaneously by a lobster and a shark 
 this one came from a kid named fritz and he 's actually got a solution to climate change he 's got it all worked out to an ethanol based solution he says i feel bad about the polar bears i like polar bears 
 everyone can use corn juice for cars from fritz
  two hundred years ago you would have arctic explorers writing about polar bears leaping into their boats and trying to devour them even if they lit the bear on fire  but these kids don 't see the polar bear that way and actually 
 they don 't even see the polar bear the way that that i did back in the ' 80s i mean we thought of these animals as mysterious and terrifying lords of the arctic 
  and when you think about it that 's kind of the conclusion to the story that the teddy bear started telling back in one thousand nine hundred and two 
 because back then america had more or less conquered its share of the continent we were just getting around to polishing off these last wild predators 
 now  society 's reach has expanded all the way to the top of the world  and it 's made even
  the most remote the most powerful bears on the planet seem like adorable and blameless victims  
 but you know there 's also a postscript to the teddy bear story that not a lot of people talk about we
 're going to talk about it because even though it didn 't really take long after roosevelt 's hunt in one thousand nine hundred and two for the toy to become a  full blown craze 
 most people figured it was a fad it was a sort of silly political novelty item and it would go away once the president left office  and so by one thousand nine hundred and nine when roosevelt 's successor
  william howard taft was getting ready to be inaugurated the toy industry was on the hunt for the next big thing
  they didn 't do too well 
 that january  taft was the guest of honor at a banquet in atlanta  
 and for days in advance the big news was the menu they were going to be serving him a southern specialty a delicacy
  a whole opossum roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes and then sometimes they 'd leave the big tail on it like a big meaty noodle 
 the one brought to taft 's table weighed eighteen pounds  
 so after dinner the orchestra started to play and the guests burst into song  and all of a sudden taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from
  and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the william taft presidency 's answer to teddy roosevelt 's teddy bear  
 they were calling it
 the billy possum
  hours  the georgia billy possum company was up and running brokering deals for these things nationwide  and the los angeles times announced very confidently
  bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear  and for four years possibly eight  
 the children of the united states will play with billy possum 
 so from that point there was a fit of opossum fever there were billy possum postcards billy possum pins billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time there were smaller billy possums on a stick that kids could wave
  even with all this marketing  the life of the billy possum
 turned out to be just pathetically brief  
 the toy was an absolute flop  and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year  
 and what that means is that the billy possum didn 't even make it to christmastime which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a toy
 so we can explain that failure two ways  the first well it 's pretty obvious i 'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway opossums are hideous
 but maybe more importantly is that the story of the billy possum was all wrong  especially compared to the backstory of the teddy bear  
 think about it for most of human 's evolutionary history what 's made bears impressive to us has been their complete independence from us  it 's that they live these parallel lives
 as menaces and competitors by the time roosevelt went hunting in mississippi that
  stature was being crushed  
 and the animal that he had roped to a tree really was a symbol for all bears 
 whether those animals lived or died now was entirely up to the compassion or the indifference of people 
 that said something really ominous about the future of bears  
 but it also said something very unsettling
  about who we 'd become if the survival of even an animal like that was up to us now  
 so now a century later if you 're at all paying attention to what 's happening in the environment you feel that discomfort so much more intensely we
 're living now in an age of what scientists have started to call conservation reliance and what that term means is that we 've disrupted so much that nature can 't possibly stand on its own anymore  and most endangered species are only going to survive
 if we stay out there in the landscape
  riggging the world around them in their favor  so we 've gone hands on and we can 't ever take our hands off 
 and that 's a hell of a lot of work  
 right now  we 're training condors not to perch on power lines 
 we teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter behind little ultra light airplanes we
 're out there feeding
 plague vaccine to ferrets  we monitor pygmy rabbits
 with drones  so we 've gone from annihilating species
 to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species indefinitely  
 and which ones well the ones that we 've told compelling stories about the ones we 've decided ought to stick around 
 the line between conservation
 and domestication
  the stories that we tell
  the endangered species act
