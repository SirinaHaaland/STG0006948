  thank you so much i 'm going to try to take you on
 a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins since we are such a visual species  it 's hard for us to really understand this so i 'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it but let 's also think as a visual
  species what it 's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look
 underwater we really can 't see very far our vision which works so well in air all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic  
 and what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another dolphins and toothed whales use
  echolocation they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient they can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat 
 all marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch  so the large baleen whales will produce long beautiful songs  which are used in reproductive advertisement
 for male and females both to find one another and to select a mate
 and mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another so sound is really critical for their lives  
 the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals whose world was so foreign to me 
 was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds and i mentioned i 'll use some visual representations of sounds here 's the first example this is a plot of frequency
  against time sort of like musical notation where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower and time goes this way  
 this is a picture of a trainer 's whistle a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it 's done the right thing and can come get a fish  it sounds sort of like tweeeeeet like that
 this is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer 's whistle
 if you hummed this tune to your dog or
  cat and it hummed it back to you you ought to be pretty surprised very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds  it 's really important for our music and our language 
  so it 's a puzzle the few other mammal groups that do this why do they do it a lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand
  use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communication systems  so let 's start with calls of a nonhuman primate  many mammals 
  have to produce contact calls when say a mother and calf are apart this is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys
 signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch each individual here has a radically different call they can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals 
 how about the setting in which animals need to use this call well let 's look at mothers and calves in normal life for mother and calf dolphin they 'll often drift apart or swim apart if mom is chasing a fish
  and when they separate
 they have to get back together again  what this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle against the maximum distance so when dolphins are separating 
  by less than twenty meters less than half the time they need to use whistles most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around  but all of the time when they separate by more than one 
  hundred meters they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again  
  whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of of a dolphin but there are some exceptions when a male dolphin leaves mom 
 it will often join up with another male and form an alliance which may last for decades  as these two animals form a social bond 
 their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar this plot shows two members of a pair as you can see at the top here
  share an up sweep like woop woop woop they both have that kind of up sweep whereas these members of a pair go 
 and what 's happened is they 've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group it 's a very interesting way that they can
 form a new identifier for the new social group that they 've had let 's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about
  protecting dolphins
 from human disturbance anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded and clearly his behavior is being disrupted this is a bad situation  
 but it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away  the dolphins will start whistling they 'll change what they 're doing they 'll have a more cohesive group wait for the boat to go by and then they 'll get back
  to normal business  well in a place like sarasota florida  the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes  
 so even in the situation that doesn 't look as bad as this it 's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work 
 and if we look at a very pristine environment like western australia
  lars bider has done work
 comparing dolphin behavior and distribution
 before there were
 dolphin watching boats when there was one boat not much of an impact and two boats when the second boat was added what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area 
  completely of the ones that stayed their reproductive rate declined so it could have a negative impact on the whole population 
  about activities that we thought were benign we may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems i
 'd also like to point out that sound doesn 't
 obey boundaries  so you can draw a line to try to protect an area  but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area  and i 'd like to switch now from this local 
  environment to to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean  this is a kind of map we 've all been looking at the world is mostly blue but i
 'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think  notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land 
 to me the most mind bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where
 oceanographers took a ship to the southern indian ocean deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound that same sound
 traveled to the west and could be heard in bermuda  
 and traveled to the east  and could be heard in monterey the same sound so we live in a world of satellite communication are used to global communication  but it 's still amazing to me
  has properties that allow low frequency sound
 to basically move globally  the acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours it 's nearly halfway around the globe
 in the early ' 70s roger payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that
 sound could transmit over these large areas but very few biologists
 believed it
  it actually turns out though  even though we 've only known of long range propagation for a few decades  the whales clearly have evolved over tens of millions of years 
  a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean  so blue whales and fin whales produce very low frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges the top plot here shows
  songs and they appear to play a role in reproduction sort of like that of song birds down below here we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges  
 the biologists continued to be skeptical of the long range communication issue well past the ' 70s until the end of the cold war  
 what happened was during the cold war the u s navy had a system that was secret at the time
 that they used to track russian submarines  it had deep underwater microphones or hydrophones cabled to shore all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole north atlantic  
 and after the berlin wall fell the navy made these systems available to whale 
 to see what they could hear  this is a plot from christopher clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by bermuda
  went down to the latitude of miami and came back again it was tracked for for forty three days swimming one thousand seven hundred kilometers or more than one thousand miles  this shows us both 
  that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles they 're ocean based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated
  fins and blues which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans 
 the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds so they can make a sound that 's a little higher in frequency broader band and more complicated so you 're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here
 humpbacks when they
 develop the ability to sing this song  they 're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what
  i described  
 this means that humpback song is a form of animal culture just like music for humans would be i
 think one of the most interesting examples of this comes from australia  
 biologists on the east coast of australia were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area  and this orange line here marks the typical songs
  they all sang the normal song  but in ' ninety six they heard a few weird songs and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales 
 the west coast calls became more and more popular  until by one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight none of the whales sang the east coast song it was completely gone they just sang the cool new west coast song 
  it 's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old fashioned style before and with no golden oldies stations
  nobody sang the old ones i 'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls 
 now you are listening to a recording made by chris clark zero point two miles away from a humpback 
 you can hear the full frequency range it 's quite loud  you sound very nearby the next recording you 're going to
 hear was made of the same humpback song fifty miles away that 's shown down here  you only hear the
  low frequencies you hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long range in the ocean and is not quite as loud now
 after i play back these humpback calls i 'll play blue whale calls but they have to be sped up because they 're so low in frequency
 that you wouldn 't be able to hear it otherwise here 's a blue whale call at fifty
  is the sound of a ship and i 'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it imagine that whale
  listening from five hundred miles there 's
 a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other 
 now this is something that 's been known for quite a while  this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound and on the y axis is the loudness of of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency 
  in the low frequencies  this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth 
 up high these variable lines indicate increasing noise in this frequency range from higher wind and wave  but right in the middle here where there 's a sweet spot 
 the noise is dominated by human ships  now think about it this is an amazing thing that in this frequency range where whales communicate  the main source globally on our planet for the noise comes from human ships  thousands of human ships distant
  far away  just all aggregating  
 the next slide will show what the impact this may have on the range at which whales can communicate  so here we have the loudness of a call at the whale and as we get farther away  the sound gets fainter and fainter  
 now
 in the pre industrial ocean as we were mentioning this whale call could be easily
  it 's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers 
 let 's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping 
 all of a sudden the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to ten kilometers now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they 're dispersed 
  imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations 
  have contact calls like i described for the dolphins i 'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales
 to stay in touch  and this is the kind of call that is used by say right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again  
 now imagine let 's put the ship noise in the in the picture what 's a mother to do if the ship comes by and her calf isn 't there i 'll describe a couple strategies 
 one strategy is if your call 's down here
  and the noise is in this band you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better  
 susan parks of penn state has actually studied this she 's looked in the atlantic here 's data from the south atlantic here 's a typical south atlantic contact call from the ' 70s look what happened by two thousand to the average call 
 same thing in the north atlantic in the ' 50s versus two thousand 
 over the last fifty years as we 've put more noise into the oceans these whales have had to shift it 's as if the whole population
 had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor it
 's an amazing shift  induced by humans over this large scale in both time and space  
 and we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder like i did when that ship was playing by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band 
  now there 's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be 
 probably lost opportunities if we also have to wait for silence they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate  so we have to be very concerned
 about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate or are not able to perform critical functions it 's a really important problem  
  and i 'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area looking at the impact of shipping on whales 
 in terms of the shipping noise the international maritime organization of the united nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships to tell the industry how you could quiet ships  
 and they 've already found that by by being more intelligent about better propeller
  you can reduce that noise by ninety percent  if you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull you can reduce that noise by ninety nine percent  
 so at this point it 's primarily an issue of cost and standards  if this group can establish standards and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships we can now see a gradual decline in this potential problem  
 but there 's also another problem from ships that i 'm illustrating here  and that 's the problem of collision  this is a whale that just squeaked
  by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision  but collision is a serious problem endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision  and it 's very important to try to reduce this i
 'll discuss two very promising approaches  
 the first case comes from the bay of fundy these black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the bay
  the colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane it turns out that this lane here
 goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision  well biologists
 who couldn 't take no for an answer went to the international maritime organization and petitioned them to say can
  those are just lines on the ground can 't you move them over to a place where there 's less of a risk and the international maritime organization responded very strongly these are the new lanes the shipping 
  lanes have been moved  and as you can see the risk of collision is much lower  so it 's very promising actually we can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks 
  gas emissions with global warming the maersk line
 looked at their competition and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money  they rush as fast as they can to get to their port  but then they often wait there
 what maersk did is they worked ways to slow down they could slow down by about fifty percent  this reduced their fuel consumption by about thirty percent
 which saved them money  
 and at the same time  it had a significant benefit for whales it you slow down you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision  
 so to conclude i 'd just like to point out you know the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment they 've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this  
 and we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities
  same time we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems  i hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected 
  areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate thank you very much
