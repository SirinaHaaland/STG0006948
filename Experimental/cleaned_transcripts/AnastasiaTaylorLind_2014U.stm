  when i arrived in kiev on february one this year  independence square was under siege  surrounded by police loyal to the government 
 the protesters who occupied maidan  as the square is known prepared for battle
  stockpiling homemade weapons
 and mass producing improvised body armor 
 the euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of two thousand and thirteen after the president of ukraine  viktor yanukovych 
 rejected a far reaching accord with the european union in favor of stronger ties with russia 
 in response tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central
  kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance 
 as the months passed confrontations between police and civilians intensified  
 i set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on  hrushevsky street  there i photographed the fighters against a black
  a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop
 of fire  ice and smoke 
 in order to tell the individual human stories here  
 i felt that i needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media  
 what i was witnessing was not only news  but also history with this realization  i was free from the
  newspaper and the magazine  oleg vasiliy and maxim
 were all ordinary men with ordinary lives from ordinary towns  
 but the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary  
 i say the word costume because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone 
 they were improvised uniforms made up
  of decommissioned military equipment  irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police 
 i became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves this
 outward expression of masculinity the ideal of the warrior  
 i worked slowly  using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter
 the process is  old fashioned it gives me time to speak with each person
 and to look at them in silence  while they look back at me 
 rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on february twenty 
 which became known as bloody thursday  
 snipers loyal to the government started firing on the civilians and
  protesters on institutskaya street  many were killed in a very short space of time 
 the reception of the hotel ukraine became a makeshift morgue there were lines of bodies laid in the street  
 and there was blood all over the pavements 
 the following day president yanukovych fled ukraine in all three months of protests resulted in more than
  one hundred and twenty confirmed dead
 and many more missing 
 history unfolded quickly  but celebration remained elusive in maidan  
 as the days passed in kiev 's central square streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people filling the streets in an act of collective mourning 
 many were women who often carried flowers that they had
  brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead  they came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers  
 sadness enveloped maidan  it was quiet and i could hear the birds singing  i hadn 't heard that before  
 i stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture 
 most women
  cried when i photographed them on the first day my fixer emine and i cried with almost every woman who visited our studio  
 there had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point and the color of their pastel coats 
 their shiny handbags and the bunches of red carnations
  white tulips and yellow roses that they carried
 jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there  
 it is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don 't make much sense without the other 
 they are about men and women and the way we are not the way we look but the way we are 
 they speak about different gender roles in conflict not only in maidan  and not only in ukraine 
 men fight most wars
  mourn them  if the men showed the ideal of the warrior  then the women showed the implications of such violence
