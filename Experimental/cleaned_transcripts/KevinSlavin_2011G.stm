  this is a photograph by the artist michael najjar and it 's real
 in the sense that he went there to argentina to take the photo  but it 's also a fiction there 's a lot of work that went into it after that and what he 's done is he 's actually
 reshaped  digitally all of the
 contours of the mountains to follow the vicissitudes of the dow jones index  so what you see that precipice that high precipice with the valley is the two thousand and eight financial 
  crisis the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there i don 't know where we are now
  art this is metaphor  but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth  and it 's with those teeth that i want to propose today that 
  we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math not just financial math but math in general that its transition from being something that we
  extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it
 the world around us and the world inside us and it 's specifically algorithms which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff 
 they acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again and they ossify and calcify and they become
 real  
 i was thinking about this 
 of all places on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago because i happened to be seated next to a hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about
 what life was like during the cold war for physicists in hungary  and i said so what were you doing and he said well we were
 mostly breaking stealth and i said that 's a good job  that 's interesting  how does that work and to understand that you have to understand a little bit
 about how stealth works and so
 an over simplification but basically 
 it 's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through one hundred and fifty six tons of steel in the sky it 's not just going to disappear  
 but if you can take this big massive thing  and you could
 turn it into
 a million little things something like a flock of birds well then the radar that 's looking for that has to be able to see
  every flock of birds in the sky  and if you 're a radar that 's a really bad job  
 and he said yeah he said but that 's if you 're a radar so we didn 't use a radar we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals electronic communication  
 and whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic
  that 's good so you 've effectively negated sixty years of aeronautic research what 's your act two  what do you do when you grow up and he said
  one of them and i said   what 's the black box for wall street and he said it 's funny you ask that because it 's actually called black box trading  
 and it 's also sometimes called algo trading algorithmic trading 
 and algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the united states air force had 
 which is that they 're moving these positions whether
  it 's proctor & gamble or accenture whatever they 're moving a million shares of something through the market  
 and if they do that all at once it 's like playing poker and going all in right away you just tip your hand  
 and so they have to find a way and they use algorithms to do this to break up that big thing into a million little transactions  and the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you
  use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what 's actually happening in the market so if you need to 
  have some image of what 's happening in the stock market right now what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide 
  and that 's seventy percent of the united states stock market seventy percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension
 your mortgage  and what could go wrong 
 what could go wrong is that a year ago  nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes and they called it the flash crash of two
  a sudden nine percent just goes away and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it nobody asked for it nobody had any control over what was actually happening all they had
 was just a monitor in front of them
 that had the numbers on it and just a red button that
  and that 's the thing is that we 're writing things we 're writing these things that we can no longer read 
 and we 've we 've rendered something illegible  
 and
 we 've lost the sense of what 's actually happening in this world that we 've made  and we 're starting to make our way there 's a company in boston called nanex 
  and they use math and magic and i don 't know what and they reach
  into all the market data and they find actually sometimes some of these algorithms and when they find them they they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies  
 and they do what we 've always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don 't understand which is that they give them a name and a story so this is one that they
  they called the knife 
 the carnival the boston shuffler  twilight  
 and the gag is that of course  
 these aren 't just running through the market you can find these kinds of things wherever you look once you learn how to look for them 
 you can find it here this book about flies that you may have been looking at on amazon you may have noticed it when
  its price started at one point seven million dollars  it 's out of print
 still 
 if you had bought it at one point seven it would have been a bargain a few hours later it had gone up to
 twenty three point six million dollars  plus shipping and handling  and the question is nobody was buying or selling anything what was happening and you see this behavior on amazon as surely as you see it on wall street  and when you see this kind of
  behavior what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict algorithms locked in loops with each other  without any human oversight  without any adult supervision to say actually one point seven million
 is plenty 
 and as with amazon so it is with netflix
  and so netflix
 has gone through several different algorithms over the years they started with cinematch and they they 've tried a bunch of others there 's dinosaur planet there 's gravity they 're using pragmatic chaos now pragmatic chaos
 is like all of netflix algorithms trying to do the same thing it 's trying to get a grasp on you on the firmware inside the human skull  so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next which is a very very
  but the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don 't really quite have it down 
 it doesn 't take away from the effects pragmatic chaos has pragmatic chaos like all netflix algorithms  determines in the end sixty percent
 of what movies end up being rented  so one piece of code with one idea about you
 is responsible for sixty percent of those movies but what if you could rate those movies
 before they get made 
 wouldn 't that be handy well a few data scientists from the u k are in hollywood and they have story algorithms a company called epagogix and you can run your script 
 through there  and they can tell you quantifiably that that 's a thirty million dollar movie or a two hundred million dollar movie and the thing is is that this isn 't google this isn 't information these
 culture  and what you see here or what you don 't really see normally is that these are the physics of culture  
 and if these algorithms like the algorithms on wall street just crashed one day and went awry  how would we know 
 what would it look like  
 and they 're in your
  they 're in your house these are two algorithms competing for your living room these are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means and you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them 
 and they 're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom
  and the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not
  a sealed metal box a new style elevator they 're called 
  elevators these are the ones where you have to press what floor you 're going to go to before you get in the elevator  and it uses what 's called a bin packing algorithm  so none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want 
 everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two and everybody who wants to go to the third floor
  into car five and the problem with that is that people
 freak out 
 people panic  and you see why you see why  it 's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation like the buttons 
 like the things that people use all it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that
  and this is what we 're designing for we 're designing for this machine dialect
  and how far can you take that how far can you take it you can take it really really far so let me take it back to wall street
  because the algorithms of wall street
 are dependent on one quality above all else which is speed  
 and they operate on milliseconds and microseconds and just to give you a sense of what microseconds are it takes you
  you five hundred thousand microseconds just to click a mouse  but if you 're a wall street algorithm and you 're five microseconds behind you 're a loser
 so if you were an algorithm you 'd look for an architect like the one that i met in frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper throwing out all the furniture all the infrastructure for human use and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in
  all so an algorithm could get close to the internet 
 and you think of the internet as this kind of distributed system and of course it is but it 's distributed from places in new york this is where it 's distributed from the carrier hotel
 located on hudson street  and this is really where the wires come right up into the
  reality is that the further away you are from that you 're a few microseconds behind every time 
 these guys down on wall street marco polo and cherokee nation  they 're eight microseconds behind
 all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out
 up around the carrier hotel
  and that 's going to keep happening we 're going to keep hollowing them out because you inch for inch and pound for pound
  and dollar for dollar none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space like the boston shuffler could 
 but if you zoom out if you zoom out you would see 
 trench
 between new york city and chicago that 's been built over the last few years by a company called spread networks this is a fiber optic cable that was laid between
  those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal thirty seven times faster than you can click a mouse
 just for these algorithms just for the carnival and the knife  
 and when you think about this that we 're running through the united states with dynamite and rock saws
 so that an algorithm can close the deal three microseconds faster
 all for a communications framework that no human will ever know  
 that 's a kind of manifest destiny and we 'll always look for a new frontier  
 unfortunately we have our work cut out for us 
 this is just theoretical this is
 some mathematicians at mit  and the truth is i don 't really understand a lot of what they 're talking about it involves light
  cones and quantum entanglement  and i don 't really understand any of that but i can read this map  
 and what this map says is that if you 're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are that 's where people are where the cities are you 're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are 
 to do that most effectively  and the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean  
  build bubbles or something or platforms we 'll actually part the water
 to pull money out of the air because it 's a bright future if you 're an algorithm 
 and it 's not the money that 's so interesting actually it 's what the money motivates
  that we 're actually terraforming the earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency
  and in that light you go back and you look at michael najjar 's photographs  and you realize that they 're not metaphor  they 're prophecy 
 they 're prophecy for the kind of seismic  
 terrestrial effects of the math that we 're making  and the landscape was always made by this sort
  uneasy collaboration between nature and man  
 but now there 's this third co evolutionary force algorithms the boston shuffler the carnival 
 and we will have to understand those as nature and in a way  they are
