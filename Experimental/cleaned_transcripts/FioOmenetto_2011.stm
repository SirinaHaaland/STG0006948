  thrilled to be here i 'm going to talk about a new old material that still continues to amaze us  and that might impact the way we think about material
  high technology and maybe along the way also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation so that 's kind of a bold statement i 'll tell you a little bit more this material actually has some traits 
  that make it seem almost too good to be true  it 's sustainable it 's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature
  it 's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response it actually gets reintegrated in the body and it 's technological so it can do things like
 microelectronics and maybe photonics do and the material
 looks something like this 
 in fact this material you see is clear and transparent the components of this material are just water and protein  so this material is is silk
  so it 's kind of different from what we 're used to thinking about silk  so the question is how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia 
 the process of discovery generally is inspired by nature  and so we marvel at silk worms the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber
 the silk worm does a remarkable thing it uses these two ingredients protein and water that are in its gland to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection so comparable to to technical fibers like
  and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about and that we 're familiar with for the textile industry the textile industry goes
 and unwinds the cocoon
 and then weaves glamorous things we want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid kevlar to this natural kevlar so the insight
  is how do you actually reverse engineer this
 and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material and this is an insight that came about two decades ago 
 from a person that i 'm very
 very
 fortunate to work with david kaplan  and so we get this starting material  and so this starting material is back to the basic building block and then we use this
  to do a variety of things like for example this film and we take advantage of something that is very simple the recipe to make those films is
 is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do they find their way to self assemble so the recipe is simple you take the silk solution you pour it 
 and you wait for the protein to self assemble 
 and then you detach the protein and you get this film as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates  but i mentioned that the film is also technological and so what does that mean it means that
 you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology like microelectronics and nanoscale technology and the image of the dvd here is just to illustrate a point that that silk
 silk follows very very subtle topographies of the surface which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale so it would be able to replicate the information
 that is on the dvd  
 and we can store information
  and protein so we tried something out and we wrote a message in a piece of silk which is right here and the message is over there and much like in the dvd you can read it out optically  
 and this requires a stable hand so this is why i decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people
 so let me see so as you see the film go in transparently through there and then
  and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that 
 so once you have
 these these attributes of this material then you can do a lot of things it 's actually not limited to films  and so the material can assume
 a lot of formats
  crazy and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes or you can do beautiful things that if the camera can capture you can make
 you can add a third dimensionality to
 to the film and if the angle is right you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk  
 but you can do other things you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light
  we 've made optical fibers but silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics  and you can think of different formats so for instance if you 're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle we do microneedle 
  arrays what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that 's made of silk just to give you a sense of size  
  the gears work in water as well so you think of of alternative mechanical parts and maybe you can use that liquid kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins for example  
  or maybe an entire bone  and so you have here a little example of a small skull what we
  you can do things like cups for example  and so if you add a little bit of gold if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods you can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap 
 or
 if you 're fashion forward some silk led tattoos so there 's versatility  as you see in the material formats 
 that you can do with silk but there are still some unique traits i mean why would you want to do all these things
 i mentioned it briefly at the beginning the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible and you see here a picture of a tissue section  
 and so what does that mean that it 's biodegradable and biocompatible you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted which means that all the devices that you 've seen before and all the formats in principle 
 can be implanted and disappear and what you see there in that tissue section in fact is you see that reflector tape
  much like you 're seen at night
 by a car then the idea is that you can see if you illuminate tissue you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk and you see there it gets reintegrated in tissue and reintegration in the human body is not the only thing
  but reintegration in the environment is important so you have a
  you have protein and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt
 unlike the polystyrene cups
 that that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday  it 's edible  so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food
  it doesn 't taste good so
 i 'm going to need some help with that 
 but probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle silk  during its self assembly process  acts like a cocoon for biological matter and so if you change the recipe and you add things
 when you pour so you add things to your liquid silk solution
 where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines 
 the self assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants  so it makes the materials environmentally
  active and interactive  so that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to
 screw a bone together a fractured bone together and deliver drugs at the same  while your bone is healing for example 
 or you could put drugs in your wallet
 and not in your fridge so we 've made a silk card with penicillin in it and we stored penicillin at sixty degrees c so one hundred and
  forty degrees fahrenheit for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin  and so that could be 
 that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels 
 and of course there 's no use in storage if you can 't use [ it ] and so there is this
  that these materials have that they 're programmably degradable
 and so what you see there is the difference in the top you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade and in the bottom a film that has been programmed to degrade in water and what you see is that the film on the bottom releases
 what is inside it so it allows for the recovery of what we 've stored before and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for
 for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you 've seen so the thread of discovery that we
  have really is a thread  we 're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do whether you want to
 replace a vein or a bone or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics 
 perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt maybe carry your drugs in your pocket deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert the answer
  may be in a thread of silk thank you
