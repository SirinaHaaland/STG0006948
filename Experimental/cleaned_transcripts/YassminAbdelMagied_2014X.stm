  someone who looks like me walks past you in the street do you think they 're a mother a refugee
 or a victim of oppression or do you think they 're a cardiologist a barrister or maybe your local politician
  do you look me up and down wondering how hot i must get or if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit 
 what if i wore my scarf like this 
 i can walk down the street in the exact same outfit and what the world expects of me and the way i 'm treated depends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth 
 but this isn 't going to be another monologue
  about the hijab because lord knows muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth they choose or not to wrap their head in 
 this is about looking beyond your bias 
 what if i walked past you and later on you 'd found out that actually
 i was a race car engineer  and that i designed my own race car and i ran my university 's race team because it 's true  what if i told you
  you that i was actually trained as a boxer for five years because that 's true too would it surprise you 
 why 
 ladies and gentlemen  ultimately that surprise and the behaviors associated with it are the product of something called unconscious bias  or implicit prejudice  and that results in the ridiculously detrimental lack of diversity in our workforce
  particularly in areas of influence  hello australian federal cabinet let me just set something out from the
 unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination i 'm not saying that in all of you there 's a secret sexist or racist or ageist lurking within waiting to get out 
  that 's not what i 'm saying  we all have our biases they 're the filters through which we see the world around us 
 i 'm not accusing anyone bias is not an accusation rather  it 's something that has to be identified acknowledged and mitigated against 
 bias can be about race it can be about gender  it can also be about class education 
 disability the fact is we all have biases against what 's different  what 's different to our social norms  
 the thing is if we want
  to live in a world where the circumstances of your birth do not dictate your future
 and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous then each and every one of us has a role to play in making sure unconscious bias does not determine our lives  
 there 's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious
  back in the day were made up mostly of dudes up to only five percent were female  and apparently that was because men played it differently  presumably better  
 presumably but in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two the boston symphony orchestra started an experiment they started blind auditions  so rather than
  you would have to play behind a screen now funnily enough  no immediate change was registered until they asked the audition ers to take their shoes off before they entered the room 
 of the heels against the hardwood floors was enough to give the ladies away  now get this there results of the audition showed
 that there was a fifty percent increased chance a woman would progress past the preliminary stage and it almost tripled their chances of getting
 what does that tell us  well  unfortunately for the guys men actually didn 't play differently  but there was the perception that they did 
 and it was that bias that was determining their outcome 
 so what we 're doing here is identifying and acknowledging that a bias exists  and look we all do it  let me give you an
  a son and his father are in a horrible car accident  the father dies on impact
 and the son who 's severely injured is rushed to hospital  the surgeon looks at the son when they arrive
 and is like i can 't operate why the boy is my son 
 how can that be ladies and gentlemen  the surgeon is his mother
  now hands up and it 's okay but hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy  
 there 's evidence that that unconscious bias exists but we all just have to acknowledge that it 's there and then look at ways that we can move past it so that we can look at solutions  
 now
 one of the interesting things around the space of unconscious bias is the topic of
  and this something that 's often brought up and of of the criticisms is this idea of merit 
 look i don 't want to be picked because i 'm a chick i want to be picked because i have merit because i 'm the best person for the job  
 it 's a sentiment that 's pretty common among female engineers that i work with and that i know and yeah i get it i 've been there 
 but if the merit idea was true why would identical resumes in an experiment done in two thousand and twelve by yale identical resumes sent out for
  lab technician why would jennifers be deemed less competent be less likely to be offered the job  and be paid less
 than johns  
 the unconscious bias is there  but we just have to look at how we can move past it and you know it 's interesting  there 's some research that talks about why this is the case and it 's called the merit paradox 
 and in organizations and this is kind of ironic in
  organizations that talk about merit being their primary  value driver in terms of who they hire they were more likely to hire dudes and more likely to pay the guys more because apparently merit is a masculine quality  
 so you guys think you 've got a good read on me you kinda think you know what 's up 
 can you imagine me running
  ladies and gentlemen that 's my day job  and the cool thing about it is that it 's pretty entertaining actually in places like malaysia
  muslim women on rigs isn 't even  comment worthy there are that many of them but it is entertaining i remember i was telling one of the guys hey mate look i really want to learn how to surf 
 and he 's like yassmin i don 't know how you can surf with all that gear you 've got on 
 and i don 't know any 
 and then the guy came up with a brilliant idea he was like i know you run that organization youth without borders right  why don 't you start
  a clothing line for muslim chicks in beaches you can call it youth without boardshorts 
 and i was like thanks guys 
 and i remember another bloke telling me that i should eat all the yogurt i could because that was the only culture i was going to get around there
 but the problem is it 's kind of true
 because there 's an intense lack of diversity in
  our workforce particularly in places of influence now in two thousand and ten the australian national university did an experiment where they sent out four thousand identical applications
 to entry level jobs essentially 
 to get the same number of interviews as someone with an anglo saxon name if you were chinese you had to send out
  and if you 're italian you 're pretty lucky you only have to send out twelve percent more 
 in places like silicon valley it 's not that much better  in google they put out some diversity results and
 sixty one percent white  thirty percent asian and nine a bunch of
 blacks hispanics all that kind of thing
  the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they 've acknowledged it but i 'm not really sure what they 're doing about it the thing is it doesn 't trickle up 
 in a study done by green park who are a british
 senior exec supplier they said that over half of the ftse one hundred companies don 't have a nonwhite leader
 at their board level executive or non executive and two out of every three
 don 't have an executive who 's from
 and most of the minorities that are at that sort of level are non executive board directors so their influence isn 't that great
 i 've told you a bunch of terrible things you 're like oh my god how bad is that what can i do about it 
 well  fortunately  we 've identified that there 's a problem there 's a lack of opportunity
  and that 's due to unconscious bias  but you might be sitting there thinking i ain 't brown what 's that got to do with me 
 let me offer you a solution  and as as i 've said before  we live in a world where
 we 're looking for an ideal and if we want to create a world where the circumstances of your birth don 't matter we all have to be part of the solution and interestingly the author of the lab resume experiment offered some sort of a solution she said the one thing that
  brought the the successful women together the one thing that they had in common was the fact that they had good mentors  so mentoring we 've all kind of heard that before it
 's in the vernacular 
 here 's another challenge for you i challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different 
  everyone wants to mentor someone who kind of is familiar who looks like us we have shared experiences if i see a muslim chick who 's got a bit of attitude i 'm like what 's up we can hang out 
 you walk into a room and there 's someone who went to the same school you play the same sports there 's a high chance that you 're going to want to help that person out  
 but for the person in the room who has no shared experiences with you
 it becomes extremely difficult to find that connection
  the idea of finding someone different to mentor someone who doesn 't come from the same background as you whatever that background is is about opening doors for people who couldn 't even get to the damn hallway  
 because ladies and gentlemen the world is not just 
 people are not born with equal opportunity  i was born in one of the poorest cities in the world khartoum i was born brown i was born female and i was born muslim
  pretty suspicious of us for reasons i can 't control  
 however  i also acknowledge the fact that i was born with privilege 
 i was born with amazing parents i was given an education and had the blessing of migrating to australia  but also i 've been blessed with amazing mentors who 've opened doors for me that i didn 't even know were there 
 a mentor who said to me hey your story 's interesting  let
  write something about it so that i can share it with people a mentor who said i know you 're all those things that don 't belong on an australian rig but come on anyway 
 and here i am talking to you and i 'm not the only one there 's all sorts of people in my communities that i see have been helped out by mentors a young muslim man in sydney who ended up
 using his mentor 's help to start up
 a poetry slam in  bankstown and now it 's a huge thing and he 's able to change the lives of so many other young people or a lady here in
  brisbane an afghan lady who 's a refugee who could barely speak english when she came to australia  her mentors helped her become a doctor and she took our young queenslander of the year award in two thousand and eight  she 's an inspiration
  the woman in the rig clothes  and i 'm also the woman who was in the abaya at the beginning 
 would you have chosen to mentor me if you had seen me in one of those other versions of who i am  because i 'm that same person 
 we have to look past our unconscious bias  find someone to mentor who 's at the opposite end of your spectrum because structural change takes time  
 and i don 't have that level of patience
 so if we 're going to create a change if we 're going to create a world where we all have those kinds of opportunities  then choose to open doors for people because you might think that
 diversity has nothing to do with you  but we are all part of this system and we can all be part of that solution  and if you don 't know where to find someone different  go to the places you wouldn 't usually go 
 if you enroll in private high school tutoring go to your local state
  school or maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center  
 or perhaps you work at an office take out that new grad who looks totally out of place ' cause that was me and open doors for them not in a tokenistic way because we 're not victims  
 but show them the opportunities because opening up your world
 will make you realize that you have access to doors that they didn 't even know existed and you didn 't even know they didn 't have
  ladies and gentlemen  
 there is a problem in our community with lack of opportunity
 especially due to unconscious bias but each and every one one of you has the potential to change that i know you 've been given a lot of challenges today  
 but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently  
  and i encourage you to look past your initial perceptions because i bet you they 're probably wrong
