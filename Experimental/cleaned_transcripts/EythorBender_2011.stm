  you now to imagine
 a wearable robot
 that gives you superhuman abilities or another one that takes wheelchair users
 up standing and walking again
  we at berkeley bionics
 call these robots exoskeletons 
 these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning  and it will give you extra strength 
 and it will further enhance your speed  
 and it will help you for instance to manage your balance 
 it is actually the
  true integration
 of the man and the machine  
 but not only that it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there 
 this is just not some blue sky thinking to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldier that on average does carry about one hundred
 on their backs  and they are being asked to carry more equipment  obviously this is resulting
 in some major complications back injuries  thirty percent of them
 chronic back injuries  so we thought we would
 look at this challenge and create an
  over varied terrain for many hours its flexible design allows for deep squats  crawls and high agility
  it senses what i want to do  where i want to go  and then augments my strength and endurance eythor bender 
 we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this
 device this new exoskeleton this year  so this is for real now let 's turn our heads towards
 the wheelchair users something
  million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide  this is about one percent of the total population  and that 's actually a conservative estimate 
 we are talking here about oftentimes very young individuals with spinal cord injuries that in the prime of 
 hit a wall and the wheelchair 's the only option  but it is also the aging population that is multiplying in
  numbers and
 the only option pretty much
 when it 's stroke or other complications is the wheelchair and that is actually for the last five hundred years 
 since its very successful introduction i must say  
 so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter
 of mobility let me now
  introduce you to elegs
 that is worn by amanda boxtel
 that nineteen years ago was spinal cord injured  and as a result of that she has not been able to walk
 for nineteen years until now
  sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back 
 there are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips
  well as her knee joints that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait ab 
 i was twenty four years old and at the top of my game
 when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me in a
 split second i lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis 
 not long afterwards a doctor strode into my hospital room  and he said amanda you
 'll never walk again 
 and that was nineteen yeas ago 
 he robbed
 every ounce of hope from my being  adaptive technology has since
 enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again to rock climb and even handcycle  but nothing has been invented
 that enables me to walk until now
  we have the platforms
 to sit down and have discussions with you it
 's in our hands  and we have all the potential here to change the lives
 of future generations not only for the soldiers
  or for amanda here and all the wheelchair users  but for everyone
