  believe me or not i come offering a solution
 to a very important part of this larger problem with the requisite focus on climate and the solution i offer
 is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth
  by humankind 
 and the resulting decline of the biosphere that culprit is business and industry  
 which happens to be where i have spent the last fifty two years since my graduation from georgia tech in one thousand nine hundred and fifty six as an industrial engineer  cum aspiring and then successful
  years ago to produce carpet tiles in america
 for the business and institution markets 
 and shepherding it through start up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field  
 i read paul hawken 's book the ecology of commerce the summer of 
 in his book  paul charges business and industry as one the major
  culprit
 in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough  and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess  
 and by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth and i then challenged the people of interface my company
  our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability which we defined as eventually operating 
 company
 in such a way as to take from the earth
 only what can be renewed by the earth naturally and rapidly not another fresh drop of oil and to do no harm to the biosphere  
 take nothing do no harm i simply said if hawken is right and business and industry must lead who will lead business and industry unless somebody
  leads nobody will it 's axiomatic why not us  
 and thanks to the people of interface  
 i have become a recovering plunderer 
 i once told a fortune magazine writer
  that someday people like me would go to jail  
 and that became the headline of a fortune article they went on to describe me as america 's greenest ceo 
 from plunderer to recovering plunderer to america 's greenest ceo in five years
 that frankly was a pretty sad commentary on american ceos in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
 asked later in the canadian documentary the
  what i meant by the go to jail remark  i offered that theft is a crime  and theft of our children 's future
 would someday be a crime 
 but i realized for that to be true for theft of our children 's future to be a crime there must be a clear demonstrable alternative
 industrial system that so dominates our
  and is the major culprit stealing our children 's future by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator in short digging up the earth and converting it to pollution 
 according to paul and anne ehrlich
 and a well known environmental impact equation impact a bad thing is the product
  and technology that is impact is generated by people what they consume in their affluence and how it is produced 
 and though the equation is largely subjective you can perhaps quantify people and perhaps quantify affluence but technology is abusive in
 too many ways to quantify so the equation is conceptual  still it works to help us understand the problem so we set out at interface in
 to create an example to transform the way we made carpet
  petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy 
 and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact rather than multiplied it 
 paul and anne ehrlich 's environmental impact equation i is equal to p times a times t
  population affluence and technology i wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read
 i equals p times a divided by t now the 
  will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact a bad thing but t in the denominator decreases
  what would move t technology  
 from the numerator call it t1 where it increases impact to the denominator call it t2 where it reduces impact  
 i thought about the characteristics of
 first industrial revolution t1 as we practiced it at interface and it had the following
  taking raw materials from the earth  
 linear  take make waste powered by fossil fuel derived energy wasteful abusive and focused on labor productivity 
 more carpet per man hour 
 thinking it through i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the
  in the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable 
 linear by cyclical fossil fuel energy by renewable energy sunlight
  wasteful by waste free and abusive by benign and labor productivity by resource productivity  
 and i reasoned that if we could make
 those transformative changes and get rid of t1 altogether we could reduce our impact to zero
 including our impact on the climate  and that became the interface plan in 
  and has been the plan ever since we have
 measured our progress very rigorously 
 so i can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing twelve years net greenhouse gas emissions down eighty two
  over the same span of time sales have increased by two thirds and profits have doubled so an eighty two percent absolute reduction translates into a ninety percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales 
 this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire
  climate disruption so the scientists are telling us  
 fossil fuel usage is down sixty percent per unit of production due to efficiencies in renewables  the cheapest most secure barrel of oil there is is the one 
 not used through efficiencies water usage is down seventy five percent in our worldwide carpet tile business down forty percent in our broadloom carpet
  business which we acquired in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three right here in california city of industry  where water is so precious  
 renewable or recyclable materials are twenty five percent of the total and growing rapidly renewable energy is twenty seven percent of our total  
 going for one hundred percent we have diverted one hundred and forty eight million pounds that 's seventy four thousand tons of used carpet from landfills 
  loop on material flows through reverse logistics
 and post consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started fourteen years ago 
 those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold eighty five million square yards of climate neutral carpet
 since two thousand and four meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption
  producing the carpet throughout the supply chain from mine and well head
 clear to end of life reclamation independent  third party certified  we call it cool carpet 
 and it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator increasing sales and profits  three years ago
 we launched carpet tile for the home under the brand flor
 you can point and click today at flor com and have cool carpet delivered to your front door in five days it is practical and pretty too 
 we reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal zero impact zero footprint 
 as our target year for zero for reaching the top the summit of mount sustainability  
 we call this mission zero  
 and this is perhaps the most important facet we have found mission zero to be incredibly good for business a better business model  a better way to
  here is the business case for sustainability from real life experience costs are down not up  reflecting some four hundred million dollars of avoided costs 
  in pursuit of zero waste the first face of mount sustainability  
  for sustainability  an unexpected wellspring of innovation 
 our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose you cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together  
 and the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing no amount of advertising no clever marketing campaign 
 at any price could have produced or created this much goodwill
 costs products people marketplaces
 what else is there it is a better business model  and here is our 14 year record of sales
 and profits there is a dip there from two thousand and one to two thousand and three a dip when our sales over a three year period were down seventeen percent but the marketplace
  we literally gained market share we might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability  
 if every business were pursuing interface plans 
 would that solve all our problems  i don 't think so i remain troubled by the revised ehrlich equation  i equals p times a divided by t2 
 that a is a capital a  suggesting that affluence is an end in
  itself  but what if we reframed ehrlich further  
 and what if we made a a lowercase ' a ' suggesting that it is a means to an end and that end is happiness
 more happiness with less stuff you know that would reframe civilization
  our whole system of economics  if not for our species 
 then perhaps for the one that succeeds us  the sustainable species living on a finite earth  ethically happily and ecologically in 
  balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations or ten thousand generations
  that is to say into the indefinite future  but
 does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species  well maybe so but i don 't think so at interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable 
  industrial company fully into existence by two thousand and twenty we can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain and now the challenge
  is in execution  and as my good friend and adviser amory lovins says if something exists it must be possible 
 if we can actually do it it must be possible if we 
 company can do it anybody can and if anybody can
  it follows that everybody can hawken fulfilled business and industry leading humankind away from the abyss
 because 
 with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere a very dear person is at risk here frankly an unacceptable risk who is that person 
 not you not i but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here and i myself met this person in the early days
  of this mountain climb on a tuesday morning in march of 
  i was talking to people as i did at every opportunity back then bringing them along and often not knowing whether i was connecting but
 about five days later back in atlanta i received an email from glenn thomas one of my people in the california meeting
  he was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our tuesday morning together and when i read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life 
 because it told me by god one person got it here
 is what glenn wrote and here is that person most at risk please meet tomorrow 's child 
 without a name an unseen face and knowing not your time or place
  tomorrow 's child though yet unborn  i met you first last tuesday morn 
 a wise friend introduced us two and through his sobering point of view i saw a day that you would see a day for you but not for me 
 knowing you has changed my thinking for i never had an inkling that perhaps the things i do might someday somehow threaten you 
 tomorrow 's child my daughter son i 'm afraid i 've just begun to think of you and of your good
  though always having known i should  
 begin i will the way the cost of what i squander what is lost if ever i forget that you will someday come
 and live here too well every day of my life since tomorrow 's child has spoken to me with one simple but profound
  which i presume to share with you we are each and every one a part of the web of life 
 the continuum of humanity sure but in a larger sense the web of life itself and we have a choice to make
 during our brief brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet to hurt it
 or to help it for you it 's your call
