  the school of architecture that i studied at some thirty years ago happened to be across the street
 from the wonderful art gallery designed by the great architect
 louis kahn i love the building and i used to visit it quite often one day
 i saw the security guard
 run his hand across the concrete wall  and it was the way he did it the expression on his face
 something touched me i could see that the security guard was moved by the building
 and that architecture has that capacity to move you
  i could see it and i remember thinking wow 
 how does architecture do that at school i was learning to design but here
 here was a reaction of the heart  and it touched me to the core
  aspire for beauty for 
 for atmosphere  the emotional response 
 that 's the realm of the ineffable and the immeasurable  and that 's what you live for 
 a chance to try  
 so in two thousand and three there was an open call for designs for the bah ' temple for south america
  this was
 the first temple in all of south america it 's a continental temple a hugely important milestone for the bah ' community because this would be the last
 of the continental temples
 and would open the door for national and local temples to be built around the world and the brief was deceptively simple
 and unique in the annals of religion
 a circular room  nine sides nine entrances nine paths  
 allowing you to come
 to the temple from all directions  nine symbolizing completeness perfection  
 no pulpit no sermons as there are no clergy in the
  and in a world which is putting up walls  the design needed to express in form
 the very opposite  it had to be open welcoming
 to people of all faiths walks of life  backgrounds or no faith no faith at
  a new form of sacred space with no pattern
 or
 models to draw from 
 it was like designing one of the first churches for christianity or one of the first mosques for islam so
 we live
 in a secular world 
 how do you design sacred space today
  and how do you even define what 's sacred today  
 i stumbled across
 this beautiful quote from the bah  ' writings  and it speaks to prayer  
 it says that if you reach out in prayer  and if your prayer is answered which is already very interesting
 that the pillars of your heart
  heart will become ashine 
 and i loved this idea of the inner and the outer 
 like when you see someone and you say that person is radiant 
 and i was thinking my gosh how could we make something architectural out of
  you create a building
 and it becomes alive with light  
 like alabaster if you kiss it with light it becomes alive  and i drew this sketch something with two layers  translucent
 with structure in between capturing light  maybe a pure form
  a single form of emanation that you could imagine would be all dome
 and everything we kept making was looking too much like an egg 
 laughter a blob 
 so you search you all know this crazy search letting the process take you 
 and you live for the surprises and i remember quite by accident i
 saw this little video
 of a plant
  moving
 in light  
 and it made me think of movement 
 reach this idea that the temple could have reach like this reach for the divine 
 you can imagine also that movement within a circle could mean movement and stillness like the cosmos 
 something you see in many places
 but
 rotation was not enough  because we needed a form in the bah  ' writings it talks about the temples being
 as perfect
 as is humanly possible  and we kept thinking well what is perfection  and i remember i stumbled into this
 image of this japanese basket and thinking our western notions of
  perfection need to be challenged that this this wonderful silhouette of this basket this wonkiness 
 and that it has the kind of dimple of of what you might imagine a shoulder
 or the cheekbone and that kind of organic form  
 and so we drew and made models these lines that merge at the top soft lines
  which became like drapery
 and translucent veils and folding 
 and the idea of not only folding but torquing you remember the plant and the way it was reaching  
 and this started to become an interesting form  carving the base making the
  then we ended up with this this is this temple with two layers  
 nine luminous veils embodied light soft flowing lines
 like luminescent drapery one hundred and eighty submissions were received from eighty countries  and
 this was selected so
 we
 went to the next stage of how to build it we had submitted
  alabaster  but alabaster was too soft  and we were experimenting many experiments with materials trying to think how we could
 have this kind of shimmer  and we ended up with
  the right temperature we ended up with this new material this new cast glass which took us about two years
 to make  
 and it had this quality that we loved this idea of the embodied light  
 but on the inside 
 we wanted something with a soft light  like the inner lining of a jacket on the outside you have protection but on the inside you touch it
 so we found this tiny vein in a huge quarry in portugal with this beautiful
 stone which the owner had kept
 for seven generations in his family  waiting for the right project if you can believe it  look
  's beautiful and the way it lights up it has that translucent quality 
 so here you see the structure it lets the light through  and
 looking down  the nine wings are bound structurally but symbolically strong  
 a great symbol
 of unity pure
  perfect circle thirty meters in section
 and in plan perfectly symmetrical like the idea of sacredness and geometry  and here you see
 the building going up two thousand steel nodes  nine thousand
 pieces of steel 
 seven thousand eight hundred stone pieces ten thousand cast glass pieces all individual shapes  the entire
  superstructure all described  engineered fabricated with aerospace technology prefabricated
 machine to machine robotically  a huge team effort you can imagine of literally hundreds  and within
 three percent
 of our $ thirty million budget set in two thousand and six
 nine wings
 bound together forming a  nine pointed star and the star shape moving
 in space tracking the sun
  a befitting response to that beautiful quote a prayer answered open in all directions
 capturing the blue light of dawn tent like white
 light of day  the gold light of the afternoon and of course at night  the reversal  
 sensuous catching the light in all kinds of mysterious ways  and the site
 it 's interesting fourteen years ago when we made the submission we showed the temple set against the andes we didn 't have the andes
 as our site but after nine years that 's exactly where we ended up 
 the lines of the temple set against nothing but pure nature and you turn around and you get nothing but the city
 below you and inside
  a view in all directions  radiating gardens
 from each of the alcoves  
 radiating paths  
 last october  the opening ceremonies a beautiful sacred event
  thousand people from eighty countries  a continuous river
 of visitors  indigenous people
 from all over south america some who had never left their villages  
 and of course that this temple belongs to people the collective of many cultures
 and walks of life many beliefs
 and for me what 's most important is what it feels like on the inside that it feel
 intimate sacred and that everyone is welcome  and if
 even a few who come
 have the same reaction as that security
  then it truly would be their temple  and i would love that thank you
