  a young man delivered a report to the united states congress
 that eighty years on  still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today
  the lives of everyone
 on this planet 
 that young man wasn 't a politician 
 he wasn 't a businessman a civil rights activist or a faith leader he was that most unlikely of heroes 
 an economist  
 his name was
  you might think this is a rather dry and dull report  and you 're absolutely right it 's dry as a bone  
 but this report is the foundation of how today we judge the success of countries  
 what we know best as gross domestic product 
 gdp 
 gdp
  has defined and shaped our lives for the last eighty years
  and today i want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries 
 a different way to define and shape our lives for the next eighty years  
 but first we have to understand how gdp came to dominate our lives kuznets ' report was delivered
  a moment of crisis the u s economy was plummeting into the great depression
 and policy makers were struggling to respond struggling because they didn 't know what was going on they didn 't have data and statistics  
 so what kuznet 's report gave them was
 reliable data on what the u s economy was producing  updated year by year
 and armed with this information policy makers were eventually  able to find a way out of the slump  
 and because kuznets  ' invention was found to be so useful it spread around the world and now today every country produces gdp statistics 
 but in that first report kuznets himself
 delivered a warning
 it 's in the introductory chapter on page seven he says the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of 
  national income as defined above it 's not the greatest sound bite in the world
 economic performance  it 's not a measure of our well being and it shouldn 't be a guide to all decision making 
 but we have ignored kuznets ' warning we live in a world where gdp is the benchmark of success
 in a global economy our politicians boast when gdp goes up markets move and trillions of dollars of
  capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries are going down all measured in gdp  
 our societies have become engines to create more gdp 
 but we know that gdp is flawed 
 it ignores the environment  it counts bombs and prisons as progress it can 't count
  happiness or community  and it has nothing to say about fairness or justice 
 is it any surprise that our world  marching to the drumbeat of gdp is teetering on the brink of environmental disaster and filled with anger and conflict  
 we need a better way to measure our societies a measure based on the
  real things that matter to real people do i have enough to eat can i read and write  
 am i safe 
 do i have rights  
 do i live in a society where i 'm not discriminated against is my future and the future of my children prevented from environmental
  these are questions that gdp does not and cannot answer  
 there have of course been efforts in the past to move beyond gdp 
 but i believe that we 're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution 
 we 're ready because we 've seen in the financial crisis of two thousand and eight how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray
  we 've seen in the arab spring how countries like tunisia were supposedly economic superstars  but they were societies that were seething with discontentment  
 we 're ready because today we have the technology
 to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to
  i 'd like to introduce you to the social progress index  
 it 's a measure of the well being of society completely separate from gdp  it 's a whole new way of looking at the world 
 the social progress index begins by defining what it means to be a good society
 based around three dimensions  the first is does everyone have the basic needs for survival food
 secondly does everyone have access to the building blocks to improve their lives  education information health and sustainable environment 
  and then third does every individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from
  do they have rights  freedom of choice  freedom from discrimination and access to the the world 's most advanced knowledge 
 together these twelve components form the social progress framework  
 and for each of these twelve components we have indicators to measure how countries are performing 
 not indicators of effort or intention but real achievement
  we don 't measure how much a country spends on healthcare  we measure the length and quality of people 's lives  
 we don 't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination  we measure whether people experience discrimination  
 but what you want to know is who 's top don 't you 
 laughter i knew that i knew that i knew that okay
  is put on the vertical axis social progress  higher is better 
 and then just for comparison just for fun on the horizontal axis is gdp per capita
  further to the right is more  so
 the country in the world with the highest social progress 
  the country with the least social progress  i 'm sorry to say is chad  i 've never been maybe next year 
  new zealand has a higher gdp than chad 
 it 's a good point  well made 
 but let me show you two other countries 
 here 's the united states considerably richer than new zealand  but with a lower level of social progress  
 and then here 's senegal
 it 's got a higher level of social progress than chad  but the same
  level of gdp  
 so what 's going on well look let me bring in the rest of the countries of the world the one hundred and thirty two we 've been able to measure each one represented by a dot  there we go lots of dots 
 now obviously i can 't do all of them so a few highlights for you the highest ranked g7 country is canada 
  but who cares at least we beat the french 
 and then looking at the emerging economies top of the brics pleased to say
  china
 and then india  tucked away on on the right hand side you will see a dot of a country with a lot of gdp but not a huge amount of social progress
 that 's kuwait just above brazil is a social progress superpower
 that 's costa rica it 's got a level of social progress the same as some western european countries with a much lower gdp  now  my slide is getting a
  little cluttered and i 'd like to step back a bit so let me take away these countries  and then pop in the regression line  so this shows the average relationship between gdp and social progress 
 the first thing to notice is that there 's lots of noise around the trend line
 and what this shows what this empirically demonstrates is that gdp is not destiny
  every level of gdp per capita  there are opportunities for more social progress  risks of less 
 the second thing to notice is that for poor countries  the curve is really steep  
 so what this tells us is that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra gdp and if they reinvest that in
  there 's a lot of social progress bang for your gdp buck  
 and that 's good news and that 's what we 've seen over the last twenty thirty years with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries  
 but go on a bit further up the curve  and then we see it flattening out each extra dollar of gdp is buying less and
  and with more and more of the world 's population living on this part of the curve it means gdp is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development
 of brazil here 's brazil 
 social progress of about seventy out of one hundred 
 gdp per capita about fourteen thousand dollars a year  and look  brazil 's above the line 
 brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning gdp into social progress
 but where does brazil go next 
 let 's say that brazil adopts a bold economic plan to double gdp in the next decade but that is only half a plan  
 it 's less than half a plan 
 because where does brazil want to go on social progress  
 brazil  it 's possible to
  increase your growth increase your gdp  while stagnating or going backwards on social progress  
 we don 't want brazil to become like russia  
 what you really want is for brazil to get ever more efficient at creating social progress from its gdp  so it becomes more like new zealand 
 and what that means is that brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it 's not just growth alone
  that 's what the social progress index does it reframes the debate about development not just about gdp alone  but inclusive sustainable growth that brings real improvements in people 's lives  
 and it 's not just about countries  earlier this year  with our
  here in brazil we launched the first subnational social progress index
  we did it for the amazon region
  it 's an area the size of europe twenty four million people one of the most deprived parts of the country 
 and here are the results  and this is broken down into nearly eight hundred different municipalities  
 and with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country
 imazon and other partners from government business and civil society
 can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people 's lives  while protecting that precious global asset that is the amazon rainforest  
 and this is just the beginning you can create a social progress
  we all know and love tedx this is social pogress x this is a tool for anyone to come and use  
 contrary to the way we sometimes talk about it gdp was not handed down from god on tablets of stone 
 it 's a measurement tool
 invented in the 20th century to address the challenges of the
 in the 21st century we face new challenges  aging obesity climate change and so on 
 to face those challenges  we need new tools of measurement new ways of valuing progress
  in people 's lives
