  i am going to talk about myself which i rarely do because i
 well for one thing i prefer to talk about things i know nothing about  and secondly  i 'm a recovering narcissist
  i didn 't know i was a narcissist actually i thought narcissism meant you loved yourself and then someone told me there is a flip side to it  
 so it 's actually drearier than self love it 's unrequited self love 
 i don 't feel i can afford a relapse  but i want
  explain how i came to design my own particular brand of comedy because i 've been through so many different forms of it i started with improvisation in a particular
 form of improvisation called theater games which
 had one rule which i always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society and the rule was you couldn 't deny the other person 's reality  
 you could only build on it  and of course we live in a society that 's all about contradicting other peoples ' reality it 's all about
  contradiction  which i think is why i 'm so sensitive to contradiction in general i see it everywhere
 like polls you know it 's
 always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of americans who don 't know the answer to any given question is always two percent
 seventy five percent of americans think alaska is part of canada but only two percent don 't know the
  effect that the debacle in argentina will have on the imf 's monetary policy 
  or this ad that i read in the new york times wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society  buying it from us screams good taste
  this that i found in a magazine called california lawyer in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at enron 
 surviving the slammer do 's and
 don
  and i suppose it 's a contradiction that i talk about science when i don 't know math you know because and by the way to i was so grateful to dean kamen for pointing out
 that one of the reasons that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don 't enter
 the fields of science and technology because for instance the reason i don 't do math is i was taught to do math and read at the same time
  time  
 so you 're six years old you 're reading snow white and the seven dwarves and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world  dwarves and prince charmings  
 and the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince 
 that 's why little girls don 't do math it 's too depressing
  by talking about science i also may as i did the other night incur the violent wrath of some scientists
 who were very upset with  me i used the word postmodern as if it were ok  and
 they got very upset one of them to his credit i think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument
  don 't engage in serious arguments i don 't approve of them
 because arguments of course are all about contradiction and they 're shaped by the values that i have questions with i have questions with the values of of newtonian science like rationality you 're supposed to be rational in an argument  
 well rationality is constructed by what christie hefner was talking about today that mind body split you know
  head is good body bad head is ego body id  when we say i as when rene descartes said i think therefore i am we mean the head 
 and as david lee roth sang in just a gigolo i ain 't got no body
  that 's how you get rationality
  and that 's why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head  that 's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor 
 that 's why you have the raspyni brothers whacking richard
 in the genital area and we 're laughing doubly then because he 's the
 's the other way that humor like art buchwald
 takes shots at the heads of state  it doesn 't make quite as much money as body humor i 'm sure 
 but nevertheless what makes us treasure you and and adore you
 there 's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though which is as much as we revere the
  i know this because i read in the new york times
 the ayn rand foundation took out a full page ad after september eleven  in which they said the problem is not iraq or iran  
 the problem in this country facing this country
 is the university professors and their spawn
  know how many of you have read it  and i 'm not an expert on sadomasochism but let
 me just read you a couple of random passages
 from page two hundred and seventeen the act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her was the kind of rapture she wanted when they
  lay together in bed it was as it had to be as the nature of the act demanded an act of violence 
 it was an act of clenched teeth and hatred it was the unendurable not a caress but a wave of pain  the agony as an act of passion 
 so you can imagine my surprise on reading in the new yorker
 that alan greenspan
  chairman of the federal reserve claims ayn rand as his intellectual mentor 
 it 's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix 
 bad enough we had to see j edgar hoover in a dress now we have to picture alan greenspan in a black leather corset with a butt tattoo that
  and ayn rand of course ayn rand is famous for a philosophy called objectivism which
 reflects another value of newtonian physics which is objectivity   objectivity basically is constructed in that same s & m way it 's
  the subject subjugating the object that 's how you assert yourself you make yourself the active voice  and the object is the passive no voice i was so fascinated by that oxygen commercial 
 i don 't know if
 you know this but
 maybe it 's different now or maybe you were making a statement but in many hospital nurseries across the country until very recently anyway  according to a book by jessica benjamin 
 the signs over the little boys cribs
  read i 'm a boy and the signs over the little girls cribs read it 's a girl yeah so
 the passivity was culturally
 projected onto the little girls 
 and this still goes on as i think i told you last year there 's a a poll that proves there was a poll that was
  given by time magazine in which only men were asked have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked and
 well yeah  well fifty eight percent said yes which
 i think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say have you ever had sex yes they don 't even wait for the rest of it and
 of course two
  is part of something i 'm very interested in because
 this is why frankly i believe in political correctness i do i think it can go too far i think ringling brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out
  in the new york times magazine we have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our asian elephant partners 
 maybe too far but you know
 i don 't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun
  of women or poor people making fun of rich people the same as rich people  i think you can make fun of the have but not the have nots which
 is why you don 't see me making fun of kenneth lay and his charming wife 
 what 's funny about being down to four houses 
 and i really learned this lesson during the during the sex scandals of the clinton administration
 or as i call them the good ol ' days 
 laughter when people i knew you know people who considered themselves liberal and everything else 
 were making fun of jennifer flowers and paula jones basically they were making fun of them for being
 trailer trash or white
  it seems i suppose a harmless prejudice and that you 're not really hurting anybody  until you read as i did 
 an ad in the los angeles times for sale white trash compactor
 i read a book by a woman named amy amy richlin who is the chair of the classics department at usc and the book is called the garden of priapus and she says that roman humor
 mirrors the construction of roman society so that that
 roman society was very top
  as ours is to some degree  and so was humor there always had to be the butt of a joke so it was always 
  the satirist like juvenal or martial represented
 the audience and he was going to make fun of the outsider  the person who didn 't share that subject status 
 and in stand up of course the
  comedian is supposed to dominate the audience a lot of heckling is
 the tension of trying to make sure
 that that the comedian is going to be able to dominate and overcome the heckler  and
 i got good at that when i was in stand up but i always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content to some degree
 of what you 're talking about  and i was looking for a form that didn 't have that and
 so i i wanted something that was more interactive i know that word is so
 debased now by
 the use of it by
  i really miss the old telemarketers now i 'll tell you that i do because at least there you stood a chance you know
 i used to actually hang up on them but then i read in dear abby that that was rude  so
 the next time that one called i let him get halfway through his spiel and then i said you sound sexy
  the interactivity allows the audience to shape
 what you 're going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world  
 and that 's really what i 'm looking for and i was sort of as i was starting to analyze what exactly it is that i do 
 i read a book
  called trickster makes this world by lewis hyde and
 it was like being psychoanalyzed i mean he had laid it all out and then coming to this conference i realized that most everybody here shared those 
  same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change trickster is a change agent  and the qualities that i 'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible
 to make change happen  and one of these is
 boundary crossing  i think this is what so in fact infuriated the scientists but
 i like to cross boundaries i like to as i said talk about things i know nothing about 
 i hope that 's my agent because you aren 't paying me anything
  think it 's good to talk about things i know nothing about because i bring a fresh viewpoint to it you know i 'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see like for instance a mime once or a meme as he called himself 
 he was a very selfish meme  and he said that
 i had to show more respect because it took up to eighteen years to learn how to do mime properly
 and i said well  that 's how you know only stupid people go into it 
 it only takes two years to learn how to talk 
 and you know people this is the problem with quote  objectivity unquote when you 're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you or share the same set
  of assumptions as you you start to think that that 's reality  like economists you know their definition of rational that we all act out of our own economic 
 self interest well look at michael hawley or look at dean kamen or look at my grandmother my grandmother always acted in other people 's interests whether they wanted her to or not
  an olympics in martyrdom my grandmother would have lost on purpose no
 you take the prize you 're young i 'm old
  fritz lanting is that his name actually said that he was a go between that 's an actual quality of the trickster and another is non oppositional strategies 
 and this is
 instead of contradiction where you
 deny the other person 's reality you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist i think there 's another philosophical construction
 i 'm not sure
 what it 's called but my example of it is a sign that i saw in a jewelry store it said ears pierced while you wait 
 there the alternative just boggles the imagination
  them up around five if that 's ok with you huh huh what 
 can 't hear you 
 and another attribute of the trickster
 is smart luck that accidents that louis kahn who talked about accidents this is another quality of the trickster the trickster has a mind that is
  prepared for the unprepared  that  
 and i will say this to the scientists that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly
 so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden
 problems with his
  i had no joke for that i just wanted to put the scientists in their place 
 but here 's how i think
 i like to make change and that is in making connections this is
 what i tend to see almost more than contradictions like the what do you call those toes of the gecko
  you know the toes of the gecko curling and uncurling like the fingers of michael moschen 
 i love connections like i 'll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe
 there are two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe one is space occupancy matter takes up space i guess
 the more you matter the more space you take up which explains the whole suv phenomenon 
 and the other one though is impenetrability
  well  in ancient rome impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity masculinity depended on you being the active penetrator  
 and then in economics there 's an active producer and a passive consumer  which explains why business always has to penetrate
  i mean why we forced china to open her markets and didn 't that feel good 
 and now we 're being penetrated you know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes you
 know we 're being penetrated  and i suspect by someone who actively dislikes us
  and what i hope to do when i make these connections is short circuit people 's thinking you know make you
 not follow your usual train of association but make you rewire
  literally when people say about the shock of recognition it 's literally 
  rewiring how you think
 i had a joke to go with this and i forgot it i 'm so sorry i 'm getting like
 the woman in that joke about have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother and
  mother is elderly and the mother goes right through a red light  and the daughter doesn 't want to say anything she doesn 't want to be like you 're too old to drive 
 and the mother goes through a second red light  and the daughter says  
 as tactfully as possible mom are you aware that you just went through two red lights and the mother says
  shock of recognition at the shock of recognition that completes the quadruple 
 i just want to say two more things one is another characteristic of trickster is that
 the trickster has to walk this fine line he has to
 poise  and you know the biggest hurdle for me in doing what i do is
 constructing my performance so that it 's prepared and unprepared
  finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared
  but being too prepared doesn 't leave room for the accidents to happen
 i was thinking about what
 moshe safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book hyde says that
 sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty  but to do that you have to
 lose all the other qualities because once you 're into beauty you 're into a finished thing you 're into
  something that occupies space and inhabits time it 's an actual thing  and
 it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty  
 but if you don 't do that if you allow for the accident to keep on happening you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength
  wave when you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility  and i like
 to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you 'll be on the wavelength of your audience  
 and the one final quality i want to say about trickster is that he doesn 't have a home he 's always
  i want to say to you richard in closing that in ted you 've created a home  and thank you for inviting me into it
