  want to start by doing an experiment i 'm
 going to play three videos of a rainy day  
 but i 've replaced the audio of one of the videos and instead of the sound of rain i 've added the sound of bacon frying
  so i want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is
  my point here isn 't really to make you hungry every time you see a rainy scene but it 's to show that our brains are conditioned to embrace the lies
 we 're not looking for accuracy  so
 on the subject of deception i wanted to quote one of my favorite authors in 
  the decay of lying 
 oscar wilde establishes the idea that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic
  comes from lying and deceiving  and telling beautiful untrue things  so
 when you 're watching a movie
 and a phone rings it 's not actually ringing  
 it 's been added later in postproduction in a studio all of the sounds you hear are fake  everything apart from the dialogue is
  fake when you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings 
 they haven 't really recorded the bird it sounds a lot more realistic if you record a sheet
 or shaking kitchen gloves 
 the burning of a cigarette up close
 it actually sounds a lot more authentic
 if you take a small saran wrap ball and release it
  no one was really harmed it 's actually breaking celery or frozen lettuce
 as easy as a trip to the supermarket and going to the vegetable section but it 's often a lot more complicated than that so let 's 
  together the creation of a sound effect one of my favorite stories comes from frank 
 he 's a contributor to our library and a great sound designer
  of the paramount team that won the oscar for best sound for the hunt for red october in this cold war classic 
 in the ' 90s they were asked to produce the sound of the propeller of the submarine so they had a small problem they couldn 't really find a submarine in west hollywood 
 so basically
  what they did is 
 they went to a friend 's swimming pool  and frank performed a cannonball or bomba 
 they placed an underwater mic and an overhead mic outside the swimming pool so here 's what the underwater mic sounds like
  pitched it one octave down sort of like slowing down a record 
 and then they removed a lot of the high frequencies 
 and pitched it down another octave 
 and then they added a little bit of
  and by looping and repeating that sound they got this 
 churns so creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion that we 're inside
  you 've created your sounds and you 've synced them to the image you want those sounds to live in the world of the story  
 and one the best ways to do that is to add reverb  
 so this is the first audio tool i want to talk about reverberation or reverb is the
 persistence of the
 sound after the original sound has ended so it 's sort of like
 the all the reflections from the materials the objects and the walls around the sound take for example the sound of a gunshot  the original 
  sound is less than half a second long 
 by adding reverb  we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom gunshot reverbs in bathroom
  gives us a lot of information about the space between the listener and the original sound source if the sound is the taste then
 reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound but reverb can do a lot more listening
  to a sound with a lot less reverberation than the on screen action is going to immediately signify to us that we 're listening to a commentator 
 to an objective narrator that 's not participating in the on screen action  
  in cinema are often heard with zero reverb because that 's how it would sound if someone was speaking inside our ear 
 on the completely other side  adding a lot of reverb to a voice is going to make us think that we 're listening to a flashback 
 or perhaps that we 're inside the head of a character
 or that we 're listening to the voice of god or even more powerful
  what are some other tools or hacks that sound designers use  
 well  here 's a really big one 
 it 's silence a few moments of silence is going to make us pay attention 
 and in
 the western
  world we 're not really used to verbal silences they 're considered awkward or rude  
 so silence preceding verbal communication
 can create a lot of tension  but imagine a really big hollywood movie  where it 's full of explosions and automatic
 automatic guns loud stops being loud anymore
  after a while so in a yin yang way silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect  
 but what does silence mean well  it depends how it 's used in each film 
 silence can place us inside the head of a character or provoke thought  we often
  being deep in thought  
 but
 apart from having one meaning  silence becomes a blank canvas upon which
 the viewer is invited to the paint their own thoughts  but i want to make it clear  there is no such thing as
  and i know this sounds like the most pretentious ted talk statement ever  but
 even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation and zero external sounds you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood  
 and in cinema traditionally  there was never a silent moment because of the sound of the projector 
 and even in today 's dolby world 
 there 's not really any moment of silence
  you listen around you 
 there 's always some sort of noise 
 now since there 's no such thing as silence what do filmmakers and sound designers use  well  
 as a synonym they often use
 are the unique background sounds that are specific to each location each location has a unique sound
 and each room has a unique sound which is called room tone so here 's a recording of a market in morocco voices 
 music and here 's a recording of times square in new york
  inside the room the ventilation  the heating the fridge here 's a recording of my apartment in brooklyn
 so  birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality 
 perhaps because as a species  we 've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years birds
 on the other hand industrial sounds
 have been introduced to us a little more recently 
 even though i really like them personally they 've been used by one of my heroes david lynch  and his sound designer alan  splet industrial sounds often carry negative connotations 
 now sound effects can tap into our emotional memory
 occasionally they can be so significant that they become a character in a movie 
 the sound of thunder may indicate divine intervention or anger 
 church bells can remind us of the passing of time or perhaps our own mortality
 ring and breaking of glass can indicate the end of a relationship
 or a friendship
 played very loud may remind us
 of animal howls in nature and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear
  be seen that 's what we call offscreen sounds or 
  sounds
 well  the term acousmatic comes from pythagoras in ancient greece  who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years not revealing himself to his disciples  
 i think the mathematician and philosopher thought that 
 in that way
 his students might focus more on the voice and his words and its meaning  rather than the visual of him speaking so sort of like the wizard of oz or one
 thousand nine hundred and eighty four 's big brother  separating the voice from its
  separating cause and effect sort of creates a sense of ubiquity or
 and therefore authority  there 's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound nuns in monasteries
 in rome and venice used to sing in rooms up in galleries
 close to the ceiling creating the illusion that we 're listening to angels up in the sky
  wagner famously created the hidden orchestra that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience  and one of my heroes  aphex twin famously hid in dark corners of clubs 
 i think what all these masters knew is that by hiding the source you create a sense of mystery this has been seen in cinema over and over with hitchcock and ridley scott in
  without knowing its source is going to create some sort of tension  
 also  
 it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have and can show something that wasn 't there during filming  
 and if all this sounds a little theoretical i wanted to play a little video
 sort of trying to to demonstrate with these tools
 is that sound is a language  it can trick us by transporting us geographically  
 it can change the mood it can set the pace it
 can make us laugh or it can make us scared
 on a personal level i fell in love with that language a few years ago  and somehow managed to make it into some sort of
  profession  and i think with our work through the sound library we 're trying to kind of
 expand the vocabulary of that language and
 in that way  we want to offer the right tools to sound designers  filmmakers and video game and
  to keep telling even better stories and creating even more beautiful lies  so thanks for listening
