  why can 't we solve these problems  
 we know what they are something always seems to stop us 
  broke off the ross ice shelf in the newspaper it said it was all part of a normal process a
 little bit further on in the article
 it said a loss that would normally take the ice shelf
  opposite meanings 
 if we walk into the b15 iceberg when we leave here today  we 're going to bump into something
 a thousand feet tall
  and it 's going to weigh two gigatons i 'm sorry there 's nothing normal about this  
 and yet i think it 's this perspective of us as humans
 to look at our world through the lens of normal
 is one of the forces that stops us developing real
  only ninety days
 after this  arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred  
 it was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome this is the code
 that 's in every single one of our fifty trillion cells that makes us who we are
 and what we are and if we just take one cell 's worth of this code
 and unwind it
  it  it 's a meter long 
 two nanometers thick two nanometers is twenty atoms
 in thickness  and i wondered what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places
  the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms and what
 if we could get exquisite control
 over the essence of energy the electron 
 so i started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists i could at universities
 whose collective discoveries
  have the chance to take us there  and we formed a company
 to build on their extraordinary ideas  
 six and a half years later 
 a hundred and eighty researchers they have some amazing developments in the lab and i will show you three of those today  
 such that we can stop burning up our planet
 and instead we can generate all the energy we need
 right where we are cleanly  safely and cheaply
  think of the space that we spend most of our time a
 tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun we like the light that comes into the room but in the middle of summer all that heat is coming into the room that we 're trying to keep cool 
 in winter exactly the opposite is happening we 're trying to heat up the space that we 're in and all that is trying to get out through the window wouldn
 't it be really great
  if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in one of the materials
 that can do this
 is a remarkable material carbon that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite
 is blasted by a vapor  and when the vaporized carbon
 condenses it condenses back into a different form  chickenwire rolled up 
 but this chickenwire carbon  called a carbon nanotube 
 is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs  
 it 's a thousand times more conductive than copper
  possible 
 one of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look
 and act very differently you think of carbon as black 
 carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent
  and when it 's in this form if i combine it with a polymer and affix it to your window
 when it 's in its
 colored state it will reflect away all heat and light and when it 's in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through
 and any combination in between to change its state by the way
 takes two volts from a millisecond pulse  and once you 've changed its state it stays there
 until you change its state again  as we were working on this incredible discovery at university of florida we were told to go down the corridor
 to visit another scientist and he was working on a pretty incredible thing imagine
  we didn 't have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night we
 'd have to see at night right 
 this lets you do it  
 it 's a nanomaterial two nanomaterials a detector and an imager the total width of it
 is six hundred times
  smaller
 than the width of a decimal place  
 and it takes all the infrared available at night  converts it into an electron in
 the space of two small films and is enabling you to play an image
 which you can see through
  i 'm going to show
 to tedsters the first time this operating  firstly i 'm going to show you the transparency 
 transparency is key  
 it 's a film that you can look through and then i 'm going to turn the lights out 
 and you can see off a tiny film incredible clarity
  as we were working on this it dawned on us 
 this is taking infrared radiation wavelengths and converting it into electrons what
 if we combined it
 with this  suddenly you 've converted energy
  into an electron
 on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window  but because it 's flexible  
 it can be on any surface whatsoever 
 the power plant of tomorrow
 is no power plant 
 we talked about generating and using
 we want to talk about storing energy and unfortunately
 the best thing we 've got going is something that was developed in france a hundred and fifty years ago the lead acid battery in terms of dollars per what 's stored  it 's simply the best 
 knowing that we 're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power we went to a group at university of texas at dallas  and we gave them this diagram  it was
  in actually a diner outside of dallas fort worth airport we said could you build this and these scientists instead of laughing at us said yeah 
 and what they built
 was ebox ebox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside  hold it until you need it 
 and then be able to release it and pass it off 
 being able to do that
  means
 that i can generate energy cleanly  efficiently
 and cheaply right where i am  it 's my energy  
 and if i don 't need it i can convert it back up on the window to energy light and beam it line of site 
 to your place  
 and for that i do not need
  need an electric grid between us the grid of tomorrow
 is no grid 
 and energy  clean efficient energy 
 will one day be free 
 if you do this you get the last puzzle piece  which is water
 each of us 
 every day 
 need just eight glasses of this because we 're human 
 when we run out of water as we are in some parts of the world and soon to be in other parts of the world we 're going to have to get this from the sea
  and that 's going to require us to build desalination plants  nineteen trillion dollars is what we 're going to have to spend 
 these also require tremendous amounts of energy in fact it 's going to require twice the world 's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water we
 're simply not going to do that but in a world where energy is freed
 and transmittable easily and cheaply we can take any water wherever we
  are and turn it into whatever we need 
 i 'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists 
 no kinder than many of the people in the world  but they have a magic look at the world 
 and i 'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world it 's been a long time in coming for me
  years ago  i saw a photograph
 in the paper  it was taken by kevin carter who went to the sudan
 to document their famine there i 've carried this photograph with me every day since then  
 it 's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst
 by any standard
 this is wrong it 's just wrong
  we can do better than this we should do better than this  
 and whenever i go round to somebody who says you know what you 're working on something
  that 's too difficult it 'll never happen you don 't have enough money you don 't have enough time there 's something much more interesting around the corner 
 i say 
 try saying that to her that 's what i say in my mind  and i just say thank you and i go on to the next one 
 this is why we have to solve our
  and i know the answer as to how
 is to be able to get exquisite control
 over a building block of nature the stuff of life the simple electron  thank you
