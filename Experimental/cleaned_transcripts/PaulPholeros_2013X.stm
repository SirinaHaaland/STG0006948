  the idea of eliminating poverty
 is a great goal i don 't think anyone in this room would disagree what worries me
 is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars
 use the words it all just sounds so so simple 
 now i 've got no bucket of money today
 and i 've got no policy to release  and i certainly haven 't got a guitar i 'll leave that to others  
 but i do have an idea and that idea is called housing for health
  housing for health works with poor people it works in the places where they live  and the work is done to improve their health 
 over the last twenty eight years this tough grinding dirty work
 has been done by literally thousands of people
  more recently overseas and their work has proven
 that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments 
 it can improve health and it can play a part in reducing if not eliminating poverty  
 i 'm going to start where the story began one thousand nine 
 in central australia a man called yami lester an aboriginal man was running a health service
  percent of what walked in the door in terms of illness was infectious disease
 third world developing world infectious disease  caused by a poor living environment  
 yami assembled a team in alice springs  he got a medical doctor 
  a team of local aboriginal people
 to work on this project  yami told us at that first meeting there 's no money 
 always a good start no money  
 you have six months  and i want you to start on a project which in his language he called uwankara palyanku kanyintjaku 
  a plan to stop people getting sick a profound brief 
 that was our task 
 first step  the medical doctor went away for about six months  
 and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals what were we aiming at 
  big ideas need big words  and preferably a lot of them 
 this didn 't fit the bill what i didn 't see and what you can 't see
 was that he 'd assembled thousands of pages of local
  national and international health research
 that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets  
 the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason the aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people
 were most commonly illiterate  so the story had to be told in pictures of
  we worked with the community not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn 't understand  so we had the goals
 and each one of these goals and i won 't go through them all puts at the center the person
 and their health issue and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their
  and the highest priority you see on the screen is washing people once a day  particularly children and
 i hope most of you are thinking what that sounds simple now  i 'm going to ask you all a very personal question 
 this morning before you came who could have had
 a wash using a shower i 'm not going to ask if you had a shower because i 'm too polite
  here could have had a shower this morning  
 i 'm going to ask you to do some more work  i want you all to select one of the houses of the twenty five houses you see on the screen i want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head 
 have you all got a house  i 'm going to ask you to live there for a few months so make sure you 've got it right it 's in the northwest of western australia very pleasant place  
 ok  let 's see if your shower in that house
  house is working 
 i hear some aw and i hear some ah 
 if you get a green tick your shower 's working you and your kids are fine if you get a red cross 
 well  i 've looked carefully around the room and it 's not going to make much difference to this crew  
 why because you 're all too old  i know that 's going to come as a shock to some of you but you are and before you get offended and leave
  i 've got to say that being too old in this case means that pretty much everyone in the room i think is over five years of age  
 we 're really concerned with kids naught to five  and why  
 washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs  the common infectious diseases of the eyes the ears  
 the chest and the skin that if they
  occur in the first five years of life permanently damage
 those organs they leave a lifelong remnant  
 that means that by the age of five  you can 't see as well for the rest of your life you can 't hear as well for the rest of your life  
 you can 't breathe as well you 've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five  
 and even skin infection  which we originally thought
  wasn 't that big a problem  mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly increased chance of renal failure  needing dialysis at age forty 
 this is a big deal so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids 
 those ticks and crosses represent the seven thousand eight hundred houses we 've looked at nationally around australia the same proportion what you see on the screen
 thirty five percent of those not so famous houses lived in by fifty thousand indigenous people thirty five percent had a working shower 
 ten percent of those same seven thousand eight hundred houses had safe electrical systems and fifty eight percent
 of those houses had a working toilet 
 these are by a simple
  test in the case of the shower  does it have hot and cold water two taps that work
  a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body  and a drain that takes the water away not
 not beautiful not elegant just that they function and the same tests for the electrical system and the toilets housing for health projects
  aren 't about measuring failure they 're actually about improving houses 
 we start on day one of every project we 've learned we don 't make promises we don 't do reports  
 we arrive in the morning with tools tons of equipment  trades and we train up a local team on the first day to start
  by the evening of the first day a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning 
 that work continues for six to twelve months until all the houses are improved and we 've spent our budget of
 seven thousand five hundred dollars total per house that 's our average budget 
 at the end of six months to a year we test every house again  it 's very easy to spend money  it 's very difficult
 to improve the function of all those parts of the house and for a whole house
  nine healthy living practices  we test check and fix two hundred and fifty items in every house 
 and these are the results we can get with our seven thousand five hundred dollars  
 we can get showers up to eighty six percent working we can get electrical systems up to seventy seven percent working and we can get ninety percent of toilets working in those seven
  the teams do a great job  and that 's their work  i think there 's an obvious question
 that i hope you 're thinking about why do we have to do this work  why are the houses in such poor
  seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance the sort of things that happen in all our houses things wear out 
 should have been done by state government or local government simply not done the house doesn 
  percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction literally things that are built upside down and back to front they don 't work we have to fix them 
 and if you 've lived in australia in the last thirty years  the final cause
  will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses it 's one of the almost 
  pieces of evidence which i 've never seen evidence for 
 that 's always reeled out as that 's the problem with indigenous housing well nine percent of what we spend is damage misuse or abuse of any sort  
 we argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem and we 'll go a lot further than that the
  people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution 
 seventy five percent of our national team in australia over seventy five at the minute
 are actually local indigenous people from the communities we work in 
 they do all aspects of the work in
 two thousand and ten for example
 all over australia and the torres strait islands all states working to improve the houses where they and their families live and that 's an important thing 
 our work 's always had a focus on on health that 's the key  
 the developing world bug trachoma causes blindness it
  and yet the picture you see behind is in an aboriginal community in the late 
  percent of school aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes doing damage ok
 what do we do 
 well  first thing we do 
 we get showers working why because that flushes the bug out we put washing facilities in the school as well so kids can wash their faces many times during the day we wash the bug out 
 second the
  doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick  so what do we do we call up the doctor of dust and there is such a person  
 he was loaned to us by a mining company he controls dust on mining company sites  
 and he came out and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground the wind driven dust
  so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids  so we used dirt
 to stop dust  we did it he provided us dust monitors  we tested and we reduced the dust 
 then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally so how do we do that well  we call up the doctor of flies and yes there is a doctor of flies 
 as our aboriginal mate said you white fellows ought to get out more
  and the doctor of flies very quickly determined that
 there was one fly that carried the bug  he could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide 
 they could trap the flies send them to him in perth 
 when the bug was in the gut he 'd send back by return post some dung beetles the dung beetles ate the camel dung 
 the flies died through lack of food
 and trachoma dropped  and over the year  
 trachoma dropped radically in this place  and stayed low we changed the environment not just treated the eyes  
 and finally you get a good eye all these small health gains and small pieces of the
 puzzle make a big difference the new south wales department of health that radical organization did an independent trial
 over three years to look at ten years of the work we 've been doing in these sorts of projects in new south wales and they found a forty percent reduction 
 in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment a forty percent
  just to show that the principles we 've used in australia can be used in other places i 'm just going to go to one other place and that 's nepal and what a beautiful place to go we
 were asked by a small village of six hundred people to go in and make toilets
 where none existed health was poor we went in with no grand plan no grand promises of a great program
  just the offer to build two toilets for two families  it was during the design of the first toilet
 that i went for lunch invited by the family into their main room of the house  it was choking with smoke people were cooking on their only fuel source  green timber the smoke coming off that timber is choking and in an enclosed house you
  later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure  so all of a sudden we had two problems we were there 
 originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground that 's fine  but all of a sudden now there was a second problem  
  take human waste  take animal waste put it into a chamber out of that extract biogas  methane gas  
 the gas gives three to four hours cooking a day clean  smokeless and free
 for the family i put it to you is
 this eliminating poverty  
 and the answer from the nepali team who 's working at the minute would say don 't be ridiculous we have three
  million more toilets to build before we can even make
 a stab at that claim and i don 't pretend anything else  but as we all sit here today 
 there are now over one hundred toilets built in this village and a couple nearby  well over one thousand people use those toilets  
 yami lama  he 's a young
  he 's got significantly less gut infection
 because he 's now got toilets and there isn 't human waste on the ground  
 kanji maya  she 's a mother and a proud one  she 's probably right now cooking lunch
 for her family
 on biogas smokeless fuel her lungs have got better and they 'll get better as time increases because she 's not cooking in the same smoke  
 surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it 's shed the gas  he puts it on his crops
  he 's trebled his crop income more food for the family and more money for the family and finally bishnu 
 the leader of the team has now understood that not only have we built toilets we 've also built
 a team  and that team is now working in two villages where they 're training up the next two villages to keep the work expanding  and that to me is the key
 the problem  
 we 've never found that the problem poor living environment 
 poor housing and the bugs that do people harm  
 none of those are limited by geography by skin color or by religion none of them
  the common link between all the work we 've had to do is one thing and that 's poverty
  nelson mandela said in the mid 2000s not too far from here he said that like slavery and apartheid 
 poverty is not natural 
 it is man made and can be overcome and eradicated
  by the actions of human beings i want to end by saying it 's been the actions
 of
 thousands of ordinary human beings doing i think extraordinary work  that have actually improved health 
 and maybe only in a small way reduced poverty  thank you very much for your
