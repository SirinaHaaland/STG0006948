  what i am always thinking about is
 is what this session is about which is called simplicity and almost i would almost call it being simple minded but in the best sense of the word  
 i 'm trying to figure out two very simple things  how to live
  and how to die  period that 's all i 'm trying to do all day long 
 and i 'm also trying to have some meals and have some snacks and you know and yell at yell at my children and do all the normal things that keep you grounded 
 so i was
 fortunate enough to be born
 a very dreamy
  my older sister was busy torturing my parents and they were busy torturing her 
 i was lucky enough to be completely ignored  which is a fabulous thing actually i want to tell you so 
 i was able to completely daydream my way through my life
 and i finally daydreamed my way into nyu
 at a very good time in one thousand nine 
 where i met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of
  i was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him and
 feminists hated us and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end  but
 i kept writing bad poetry and he didn 't blow up the math building but he went to cuba but i gave him the money because i was
 from riverdale so i had more money than he did and that was a good thing to help
 but then he came back and things happened and i decided i really hated my writing that it was
 awful awful purple prose  
 and i decided that i wanted to tell but i still wanted to tell a narrative story and i still wanted to tell my stories so i decided that i would start to draw how hard could that
  what happened was that i started just becoming an editorial illustrator through  you know sheer
 whatever sheer ignorance  and we started a
 a studio well tibor really started the studio called m & co and the premise of m & co was  we don 't know anything but that 's all right we 're going to do it anyway and as a matter of fact it 's better not to know anything because
 if you know too
  you 're stymied so  the premise in the studio was there are no boundaries there is no fear
  and i and my full time job i landed the best job on earth was to daydream and to actually come up with absurd ideas that fortunately there were enough people there and it was a team  it was a collective it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas but
 the point was that i was there as as myself as a dreamer  and so some of the things i mean it was a long history of m
 clearly we also needed to make some money  so we decided
 we would create a series of products  and some of the watches there
 attempting to be beautiful and humorous maybe not attempting hopefully succeeding that
 to be able to talk about content to break apart what you normally expect to use humor and surprise elegance and
 in your work was really important to us it was a very high  it was a very
 impersonal time in design and we wanted to say  
 the content is what 's important not the package not the wrapping 
 you really have to be journalists you have to be inventors you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything
  the good news is that i have a dog
 and though i don 't know if i believe in luck i don 't know what i believe in it 's a very complicated question but i do know that before i go away i crank his tail seven times so whenever he sees a suitcase in the house
 because everybody 's always you know leaving they 're always cranking this wonderful dog 's tail and he runs to the other room  but
 i am able to make the transition from working for children and from working for adults to children and back and
  forth because you know i can say that i 'm immature and in a way 
 that 's true
  i don 't really i mean i could tell you that i didn 't understand
 i 'm not proud of it but i didn 't understand let 's say ninety five percent of the talks at this conference  but i have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and i have a gorgeous onion from murray  gell mann 's talk
  i 'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and and finding out something new so in writing for children it seems simple 
 and it is you have to condense a story into
  and what you have to do is you really have to edit down to what you want to say and hopefully you 're not talking down to kids and you 're not talking in such a way that you you know couldn 't stand reading it after 
  one time so i hopefully am writing you know books that are good for children and for adults but the painting reflects i don 't think differently for children than i do for adults 
 wonderful looking friends this is andrew gatz and he walked in through the door and i said you sit down there you know i take lots of photos 
 and the bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair so 
 i get to put in all of the things that i love hopefully a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels and hopefully different different kinds of humor will evolve  and the books are really journals of my life i never
 i don 't like plots
 i don 't know what a plot means i can 't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning you know 
 beginning middle and end it really scares me 
 because my life is too random and too confused and i enjoy it that way 
 but anyway so we were in venice  
 and this is our room and i had this dream that i was wearing this fantastic green gown  and i was looking out the window  and it was really a beautiful thing and so i was able to put that into this
 story which is an alphabet and hopefully go on to something else the letter c had other things in it i was fortunate also to meet the man who 's sitting on the bed  though i gave him hair over here and he doesn 't have hair well
 he has some hair but well he used to have hair
 and with him i was able to do a project that was really fantastic i work for the new yorker and i do covers and
  happened and it was you know a complete
 and utter end of the world as we knew it 
 and rick and i were on our way to a party in the bronx and somebody said bronxistan and somebody said ferreristan and we came up with this new yorker cover  which we were able to we didn 't know what we were doing we weren 't trying to be funny we weren 't trying to be well
 we were trying to be funny actually that 's not true  
 we hoped we 'd be funny but we didn 't know it would be a cover  and we didn 't know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people and it really became the
 i don 't know you know it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on 
 and from you know fattushis to taxistan to you know for the fashtoonks botoxia
  we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign  who are what 's going on over here who are these people what are these tribes and
 david remnick who was really wonderful about it had one problem he didn 't like al
 because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer 's but you know we said david who 's going to know  
  it was a good thing
  you know
 in the course of my life i never know what 's going to happen and that 's kind of the beauty part and we were on cape cod a place obviously of great inspiration and i picked up this book 
 the elements of style at a yard sale and i didn 't and i 'd never used it in school because i was too busy writing poems and flunking out and
  what sitting in cafes  but i picked it up and i started reading it and i thought this book is amazing i said  people should know about this book 
 so i decided it needed a few it needed a lift it needed a few illustrations and
 basically i called the you know i convinced the white estate and what an intersection of like you know  
  main wasp family here i am saying i 'd like to do something to this book and they said yes and they left me completely alone which was a gorgeous wonderful thing  and
 i took the examples that they gave and just did fifty six paintings basically so  this is i don 't know if you can read this well susan this is a fine mess you are in and when you 're dealing with grammar which is  you know  
  wrote such wonderful whimsical and actually strunk and then you come to the rules and you know  there are lots of grammar things do you mind me asking a question do you mind my asking a question 
 would could should  or would should could and would is coco chanel 's lover should is edith sitwell and could is an august sander
 subject and he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug
  love very much  
 and then be obscure clearly be wild of tongue in a way we can understand e b white wrote us a number of rules which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time  
 or you can ignore them  which i do or you can i don 't know what you know eat a sandwich so 
 what i did when i was painting was i started singing because i really adore singing and i think that music is the highest form of all art
  so i commissioned a wonderful composer nico muhly who
 wrote nine songs using the text and we performed this fantastic evening
 of he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals i played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the new york public library
 where you 're supposed to be very very quiet and it was a phenomenally wonderful event which we hopefully will do
  some more  who knows the new york 
 op ed page asked me to do a column and they said you can do whatever you want so once a month for the last year i 've been doing a column called the principles of uncertainty which you know 
 i don 't know who heisenberg is but i know i can throw that around now  you know it 's the principles of uncertainty so  
 you know  i 'm going to read quickly and probably i 'm going to edit some because i don 't have that
  much time left
 a few of the columns and basically i was so you know  it was so amusing because i said well how much space do i have and they said well you know it 's the internet and i said yes but how much space do i have 
 and they said it 's unlimited it 's unlimited ok  so the first one i was very timid and i 'll
 begin how can i tell you everything that is in my heart impossible to begin 
  begin with the hapless dodo and i talk about the dodo and how the dodo became extinct
 and then i talk about spinoza as the last dodo was dying spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything called eudaemonia 
 and then he breathed his last with loved ones around him and i know that he had chicken soup also as his last meal i happen to know it for a fact  
 and then he died and there was no more spinoza extinct 
  we don 't have a stuffed spinoza but we do have a stuffed pavlov 's dog 
 and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st petersburg in russia and there he is with this horrible electrical box on his rump
 in this fantastic  decrepit palace 
 and i think it must have been a very very dark day when the bolsheviks arrived maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs but stalin was a paranoid man even more than my father
  and decided his top people had to be extinctified which i think i made up which is a good thing
  and so this is a chart of you know just a small chart because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed so shot dead  smacked over the head  
 you know thrown away 
 nabokov 's family fled russia how could the young nabokov sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair  leafing through a book and butterflies  imagine such
  such loss 
 and then i want to tell you that this is a map so my beautiful mother 's family fled russia as well  
 too many pogroms leaving the shack the wild blueberry woods the geese  the river sluch they went to palestine and then america 
 and my mother drew this map for me of the united states of america  and that is my dna
  who i grew up with
 had no use for facts whatsoever facts were actually
 banished from our home  and so  if you see that texas you know texas and california are under canada  and that south carolina is on top of north carolina this is the home that i grew up in  ok  so it 's a miracle that i 'm here today 
 but actually it 's not it 's actually a wonderful thing  but then she says tel aviv and lenin which is the town they came from and
  sorry the rest unknown thank you but in her lexicon sorry the rest unknown thank you is sorry the rest unknown go to hell because she couldn 't care less 
 the impossibility of february 
 is that february 's a really wretched month in new york and the images for me conjure up these really awful things well
 not so awful i received a box in the mail and
  was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead  
 and i say i hope he 's not really dead just enjoying a refreshing lie down in the snow but the caption says he is dead 
 and actually he was i think he 's dead though i don 't know maybe he 's not dead 
 and this woman leans over in anguish not about that man but about all sad things it happens quite often in february 
 there 's consoling 
 this man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase and
  basically you know  i guess onions are a theme here and he says it is impossible not to lie it is february and not lying is impossible and i really spend a lot of time wondering how much truth 
  do we tell what is it that we 're actually what story are we actually telling how do we know when we are ourselves how do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories you know are real sentences
  fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying  i 'm going to quickly go through this 
 a quote by bertrand russell all the labor of all the ages all the devotion all the inspiration all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction 
 so now my friends if that is true and it is true what is the point a complicated question  and so you
 i talk to my friends and i go to plays where they 're singing russian songs oh my god you know what could we have no we don 't have time  
 i taped my aunt i taped my aunt singing a song in russian from the you know could we have it for a second 
 do you have that
  the elements of style
