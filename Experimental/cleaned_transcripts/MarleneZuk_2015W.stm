  people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying at least according to a one thousand nine hundred and
 seventy three book of lists survey which
 which preceded all those
 online best worst funniest lists that you
 see today  only heights and public speaking
 exceeded
 the six legged as sources of fear  
 and i suspect if you had put spiders in there the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart  
 now i am not one of those
  really love insects i think they 're interesting and beautiful and sometimes even cute 
 and i 'm not alone for centuries some of the greatest minds in science from charles darwin to e o wilson 
 have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on earth 
 well
  why is that what is that keeps us coming back to insects 
 some of it of course is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them they 're more numerous than any other kind of animal we don 't even know how many species of insects there are because new ones are being discovered all the time  
 there are at least a million  maybe as many as ten million 
 this means that you could have an
  and not have to reuse a species for over eighty thousand years 
 take that pandas and kittens 
 more seriously 
 insects are essential we need them 
 it 's been estimated that one out of every three bites of food is made possible by a pollinator  
 scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure
  of our nervous systems to how our genes and dna work  
 but what i love most about insects is what they can tell us about our own behavior 
 insects seem like they do everything that people do they meet they mate they fight they break up 
 and they do so with what looks like love or
  but what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own and that difference can be really illuminating 
 there 's nowhere where that 's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests sex  
 now i will maintain and i think i can defend what may seem like a surprising statement 
 i think sex in insects is more interesting
  and the wild variety that we see
 makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female of
 course to start with 
 a lot of insects don 't need to have sex at all to reproduce female aphids can make little tiny clones of themselves without ever mating  
 virgin birth right there on your rose bushes
  when they do have sex even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm there are some kinds of fruit flies
 whose sperm is longer than the male 's own body  and that 's important because the males use their sperm to compete 
 now male insects do compete with weapons like the horns on these beetles  
 but they also compete after mating with their sperm  
 dragonflies and
 damselflies have penises that look kind of like swiss army knives with all of the attachments pulled out 
 they use these formidable devices
 like scoops to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with 
 so what
  not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow which  
 given this is probably just as well
 and also did i mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects so no that 's not the point  but
 what i think insects do is break a lot of the rules that we
  humans have about the sex roles 
 so people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version of what males and females are like so that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive and females are passive and coy
  's own body and
  they 're interesting
  a lot of insects
  supposed to be dominant and
  i really love
