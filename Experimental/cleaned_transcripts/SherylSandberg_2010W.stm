  so for any of us in this room today let 's start out by admitting we 're lucky  
 we don 't live in the world our mothers lived in our grandmothers lived in where career choices for women were so limited  
 and if you 're in
  room today most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights and amazingly  we still live in a world where some women don 't have them  
 but all that aside  we still have a problem and it 's a real problem  and the problem is this 
 women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world  
 the numbers tell the story quite clearly one hundred
  and ninety heads of state nine are women 
 of all the people in parliament in the world  thirteen percent are women 
 in the corporate sector women at the top c level jobs board seats tops out at fifteen sixteen percent the numbers have not moved since two thousand and two and are going in the wrong direction and
 even in the non profit world a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women women at the top twenty percent
  we also have another problem  which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment a recent study in the u s showed that 
 of married senior managers two thirds of the married men had children and only one third of the married women had children a couple of years ago i
  in new york and i was pitching a deal  and i was in one of those fancy new york private equity offices you can picture  
 and i 'm in the meeting it 's about a three hour meeting and two hours in there needs to be that bio break and everyone stands up  
 and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed  and i realized
 he doesn 't know where the women 's room is in his office 
 so i start looking around for moving boxes figuring they just moved in but i don 't see any and so i said did you just move into this
  office and he said no we 've been here about a year and i said are you telling me
 that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year 
 and he looked at me and he said yeah  or maybe you 're the only one who had to go to the bathroom 
 so the question is how are we going to fix this how do we change
  these numbers at the top  how do we make this different  i want to start out by saying i talk about this about keeping women in the workforce
 because i really think that 's the answer 
 in the high income part of our workforce in the people who end up at the top fortune five hundred ceo jobs or the equivalent in other industries
 the problem i am convinced is that women are dropping
  out  now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women i want to talk about none of that today even though that 's all really important 
 today i want to focus on what we can do as individuals  
 what are the messages we need to tell ourselves what are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us what are the messages we tell our daughters 
 now at the outset
  want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments i don 't have the right answer i don 't even have it for myself  i left
 san francisco where i live on monday and i was getting on the plane for this conference and my daughter who 's three when i dropped her off at preschool did that whole hugging the leg crying mommy don 't get on the plane thing 
  i feel guilty sometimes  i know no women  
 whether they 're at home or whether they 're in the workforce who don 't feel that sometimes so i 'm not saying that staying in the workforce
 is the right thing for everyone my talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce  and i think there are three 
 one  sit at the table two make your partner a real partner
  don 't leave before you leave  
 number one sit at the table just a couple weeks ago at facebook we hosted a very senior government official and he came in to meet with senior
 execs from around silicon valley  
 and everyone kind of sat at the table he had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department  and i kind of said to them
  sit at the table and they sat on the side of the room 
 when i was in college my senior year i took a course called european intellectual history don 't you love that kind of thing from college i
 wish i could do that now  and i took it with my roommate carrie who was then a brilliant literary student and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar
 and my brother smart guy but a 
  the three of us take this class together  
 and then carrie reads all the books in the original greek and latin goes to all the lectures  
 i read all the books in english and go to most of the lectures  my brother is kind of busy  he reads one book of twelve and goes to a couple of lectures  marches 
  himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored  
  three of us go to the exam together  and we sit down  and we sit there for three hours and our little blue notebooks 
  we walk out we look at each other and we say how did you do 
 and carrie says boy i feel like i didn 't really draw out the main point on the hegelian dialectic 
 and i say god i really wish i had really connected john locke 's theory of property with the philosophers that follow 
 and my brother says i got the top grade in the class
  you got the top grade in the class you don 't know anything 
 the problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows 
 women systematically underestimate their own abilities if you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like gpas men get it wrong slightly high and women get it wrong slightly low 
 women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce a study in the last two years
  of people entering the workforce out of college showed that fifty seven percent of boys entering or men i guess 
 are negotiating their first salary and only seven percent of women
  and most importantly 
 men attribute their success to themselves and women attribute it to other external factors  if you ask men why they did a good job they 'll say
 obviously why are you even asking if you ask women why they did a good job what they 'll say is someone helped them they got lucky they worked really hard  
 why does this matter  boy it matters a lot  because no one gets to the corner office
 by sitting on the side not at the table  and no one gets the
 promotion if they don 't think they deserve their success or they don 't even understand their own success  
 i wish the answer were easy  i wish i could go tell all the young women i work for these fabulous women believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself own your own success 
 i wish i could tell that to my daughter but it
 's not that simple because what the data shows above all else is one thing  
 which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated
  for women  and everyone 's nodding because we all know this to be true  
 there 's a really good study that shows this really well  there 's a famous harvard business school study on a woman named heidi roizen  
 and she 's an operator in a company in silicon valley  and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture
  in two thousand and two not so long ago a professor who was then at columbia university took that case and made it [ howard ] roizen  
 and he gave the case out both of them to two groups of students  he changed exactly one word 
 heidi to howard but that one word made a really big difference  
 he then surveyed the students  and the good news was the students both men and women  thought heidi and howard were equally competent and that 's good 
 the bad news was that everyone
  liked howard he 's a great guy you want to work for him you want to spend the day fishing with him but heidi 
 not so sure she 's a little out for herself she 's a little political you 're not sure you 'd want to work for her 
 this is the complication we have to tell our daughters and our colleagues we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the a to reach for the
  to sit at the table  and we have to do it in a world where for them there are sacrifices they will make for that even though for their brothers there are not 
 the saddest thing about all of this is that it 's really hard to remember this and i 'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me but i think important  
 i gave this talk at facebook not so long ago
 to about one hundred employees and a couple hours later there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk
  she wanted to talk to me  i said okay and she sat down and we talked and she said i learned something today i learned that i need to keep my hand up 
 what do you mean she said you 're giving this talk and you said you would take two more questions 
 i had my hand up with many other people and you took two more questions i put my hand down  and i noticed all the women did the same and then you
  only from the men 
 and i thought to myself wow  if it 's me who cares about this obviously giving this talk and
 during this talk i can 't even notice
 that the men 's hands are still raised and the women 's hands are still raised  how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations
 at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women we 've got to get women to sit at the table
 number two 
 make your partner a real partner i 've become convinced that we 've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home the data shows this very clearly
  if a woman and a man work full time
 and have a child  the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does  and the woman does three times the amount of childcare
 the man does so she 's got three jobs or two jobs and he 's got one who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more 
 the causes of this are really complicated and i don 't have time to go into them and i don 't think sunday football watching and general laziness is the cause  
 i think the cause is more complicated  i think as a society
  we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls  
 i know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers and it 's hard  
 when i go to the mommy and me stuff and i see the father there i notice that the other mommies don 't play with him  
 and that 's a problem  because we have to make it as important a job because it 's the hardest job in the world
  studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility
 also have half the divorce rate  and if that wasn 't good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more
 how shall i say this on this stage they know each other more in the biblical sense as well 
 message number three don 't leave before you leave
 i think there 's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking and i see this all the time
 with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving 
 here 's what happens we 're all busy everyone 's busy a woman 's busy  and she starts thinking about having a child 
 and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child she starts thinking about making room for that child how am i going to fit
  this into everything else i 'm doing and literally from that moment 
 she doesn 't raise her hand anymore  she doesn 't look for a promotion she doesn 't take on the new project she doesn 't say me i want to do that she starts leaning back  
 the problem is that let 's say she got pregnant that day that day nine months of pregnancy three months of maternity leave six months to catch your breath
  years more often and as i 've seen it women start thinking about this way earlier when they get engaged or married when they start thinking about having a child which can take a long time 
 one woman came to see me about this she looked a little young and i said so
 are you and your husband thinking about having a baby and she said oh no i 'm not married she
  you 're thinking about this just way too early but the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back  
 everyone who 's been through this and i 'm here to tell you once you have a child at home your job better be really good to go back because it 's hard to leave that kid at home 
 your job needs to be challenging it needs to be rewarding
  you need to feel like you 're making a difference  
 and if two years ago you didn 't take a promotion and some guy next to you did 
 if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities you 're going to be bored
 because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal 
 don 't leave before you leave stay in keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to
  to take a break for a child and then make your decisions don 't make decisions too far in advance  particularly ones you 're not even conscious you 're making 
 my generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top they 're just not moving we are not going to get to where fifty percent of the population
 in my generation there will not be fifty percent of [ women ] at the top of any industry  but i 'm hopeful that future generations can i think a
  world where half of our countries
 and our companies were run by women  would be a better world  it 's not just because people would know where the women 's bathrooms are even though
 that would be very helpful  i think it would be a better world  
 i have two children i have a five year old son and a two year old daughter  
 i want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home 
 and i want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed but to be liked for her accomplishments  thank you
