  proved to be the ultimate medium for
  complete control
 of everything the audience can see moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques
 to further their deceptions

 and they
  even today 's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen 
 and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect 
 now imaginative people have been having fun with this
 for over four hundred years giambattista della porta a neapolitan scholar in the
  natural world and saw how it could be manipulated  
 playing with the world and our perception of it really is the essence of visual effects  so digging deeper into this with the science and technology council of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences
 reveals some truth behind the trickery visual effects are
  based on the principles of all illusions  assumption things are as we know them  
 presumption 
 things will behave as we expect and context in reality 
 our knowledge of the world as we know it such as scale  
 now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession  which is never betray the
  illusion 
 and that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection  
 so from the hand cranked
 jump cut early days of cinema to last sunday 's oscar winner what follows are some steps and
 a few repeats
  first to realize that films had the power to capture dreams
  no truncal ataxia that 's
 the
 the
  seems to me
  life
