  world wide web is celebrating this month its 25th anniversary  so
 i 've got a question for you  let 's talk about the
  talk about the state let 's talk about what sort of a web
 we want  so  twenty five years ago then i was working at cern  i got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project i
 wrote the code
 i was i suppose the first user there was a lot of
 concern that people didn 't want to pick it up because it would be too complicated a lot of persuasion a lot of wonderful collaboration with other people and bit by bit it worked
  took off it was pretty cool  and in fact a few years later in two thousand 
 percent of the world population
 were using the world wide web in two thousand and seven seven years later seventeen percent in two thousand and eight we formed the world wide web foundation partly to look at that and worry
 worry about
  and now here we are in two thousand and fourteen and forty percent of the world are using
 the world wide web  and counting obviously it 's increasing i want you to think about both sides
 of that okay obviously to anybody here at ted the first question you ask is what can we do
 to get the other sixty percent on board as quickly as possible lots of important things obviously it 's going to be around mobile but also i want you to think about the forty percent because if you 're sitting there yourself sort of
 you don 't remember things anymore you just look them up then
 you may feel that it 's been a success and we can all sit back but in fact 
 yeah it 's been a success there 's lots of things  khan academy for crying out loud there 's wikipedia there 's a huge number of free
  that you can read online lots of wonderful things for education 
 things in many areas online commerce has in some cases completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether made types of commerce available which weren 't available at all before
 commerce has been almost universally affected
  government not universally affected  but very affected and on a
 good day  lots of open data lots of e government
  which are visible happening on the web  also lots of things which are less visible the healthcare late at night when they 're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have when they just talk
 across the internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country  those sorts of things are
 not they 're not out there and in fact they 've acquired a certain amount of privacy
  cannot assume that part of the web  part of the deal with the web is when i use the web it 's just a transparent  neutral medium
  i can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening  
 without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it 'll be done by people who may abuse
  so in fact something we realized we can 't just use the web we have to worry about
 what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing is it in fact of a quality that we need we revel in the fact that
 we have this wonderful free speech we can tweet and oh lots and lots of people can see our tweets except when they can 't except when
  twitter is blocked from their country  
 or
 in some way the way we try to express ourselves has put some information about the state of ourselves the state of the country we live in which isn 't available to anybody else  so
 we must protest
 and make sure that censorship is cut down that the web is opened up where there is censorship 
 we love the fact that the web is open it allows us to talk anybody can talk to anybody it doesn 't matter who we are and then we join these big
  social networking
 companies which are in fact
 effectively built as silos so that it 's much easier to talk to somebody in the same social network than it is to talk to somebody in a different one so in fact we 're
 sometimes limiting ourselves and we also have if you 've read the book about the filter bubble the filter bubble phenomenon is that
 we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like
 so we love it when we 're bathed in what things we like to click on 
 and so the machine automatically feeds us the stuff that we like and we end up with this  rose colored spectacles view of the world
 called a filter bubble  so here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have what sort of web
  i want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces as some countries have been suggesting they should do in reaction to recent surveillance
 i want a web which has got 
 for example is a really good basis for democracy  i want a web where
 i can use healthcare with privacy and where there 's a lot of health data clinical data is available to scientists to do research  
 i want a web where the other
 sixty percent get on board as fast as possible  i want
 a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation that when something nasty happens some disaster strikes that we can respond by building stuff to to respond to it very quickly  
 so this is just some of the things that i want  from a big list  obviously it 's longer you have your list  i want us to use this
 about what sort of a web we want you can go to 
  find some links  there are lots of sites where people have started to put together a magna carta a bill of rights for the web  how about we do that how about we decide these
 are in a way  becoming fundamental rights the right to communicate with whom
  what would be on your list for that magna carta let 's crowdsource a magna carta
 for
 the web  let 's do that this year let 's use the energy from the 25th anniversary to crowdsource
 a magna carta to the web
