  i love to collect things  ever since i was a kid i 've had massive collections of random stuff everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world
 to insects that i 've captured and put in jars
  's no secret because i like collecting things that i love the natural history museum and the collections of animals at the natural history museum in dioramas 
 these to me are like living sculptures right  that you can go and look at and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal 's life  
 so i was thinking about my own life  and how i 'd like to memorialize my life you know for the ages  
 and also the lives of my friends  but
 the problem with this is that my friends aren 't quite keen on the idea of me
  so instead i turned to video and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time  so what i did was i filmed six of my friends
 and then using video mapping and video projection i created a video sculpture  which was these six friends projected into jars 
 so now i have this collection of my friends i can take around with me whenever i go and this is called animalia chordata from the latin nomenclature for
  being classification system  so this piece memorializes my friends in these jars  and they actually move around 
 laughter so this is interesting to me but it lacked a certain human element it
 's a digital sculpture so i wanted to add an interaction system so what i did was i added a proximity sensor  so that when you get close to the people in jars  they react to you in different ways you know 
 just like people on the street when
  get too close to them  some people reacted in terror others reacted in asking you for help  and some people hide from you 
 so this was really interesting to me this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life  and also adding interactivity to sculpture
  so over the next year  i documented forty of my other
 friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as garden which is literally a garden of humanity  
 but something about the first piece the animali chordata piece kept coming back to me this idea of interaction with art  and i really liked the idea of people being able to interact and also being challenged by interacting with art  
 so i wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something and the way i did this was actually by projecting a 1950s housewife into a blender 
 this is a piece called blend  and what it does is it actually makes you
  implicit in the work of art you may never experience the entire thing yourself 
 you can walk away you can just watch as this as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you or you can actually choose to interact with it
  so if you do choose to interact with the with the piece 
 and you press the blender button it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment 
 by doing that you are now part of my piece you like the people that are trapped in my work
 have become part of my work as well 
 but 
 but
 this seems a bit unfair right  i put my friends in jars i put this this character this sort of endangered species character in a blender
  but i 'd never done anything about myself i 'd never really memorialized myself so i decided to create a piece which is a self portrait piece this is sort of a self portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called a point just passed in which i project myself on top of a time card punch clock  
 and it 's up to you if you want to choose to punch that punch card clock  you actually age me  
 so i start as a baby  
 and then if you punch the clock  you 'll actually transform the baby into a toddler
  and then from a toddler i 'm transformed into a teenager  from a teenager i 'm transformed into my current self  from my current self i 'm turned into a middle aged man  
 and then from there into an elderly man  
 and if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day  the piece goes black and is not to be
  reset until the next day  
 so in doing so you 're erasing time 
 you 're actually implicit in this work and you 're erasing my life  
 so i like this about interactive video sculpture  that you can actually interact with it that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves  and hopefully one day 
 i 'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars
