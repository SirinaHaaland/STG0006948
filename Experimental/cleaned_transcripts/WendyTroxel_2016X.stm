  it 's six o 'clock in the morning  pitch black outside
 my 14 year old son is fast asleep in his bed  sleeping the reckless  deep sleep of a teenager  
 i flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake because i know that like ripping off
 band aid it 's better to get it over with quickly 
 i have a friend who yells fire just to rouse her sleeping teen 
 and another who got so fed up that she had to dump cold water on her son 's head just to get him out of bed
  sound brutal  but perhaps familiar  
 every morning i ask myself
  i
 knowing what i know and doing what i do for a living
 be doing this to my own son you see  i 'm a sleep researcher 
 laughter so i know far too much about sleep  and the consequences of sleep loss 
 i know that i 'm depriving my son of the sleep he desperately needs
 as a rapidly growing teenager  i also
  know that by waking him up hours before his natural biological clock tells him he 's ready  i 'm literally robbing him of his dreams
 the type of sleep most associated with learning  memory consolidation and emotional processing  
 but it 's not just my kid that 's being deprived of
  sleep deprivation among american teenagers is an epidemic  
 only about one in ten gets the eight to ten hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians  
 now if you 're thinking to yourself phew we 're doing good my kid 's getting eight hours 
 remember eight hours is the minimum recommendation  you 're barely passing 
 eight hours is kind of like getting a c on your report card
 there are many factors contributing to this epidemic  but a major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need
 is actually a matter of public policy  not hormones  social lives
 or snapchat across the country  many schools are starting
  despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that middle and high school start no earlier than eight 30am 
 these early start policies have a direct effect on how much
 or really how little sleep american teenagers are getting they 're also pitting teenagers
 and their parents in a fundamentally unwinnable fight against their own bodies
 around the time of puberty teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock  which determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most sleepy 
 this is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin teenagers ' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around
  which is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children 
 this means that waking a teenager up at 6am is the biological equivalent of waking an adult up at 
  the unfortunate days when i have to wake up at 4am 
 i 'm a zombie  functionally useless i can 't think straight  i 'm irritable and i probably shouldn 't be driving a car
  car 
 but this is how many american teenagers feel every single school day 
 in fact many of the shall we say  
 unpleasant characteristics that we chalk up to being a teenager moodiness  irritability laziness depression
 could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation for many teens battling chronic sleep loss their
  to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine in the form of venti frappuccinos or energy drinks and shots 
 so essentially we 've got an entire population
 of tired but wired youth  
 advocates of sleep friendly start times know that adolescence is a period of dramatic brain
  development  particularly in the parts of the brain that are responsible for those higher order thinking processes  including reasoning
 and good judgment in other words the very type of brain activity that 's responsible for reining in those impulsive
 and often risky behaviors that are so characteristic of adolescence
 and that are so terrifying to us parents of
  teenagers they know that like the rest of us when teenagers don 't get the sleep they need their brains their bodies and behaviors suffer
 with both immediate and lasting effects  they can 't concentrate their attention plummets
 and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic
 but the consequences of teen sleep loss go well beyond the classroom
 sadly contributing to many of the mental health problems that skyrocket during adolescence 
 including substance use  depression and suicide 
 in our work with teens from la unified school district 
 we found that teens with sleep problems were fifty five percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month 
 in another study with over thirty
  thousand high school students  they found that for each hour of lost sleep  
 there was a thirty eight percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless 
 and a fifty eight percent increase in teen suicide attempts  
 and if that 's not enough teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of physical health problems that plague our country
 obesity  heart disease and diabetes  
 then there 's the risk of putting a sleep deprived teen with a newly minted driver 's license  behind the wheel  
 studies have shown that getting five hours or less of sleep per night
 is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol
  start times and researchers in this area have produced tremendous science showing the tremendous benefits of later start times 
 the findings are unequivocal and as a sleep scientist  i rarely get to speak with that kind of
  teens from districts with later start times get more sleep to the naysayers who may think that if schools start later teens will just stay up later 
 the truth is their bedtimes stay the same but their wake up times get extended  resulting in more sleep 
 they 're more likely to show up for school school absences dropped by twenty five percent in one district  and they 're less likely to drop out 
 not surprisingly
  they do better academically  so this has real implications for reducing the achievement gap  
 standardized test scores in math and reading go up by two to three percentage points 
 that 's as powerful as reducing class sizes by  one third fewer students 
 or replacing a so so teacher in the classroom
 with a truly outstanding one
  their mental and physical health improves  and even their families are happier  
 i mean who wouldn 't enjoy a little more pleasantness from our teens and a little less crankiness 
 even their communities are safer because car crash rates go down
 a seventy percent reduction in one district
  given these tremendous benefits you might think well this is a no brainer right  
 so why have we as a society failed to heed this call 
 often the argument against later start times goes something like this 
 why should we delay start times for teenagers we need to toughen them up so they 're ready for the real world but that 's like saying
  to the parent of a two year old don 't let johnny nap or he won 't be ready for kindergarten 
 delaying start times also presents many logistical challenges not just for students and their families but for communities as a whole  
 updating bus routes increased transportation costs  impact on sports  care before or after school these
 are are the same concerns that come up in district after district
  time and again around the country as school start times are debated  
 and they 're legitimate concerns 
 but these are problems we have to work through  
 they are not valid excuses for failing to do the right thing for our children  
 which is to start middle and high schools no earlier
  and in districts around the country big and small who have made this change  they found that these fears are often unfounded
 and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits
 for student health and performance and our collective public safety 
 so tomorrow morning when coincidentally we get to set our clocks back by an hour and you get that
  delicious extra hour of sleep 
 and the day seems a little longer  and a little more full of hope 
 think about the tremendous power of sleep and think about what a gift it would be for our children
 to be able to wake up naturally in harmony with their own biology
