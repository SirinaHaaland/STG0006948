  the first of a series that 's going to be done in response to the current political upheaval i don 't know
 about you i 've become quite concerned about the growing divisiveness in this country and in the world
 no one 's listening to each other right 
 they aren 't i mean it feels like we need a different kind of conversation 
 one that 's based on i don 't know on reason listening on understanding 
 on a broader context 
 that 's at least what we 're going to try in these ted dialogues starting
  we couldn 't have anyone with us who i 'd be more excited to kick this off this is a mind right here that thinks pretty much like no one else on the planet
  i could not put it down  the way that he tells the story of mankind through big ideas that really make you think differently
 it 's kind of amazing and here 's the follow up which i think is is being published in the us next week ynh yeah next week ca homo deus now this is the history of the
  had a chance to read it  it 's
 extremely dramatic  and i daresay  for some people  quite alarming  it 's a must read and
 honestly we couldn 't have someone better to help
 make sense of what on earth is happening in the world right now so a warm welcome please to
  be joined by our friends on facebook and around the web hello facebook 
 and all of you as i start asking questions of yuval come up with your own questions and not necessarily about the political scandal du jour but about the the broader understanding
  there 's a new president in power and shock waves rippling around the world  what on earth is happening ynh 
 i think the basic thing that happened is that we have lost our story humans think in stories  and we
  to make sense of the world by telling stories 
 and for the last few decades we had a very simple and very attractive story about what 's happening in the world  and the story said
 that  oh what 's happening is that the economy is being globalized politics is being liberalized and the combination of the two will create paradise on earth  
 and we just need to keep on globalizing the economy and liberalizing the political system and everything will be wonderful 
 is the moment when
 a very large segment even of the western world  stopped believing in this story  for good or bad reasons it doesn 't matter people stopped believing in the story  
 and when you don 't have a story  you don 't understand what 's happening 
 ca part of you believes that that story was actually a very effective story  
  to some measurements we are now in the best time ever for humankind 
 today for the first time in history more people die from eating too much than from eating too little which is an amazing achievement 
 laughter also for the first time in history more people die from old age than from infectious
  violence is also down for the first time in history more people commit suicide than are killed by crime and terrorism and war put together
  statistically  you are your own worst enemy at least of all the people in the world you are most likely to be killed by yourself 
 which is again very good
  to the level of violence that we saw in previous eras ca but this process of connecting the world ended up with a large group of people kind of feeling left out
 and they 've reacted and so we have this bombshell this bombshell that 's sort of ripping through the whole
 system i mean  what do you make of of what 's happened it feels like the old
 way that people thought of politics the left right divide has been blown up and replaced how should we think
  this the old 
  political model of left versus right is now largely irrelevant  
 and the real divide today is between global and national global or local
  and you see it  again all over the world that this is now the main struggle  we probably need
 completely new political models and completely new ways of thinking
  about politics  in essence what you can say is that we now have
 global ecology we have a global economy but we have national politics  and this doesn 't work together this makes the political system ineffective because it has 
  no control over the forces that shape our life and you have basically two solutions to this imbalance either de globalize the
  and turn it back into a national economy or globalize the political system ca so
 some i guess many liberals out there view trump
 and his his
 government as kind of irredeemably bad just awful in every
  political philosophy in there that is at least worth understanding how would you articulate that that philosophy is it just the philosophy of nationalism ynh i think
 the underlying
 feeling or idea is that
 the political system something is broken there  it doesn 't empower
 the ordinary person anymore  it doesn 't care so much about the ordinary person anymore
  and i think this
 diagnosis of the political disease is correct 
 with regard to the answers i am far less certain  i think what we are seeing is the immediate human reaction if something doesn 't work let 's go back  
 and you see it all over the world that people
 almost nobody in the political system today has any
  almost everywhere you see retrograde vision let 's make america great again like it was great i don 't know in the ' 50s in the ' 80s sometime let 's go back there and you go to russia
 a hundred years after lenin putin 's vision for the future is basically ah let 's go back to the tsarist empire and
  i come from the hottest political vision of the present is let 's build the temple again so let 's go back two thousand years
 backwards  so people are thinking
 sometime in the past we 've lost it and sometimes in the past it 's like you 've lost your way in the city  
 and you say ok let 's go back to the point where i felt secure and start again  i don 't think this can work  
  is a very appealing
 slogan in many ways patriotism is is in many ways a very noble thing it 's played a role in in promoting cooperation among large numbers of people why couldn 't you have a world organized
 in countries all of which put themselves first 
 ynh for many centuries even thousands of years patriotism worked quite well
 of course it led to wars an so forth but we shouldn 't focus too much on the bad  there are also many many positive things about patriotism  and the ability to have a
 large number of people care about each other sympathize with one another and come together for collective action
  if you go back to the first nations so thousands of years ago  the people who lived along
  the yellow river in china
 it
 was many many different tribes and they all depended on the river for survival and for prosperity but all of them also suffered from periodical 
  floods and periodical droughts and no tribe could really do anything about it  because each of them controlled just a tiny section of the river 
  tribes coalesced together to form the chinese nation which controlled the entire yellow river and had the ability
 to bring hundreds of thousands of people together to build dams and canals and and regulate the river
 and prevent the worst floods and droughts and raise the level of prosperity for everybody  and this worked in many places around the world
 but in the 21st century  
 technology is changing all that in a fundamental way  we are now living all people in the world are living alongside the same cyber river 
 and no single nation
 can regulate this river by itself we are all living
  which is threatened by our own actions  and if you don 't have some kind of global cooperation nationalism is just not on the right level 
 to tackle the problems whether it 's climate change or whether it 's technological disruption ca 
  most today no longer take place on a national scale but on a global scale ynh exactly all the major problems of the world today are global
 in essence  and they cannot be solved unless through some kind of global cooperation it 's not just climate change  which is like the most obvious example
  i think more in terms of technological disruption  if you think about for example artificial intelligence
  over the next twenty thirty years pushing hundreds of millions of people out of the job market this is a problem on a global level it will disrupt the economy of all the countries 
 and similarly if you think about say bioengineering and people being afraid
  genetic engineering research in humans  it won 't help
 if just a single country let 's say the us outlaws all genetic experiments in humans 
 but china or north korea continues to do it  
 so the us cannot solve it by itself  and very quickly  the pressure on the us to do the same will be immense because we are talking
  if somebody else is doing it  i can 't allow myself to remain behind the only way to
 have regulations  effective regulations on things like genetic engineering  is to have global regulations  if you just have national regulations nobody would like to stay behind ca 
 so this is really
  seems to me that this may be one key to provoking at least a constructive conversation between the different sides here because
 i think everyone can agree that the start point of a lot of the anger that 's propelled us to where we are is because of the legitimate concerns about job loss work is gone a traditional way of life
  has has gone and it 's no wonder that people are furious about that and in general
  global elites for doing this to them without asking their permission and that seems like a legitimate complaint but what i hear you saying is that so a key question is what is the real cause of job loss  both now and going forward 
 to the extent that it 's about
 globalism then the right response yes is to shut down
 borders and keep people out and change trade agreements and so forth  but you 're saying i think that actually the
  bigger cause of of job loss is is not going to be that at all it 's going to originate in technological questions 
 and we have no chance of solving that unless we we operate as a connected world ynh yeah i think that 
 i don 't know about the present but looking to the future 
 it 's not the mexicans or chinese who will take the jobs from the people in pennsylvania  it 's the robots and algorithms  so unless you plan to build
 a big wall on the border of california the wall on the border with mexico is going to be very ineffective
  and i was struck when i watched the debates before the election  i was struck that
 certainly trump did not even attempt to frighten people by saying the robots will take your jobs now even if it 's not true
 could have been an extremely effective way of frightening people and galvanizing people the robots will take your jobs and nobody used that line  and
 it it made me afraid because it meant that
 no matter what happens in universities and laboratories and there there is already an intense debate about it  but in the mainstream political system
 and among the general public people are just
 unaware
 that
 there could be an immense technological disruption not in two hundred years  but in ten twenty thirty years
 and we have to do something about it now partly because
 most of what we teach children today in school or in college is going to be completely irrelevant to the job market of
  it 's not something we 'll need to think about in two thousand and forty we need to think today what to teach the young people
  in a way that 's worse for everyone so one of the examples you give in sapiens is just the whole agricultural revolution
  which for an actual person tilling the fields they just picked up a 12 hour backbreaking workday instead of
 six hours in the jungle and a much more interesting
  are we at another possible phase change here where we kind of sleepwalk into a future that none of us actually wants ynh yes very much so 
 during the agricultural revolution  what happened is that immense technological and economic revolution empowered the human collective  
 but when you look at actual individual
  the life of a tiny elite became much better and the lives of the majority of people became considerably worse  
 and this can happen again  in the 21st century  no doubt the new technologies will empower the human collective
  but we may end up again with a tiny elite
 reaping all the benefits taking all the fruits  and the masses of the population
  finding themselves
 worse than they were before certainly much worse than this tiny elite ca and those elites might not even be human elites they might be
 cyborgs or ynh yeah they could be enhanced super humans they could be cyborgs they could be completely nonorganic elites  they could even be non conscious algorithms
  what we see now in the world is authority shifting away from humans to algorithms more and more decisions about
 personal lives about economic matters about political matters are actually being taken by algorithms  if you
 ask the bank for a loan  chances are your fate is decided by an algorithm not by a human being  and the general impression is that
 maybe homo sapiens just lost it
  things are changing so fast that this thing that evolved on the african savanna tens of thousands of years ago to cope with a particular environment a particular volume of information and data
 it just can 't handle the realities of the 21st century  and the only thing that
  more and more authority is shifting from us to the algorithms ca so we 're in new york city for the first of a series of ted dialogues with
 yuval harari  and
 there 's a facebook live audience out there we 're excited to have you with us we 'll start coming to some of your questions and questions of people in the room in just a few minutes so have those
 yuval  if you 're going to make the argument that we need to get past nationalism because of the coming technological
 danger in a way
 presented by so much of what 's happening we 've got to have a global conversation about this trouble is it 's hard to get people really believing that i don 't know  ai really is an imminent threat and so forth the things that people 
  people at least care about much more much more immediately perhaps is
 climate change perhaps other issues like refugees nuclear weapons and so forth  
 would you argue that where we are right now that somehow those issues need to be dialed up
  in a way your most powerful argument you can 't actually use
 to make this case ynh yeah i think with climate change  
 at first sight it 's quite surprising that there is a very close correlation between nationalism and climate change  i mean  almost always the people who deny climate change are nationalists
  and at first sight you think why what 's the connection why don 't you have socialists denying climate change  but then when you think about it it 's obvious
 because nationalism has no solution to climate change  if you want to be a nationalist in the 21st century
  you have to deny the problem  if you accept the reality of the problem  then you must accept that yes  there is still room in the world for patriotism
  there is still room in the world for having special loyalties and obligations towards your own people  towards your own country  i don 't think anybody is really thinking of abolishing that  but
 in order to confront climate change  we need
 additional loyalties and commitments to a level beyond the nation  and that should not be impossible because people can have several layers of loyalty  you can be loyal to your
  family
 and to your community and to your nation  so why can 't you also be loyal to humankind as a whole of course there are occasions when it becomes difficult
 what to put first but you know life is difficult handle it laughter
 ca  ok so i would love to get some questions from the audience here we 've got a microphone here speak
 into it and facebook get them coming too howard morgan one of the things that has clearly
 made a huge difference in this country and other countries is the income distribution inequality the dramatic
 change in income distribution in the us from what it was fifty years ago and around the world is 
  gets at a lot of the underlying causes 
 so far i haven 't heard a very good idea about what to do about it again  partly because most ideas remain on the national level 
  and the problem is global  i mean one idea that we hear quite a lot about now is universal basic income  
  is most people when they speak about universal basic income  they actually mean national basic income
 but the problem is global let 's say that you have
 ai and 3d printers taking away millions of jobs in bangladesh from all the people who make my shirts and my my shoes  
 so what 's going to happen the
  us government will
 levy taxes on google and apple in california  and use that to pay basic income to unemployed bangladeshis  
 if you believe that you can just as well believe that santa claus will come and solve the problem
  so unless we have really universal and not national basic income  the deep problems are not going to go
  and also it 's not clear what basic is 
 because what are basic human needs a thousand years ago  just food and shelter was enough but today people will say education is a basic human need it should be part of 
  the package but how much six years  twelve years  phd 
  human life to one hundred and twenty i don 't know 
 will this be part of the basket of basic income or not it 's a very difficult problem  because in a world where people lose 
  their ability to to be employed the only thing they are going to get is this basic income  
 there 's a question here from facebook from lisa larson how does nationalism in the us now compare to that between world war i and world war ii in the last century ynh 
 well the good news 
 with regard to the dangers of nationalism we are in a much better position than a century ago a century ago one thousand nine hundred and
  europeans were killing each other by the millions 
 in two thousand and sixteen with brexit as far as i remember a single person lost their life an mp who was murdered by some extremist 
  just a single person  i mean if brexit was about british independence this is the most peaceful war of independence in human history  
 brexit so in the 18th century  
 if scotland wanted and the scots wanted several times to to break out of the control of london 
 the reaction of the government in london was to send an army up north to burn down edinburgh and massacre the highland tribes
 my guess is that if in two thousand and eighteen
  the scots vote for independence  the london government will not send an army up north to burn down edinburgh 
 very few people are now willing to kill or be killed
 for scottish or for british independence  so for all the talk of the rise of
  today is far far smaller than it was a century ago ca although some people now  you hear
 publicly worrying about whether that might be shifting
 that there could actually be outbreaks of violence in in the us depending on how things turn out  should we be worried about that or do you really think things
 we are not back in the first world war yet  but on the other hand don 't be complacent
  we reached from one thousand nine hundred and seventeen to two thousand and seventeen not by some divine miracle but simply by human decisions  and if 
  we now start making the wrong decisions we could be back in an analogous situation to one thousand nine hundred and seventeen
  one of the things i know as a historian is that you should never underestimate human stupidity it
 's one of the most powerful forces in history human stupidity and human violence humans do such crazy things for no obvious reason 
 but again at the same time another very powerful force in human history is human
 we have with us here moral psychologist jonathan haidt who i think has has a question jonathan haidt
 thanks yuval  
 so you seem to be a fan of global governance  but when you look at the map of the world from transparency international which rates the level of corruption of political institutions it 's a vast sea of red with little bits of yellow here and there for those with good institutions
 so if we were to have some kind of global governance  what makes you think
  it would end up being more like denmark rather than more like russia or honduras and aren 't there alternatives such as we did with cfcs there are ways to solve global problems with national governments what would world government actually look like and why do you think it would work ynh well
 i don 't know what it would look like  nobody still has a
  the main reason we need it is because many of these issues are lose lose situations 
 when you have a win win situation like trade both sides can benefit from a trade agreement 
 then this is something you can work out without some kind of global government national governments each have an interest in doing it  
 but when you have a lose lose situation like with climate
  it 's much more difficult without some
 overarching authority real authority now how to get there and what would it look like i don 't know
  and certainly there is no obvious reason to think that it would look like denmark or that it would be a democracy 
 most likely it wouldn 't we don 't have
 workable democratic models for a global government
  so maybe it would look more like ancient china than like modern denmark  but still given the
 dangers that we are facing 
 i think the imperative of having some kind of real ability to force through difficult decisions on the global level
 is more important than almost anything else
  from facebook here and then we 'll get the mic to andrew so kat hebron on facebook
  calling in from vail how would developed nations manage the millions of climate migrants
  basis  one nation can shut its doors  but maybe that stores up problems for the future ynh yes i mean
 it 's another very good case especially because it 's so much easier to migrate today than it was in the middle ages or in ancient times 
 ca yuval there 's a belief among
  many technologists certainly that political concerns are kind of overblown that actually political leaders don 't have that much influence in the world that the real
 determination of humanity at this point is by science by invention by companies 
 by many things other than political leaders and it 's actually very hard for leaders to do much so we 're actually worrying about nothing here 
  it should be emphasized that it 's true that political leaders ' ability to do good is very limited but their ability to do harm is unlimited  there is a basic imbalance here
  you can still press the button and blow everybody up you have that kind of ability but if you want for example  to reduce inequality  that 's very very difficult  
 but to start a war you can still do so very easily
  system today which is very frustrating where you cannot do a lot of good but you can still do a lot of harm  
 and this makes the political system still a very big concern ca 
 so as you look at what 's happening today  and putting your historian 's hat on do you look back in history at moments when things were going just fine and an individual leader
 really took the world or their country backwards
 ynh there are quite a few examples but i should emphasize it 's never an individual leader  i mean somebody put him there 
 and somebody allowed him to continue to be there  so it 's never really just the fault of a single individual 
 there are a lot of people behind every such individual 
 can we have the
  you 've talked a lot about the global versus the national but increasingly it seems to me the world situation is in the hands of identity groups  we look at people within the united states
  who have been recruited by isis we look at these other groups which have formed which go outside of national bounds but still represent significant authorities how are they to be integrated into the system and how is a diverse set of identities to be made
  coherent under either national or global leadership ynh 
 well the problem of such diverse identities is a problem from nationalism as well
  nationalism believes in a single monolithic identity and exclusive or at least more extreme versions of nationalism believe in an exclusive loyalty to a single identity  and therefore nationalism has had a lot of problems
 with people wanting to divide their identities
 between various groups  so it 's not just a problem say for a global
 vision  and i think again history shows that
 you shouldn 't necessarily think in such exclusive terms
  if you think that there is just a single identity for a person i am just x that 's it  i can 't be several things i can be just that 
 that 's the start of the problem
  you have religions you have nations that sometimes demand exclusive loyalty  
 but it 's not the only option there are many religions and many nations that enable you to have diverse identities at the same time ca 
  is one explanation of what 's happened in the last year that
 that a group of people have got fed up with  if you like the liberal elites for want of a better term  
 obsessing over many many different identities and them feeling but what about my identity i am being completely ignored here and by the way i thought i was the majority 
 and that that 's actually sparked a lot of the anger
  problematic because identity is always based on fictional stories that sooner or later collide with reality  
 almost all identities  i mean beyond the level of the basic community of a few dozen people are based on a fictional story they are not the truth 
  they are not the reality  it 's just a story that people invent and tell one another and start believing
  and therefore
 all identities are extremely unstable 
 they are not a biological reality  sometimes nationalists for example think that the nation is a biological entity  it 's made of the combination of soil and blood  creates the nation  
 but this is just a fictional story ca
 soil and blood kind of makes a gooey mess
  it does and also it messes with your mind when you think too much that i am a combination of soil and blood  if you look from a biological perspective
  obviously none of the nations that exist today existed five thousand years ago  homo sapiens is a social animal that 's for
  for millions of years  homo sapiens and our hominid ancestors lived in small communities of a few dozen individuals everybody knew everybody 
  else whereas modern nations are imagined communities in the sense that i don 't even know all these people i come from a relatively small nation israel 
  exist here ca but in terms of this identity this group who feel left out and
 perhaps have work taken away  i mean in
 you actually speak of of this group in one sense expanding that so many people may have their jobs taken away by technology in
  we could end up with
 a really large i think you call it a useless class a class where traditionally as viewed by the economy these people have no use ynh 
 yes ca how likely a possibility is that is that something we should be terrified about and
 can we address it in any way ynh we should think about it very carefully i mean nobody really knows
 what the job market
  there is a chance many new jobs will appear  but it 's not certain  and even if new jobs do appear  it won 't necessarily be easy for a 50 year old 
 unemployed truck driver made made unemployed by self driving vehicles it won 't be easy for
  if you look at the trajectory of the industrial revolution  when machines replaced humans in one type of work the solution usually came from 
 work in new new lines of business so you didn 't need any more agricultural workers  so people moved to working in low skill industrial
 jobs  and when this was taken away by more and more machines people moved to
 low skill service jobs 
 now when people say there will be new jobs in the future that humans can do better than ai that humans can do better than robots they usually think about high skill jobs like software engineers designing virtual worlds  
 now  
 i don 't see how an unemployed cashier from
  reinvents herself or himself at fifty as a designer of virtual worlds  and certainly i don 't see how the millions of unemployed bangladeshi textile workers
 will be able to do that  
 i mean  if they are going to do it  we need to start teaching the bangladeshis today how to be software designers  and we are not doing it  so what will they do in twenty years
  there 's a question here
  i think that
  whether it 's climate change or whether it 's technological
  will take the jobs from
  thousands of years
  all over the world
  the problem is
  what 's happening in the world
