  i told my parents i was gay the first thing they said to me was we 're bringing you back to taiwan 
 in their minds my sexual orientation was america 's
  the west had corrupted me with divergent ideas and if only my parents had never left taiwan  this would not have happened to their only daughter  
 in truth i wondered if they were right of course there are gay people in asia just as there are gay people in every part of the world 
 but is the idea of living an out life in the i 'm gay this is my spouse and we 're proud of our lives
  kind of way
 just a western idea 
 if i had grown up in taiwan  or any place outside of the west would i have found models of happy thriving lgbt people lisa dazols 
 i had similar notions as an hiv social worker in san francisco i had met many gay immigrants they told me their stories of persecution in their home countries just for being gay 
 and the reasons
 why they escaped to the us i saw how this had beaten them down 
 after ten years of doing this kind of work i needed better stories for myself  
 i knew the world was far from perfect  but surely not every gay story was tragic jc 
 so as a couple we both had a need to find stories of hope 
 so we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the
  lgbt individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world they would be courageous  resilient  and most of all proud of who they were 
 they would be the kind of person that i aspire to be 
 our plan was to share their stories to the world through film ld there
 was just one problem  we had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience we didn 't even know where to find the
 supergays so we just had to trust that we 'd figure it all out along the way  
 so we picked fifteen countries in asia africa and south america countries outside the west that varied in terms of lgbt rights  we bought a camcorder  ordered a book on how to make a documentary 
 you can learn a lot these days
 and set off on
  one of the first countries that we traveled to was nepal 
 despite widespread poverty a decade long civil war  and now recently a devastating earthquake 
 nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality  
 one of the key figures in the movement is bhumika shrestha 
 a beautiful vibrant transgendered woman bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school
 and getting incarcerated
  because of her gender presentation  
 but in two thousand and seven bhumika and nepal 's lgbt rights organization successfully petitioned the nepali supreme court to protect against lgbt discrimination  here 's
  the decision for the nepal government
 to give
 transgender identity cards and  same sex marriage ld 
 i can appreciate bhumika 's confidence on a daily basis something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don 't fit in
 to people 's strict gender expectations  traveling throughout
  i tended to freak out women in public restrooms they weren 't used to seeing someone like me  i had to come up with a strategy so that i could just pee in peace 
 so anytime i would enter a restroom i would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts 
 and try to be as non threatening as possible  putting out my my hands and saying hello just so that people could hear my feminine voice 
 this all gets pretty exhausting but it 's just who i am  i can 't be anything else
  traveled to india 
 on one hand  india is a hindu society  without a tradition of homophobia  
 on the other hand it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system which rejects anything that threatens the  male female order  
 when we spoke to activists they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality where the women 's status is established
  in society  and in that way the status of lgbt people can be affirmed as well ld there we met prince 
  the world 's first openly gay prince  
 prince  manvendra came out on the oprah winfrey show very internationally his parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal
  we sat down with prince  manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly here he 
 there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society and that
 instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself  whether we are gay we are lesbian  we are transgender bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from
  cannot be won in the court rooms  but in the hearts and the minds of the people jc 
 while getting my hair cut the woman cutting my hair asked me do you have a husband 
 now this was a dreaded question that i got asked a lot by locals while traveling 
 when i explained to her that i was with a woman instead of a man she was incredulous and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents
  reactions
 and whether i was sad that i 'd never be able to have children 
 i told her that there are no limitations to my life and that lisa and i do plan to have a family some day  
 now this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy westerner she couldn 't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her
  i showed her the photos of the supergays that we interviewed in india  
 she recognized prince  manvendra from television and soon i had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me 
 and in that ordinary afternoon  
 i had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country ld 
 from india
 we traveled to east africa a region known for intolerance towards lgbt people 
 in kenya  eighty nine percent of people who come out to their families are disowned homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration  
 in kenya we met the soft spoken david kuria 
 david had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government so he decided to run for senate 
 he became kenya 's first openly gay political candidate
  david wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was but we were worried for his safety because he started to receive death threats
  of who he was even in the face of threats  he stayed authentic ld 
 at the opposite end of the spectrum is argentina 
 argentina 's a country where ninety two percent of the population identifies as catholic yet argentina has lgbt laws that are even more progressive than here in the us  
 in two thousand and ten argentina became the first country in latin america and the
  world to adopt marriage equality
  when we made the visit to my ancestral lands  i wish i could have shown my parents what we found there
  a whole community of young  beautiful chinese lgbt people sure they had their struggles  but they were fighting it out  
 in shanghai  i had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group
 and tell them our story in my broken mandarin chinese
 in taipei each time we got onto the metro  we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands and we learned that asia 's largest lgbt pride event
 happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live if only my parents knew ld by the time we finished our
  we had traveled fifty thousand miles and logged one hundred and twenty hours of video footage  we traveled to fifteen countries and interviewed fifty supergays 
 turns out it wasn 't hard to find them at all jc 
 yes there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality and
 let 's not forget that seventy five countries still criminalize homosexuality today  
 but there are also stories of hope
 and courage in every corner of the
  world  what we ultimately took away from our journey is equality
 is not a western invention ld one
 of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum 
 momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world 
 and momentum as more and more countries find models of
  equality in one another 
 when nepal protected against lgbt discrimination india pushed harder  when argentina embraced marriage equality
 uruguay and brazil followed  when ireland said yes to equality 
 world stopped to notice  when the us supreme court makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of jc 
 as we reviewed our footage  what we realized is that we were watching a love story it
 wasn 't a love story that was expected of me
 but it is one filled with more freedom adventure and love
  i could have ever possibly imagined 
 one year after returning home from our trip  marriage equality came to california and in the end we believe love will win out
