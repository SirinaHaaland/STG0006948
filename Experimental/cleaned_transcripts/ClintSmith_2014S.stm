  speech where he reflects upon the civil rights movement  states in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the
  as a teacher i 've internalized this message 
 every day all around us we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination  
 violence genocide and war 
 in the classroom i challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry 
 we work together to fill those spaces to recognize them to name them to understand that they don 't have to be sources of shame
  in an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences  
 i have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class  which every student signs at the beginning of the year  
 read critically write consciously speak clearly tell your truth and
 i find myself
  thinking a lot about that last point tell your truth and i realized that if i was going to ask my students to speak up  i was going to have to tell my truth
 and be honest with them about the times where i failed to do so 
 so i tell them that growing up as a kid in a catholic family in new orleans during lent
 i was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up  sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to god you understand his sanctity
  given up soda  mcdonald 's french fries french kisses and everything in between  
 but one year  
 i gave up speaking i figured the most valuable thing i could sacrifice was my own voice but it was like i hadn 't realized
 that i had given that up a long time ago  i spent so much of my life
  telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to told myself i wasn 't meant to be anyone 's conscience because i still had to figure out being my own so sometimes
 i just wouldn 't say anything 
 appeasing ignorance with my silence  unaware that validation doesn 't need words to endorse its existence when christian was beat up for being gay i put my hands in my pocket and walked 
  with my head down as if i didn 't even notice i couldn 't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one i had put on my lips when the homeless man on the
  corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing i was more concerned with touching the screen on my apple than actually feeding him one when the woman at the fundraising gala said 
 i 'm so proud of you it must be so hard teaching those poor unintelligent kids i bit my lip because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity we spend so much time
  pay attention to the things they don 't silence
 is the residue of fear  
 it is feeling your flaws
  gut wrench guillotine your tongue  it is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn 't feel safe in your lungs silence is rwandan genocide silence is katrina it is what you hear
  when there aren 't enough body bags left it is the sound after the noose is already tied it is charring it is chains it is privilege
  pain there is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you i will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision i will tell christian that he is a lion a sanctuary of 
  bravery and brilliance  i will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was because sometimes all people want to be is human i will tell that woman that my students can talk about
  like their last name was thoreau  and just because you watched one episode of the wire doesn 't mean you know anything about my kids so this year  instead of giving something up  
 i will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue a stage on the underside of my inhibition 
 because who has to have a soapbox
 when all you 've ever needed
 is your voice
