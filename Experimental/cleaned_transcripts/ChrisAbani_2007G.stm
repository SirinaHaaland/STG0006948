  i just heard the best joke about bond emeruwa i was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago  
 and a nigerian journalist comes and this will only make sense if you 've ever watched a james bond movie
 and a nigerian journalist comes up to
  i 've got a little sheet of paper here mostly because i 'm nigerian and if you if you leave me alone i 'll talk for like two hours i
 just want to say good good afternoon good evening it
 's been an incredible few days it 's downhill from now on 
 i wanted to thank emeka and chris but also most importantly all the invisible people behind ted that you just
  see flitting around the whole place
 that have made sort of this
 this space for
 such a diverse and robust conversation it 's really amazing i
 've been in the audience  i 'm a writer  and i 've been watching people with the slide shows
 and scientists and bankers  and i 've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah
 what have i got to say about all this
  and i was watching jane [ goodall ] yesterday and i thought it was really great and i was watching those incredible slides of the of the chimpanzees and i thought 
 wow what if a chimpanzee could talk you know what would it say my first thought was well you know there 's george bush but then
 i thought why be rude to chimpanzees
 i guess there goes my green card 
 there 's been a lot of talk about narrative in africa  and what 's become increasingly clear to me is that
 we 're talking about news stories about africa we 're not really talking about african narratives and it 's important to make a distinction because if if the news is anything to go by 
 forty percent of americans
 can 't either
 either can 't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance and have a president who despite
 the protest of millions of his citizens even his own congress continues to prosecute a senseless war  so if news is anything to go by 
 the u s is right there with zimbabwe  
  everything we know about america everything americans come to know about being american isn 't from the news i live there we don 't go home at the end of the day
 i really know who i am now because
 the wall street journal says that the stock exchange closed at this many points what we know about how to be who we are comes from stories it comes from the novels the movies 
 the fashion magazines it comes from popular culture in other words it 's the agents of our imagination who really shape who we are and this is important
  in africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings
 of the san people 
 through the sundiata epics of mali to modern contemporary literature if you want to know about africa read our literature and not just things fall apart because that would be like
 saying i 've read ' gone with the wind ' and so i know everything about america
  's very important there 's a poem by jack gilbert called the forgotten dialect of the heart he says 
 when the sumerian tablets were first translated they were thought to be business records  but what if they were poems and psalms 
 my love is like twelve ethiopian goats standing
  in the morning light 
 shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body  
 giraffes are this desire in the dark 
 this is important it 's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity 
 the first igbo bible was translated from english
 in about the 1800s by bishop crowther who was a yoruba
  in cameroon when they tried to translate the the bible into cameroonian patois they chose the igbo version  and i 'm not going to give you the patois translation i 'm going to make it standard english basically it
 ends up as god is on a bicycle with his angels 
 this is good because language complicates things you
 know we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live
 and i find that 's not true the language actually makes the world in which we live
 language is not i mean things don 't have any mutable value by themselves we ascribe them a value 
 and language can 't be understood in its abstraction it can only be understood in the context of story and everything all of this is story  
 and it 's important to remember that because if we don 't then we become ahistorical
  we 've had a lot of a parade of amazing ideas here  but these are not new to africa nigeria got its independence in one thousand nine hundred and sixty  
 the first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in
  here trying to tell this story again  so 
 what it says to me then is that it 's not really the problem isn 't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told the problem really is
 the terms of humanity that we 're willing to bring to complicate every story and that 's really what it 's all about let
 me tell you a nigerian joke well it 's just a joke anyway
 so there 's tom dick and harry and they 're working construction  
 and tom opens up his lunch box and there 's rice in it  and he goes on this rant about twenty years my wife has been packing rice for lunch if she does it again tomorrow i 'm going to throw myself off this building and kill myself 
 and dick and harry repeat this  the next day tom opens his lunchbox there 's rice so he throws himself off and kills himself and tom dick and harry follow  
 and now the inquest you know  tom 's wife
  and dick 's wife are distraught they wished they 'd not packed rice  but harry 's wife is confused 
 because she said you know harry had been packing his own lunch for twenty years 
 this seemingly innocent joke  when i heard it as a child in nigeria was told about igbo yoruba
  with the hausa being harry so what seems like
 an eccentric if tragic joke about harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred 
 my father was educated in cork in the
 university of cork  in the ' 50s in fact every time i read in ireland people get me all mistaken and they say oh this is chris o 'barney from cork but
 he was also in oxford in the ' 50s and yet growing up as a child in nigeria my father used to say to me you must never eat or drink in
  yoruba person 's house
 because they will poison you 
 it makes sense now when i think about it because if you 'd known my father you would 've wanted to poison him too 
 so i was born in
  years and i was growing up in school and the federal government didn 't want us taught about the history of the war because they thought it probably would make us
 generate a new generation of rebels  so i had a very inventive teacher a pakistani muslim who wanted to teach us about this  
 so what he did was to teach us jewish holocaust history and so huddled around books with photographs of people in
  learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people i mean  picture this really picture this a pakistani muslim
 teaching jewish holocaust history
 to young igbo children story is powerful story is fluid and it belongs to nobody  and it should come as no surprise that my first novel at
  taking over nigeria to institute the fourth reich it makes perfect sense 
 and they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country  and they were foiled by a nigerian james bond called coyote williams and a jewish
 a jewish nazi hunter and it happened over four continents and when the book came out i was heralded as africa 's answer to frederick forsyth which is a dubious honor at
  the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt  
 so at eighteen i was bonded off to prison in nigeria  
 i grew up very privileged and it 's important to talk about privilege because we don 't talk about it here 
 a lot of us are very privileged i grew up servants cars televisions all that stuff 
 my story of nigeria growing up was very different from the story i encountered in prison and i had no language for
  it i was completely terrified completely broken  and
 kept trying to find a new language a new way to to make sense of all of this  
 six months after that with no explanation they let me go now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much
  but i mean i grew up with this incredible privilege and not just me
 millions of nigerians grew up with books and libraries in fact we were talking last night about how
 all of the the steamy novels of harold robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in africa than any sex education programs ever had 
  those are gone  we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent the valuable resource of the imagination 
 in the film sometimes in april by raoul peck 
 idris elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised  and he 's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend
 fellow rwandan army officer albeit a tutsi played by fraser james and fraser 's on his knees
  arms tied behind his back and he 's crying  he 's sniveling it 's a pitiful sight and as we watch it  
 we are ashamed and we want to say to idris chop him up shut him up and as idris moves fraser screams
  and it 's not the look of horror and terror on fraser 's face that stops idris or us  
 it 's the look in fraser 's eyes  it 's one that says don 't do this  
 and i 'm not saying this to save myself although this would be nice  i 'm doing it to save you  because if you do this
  you will be lost 
 to be so afraid that you 're
 standing in the face of a death you can 't escape and that you 're soiling yourself and crying  but to say in that moment as fraser says to idris tell my girlfriend i love her 
 in that moment  fraser says 
 i am lost already  but
  this is a redemption we can all aspire to 
 african narratives in the west  they proliferate i really don 't care anymore i 'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves
 how
 as a writer i find that african writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent
 the question is how do i
 balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives
 of wounds and self loathing and this is the difficulty that i face i am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning i
 am asking us to balance
 the idea of our complete vulnerability
 with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible as a young middle class
  launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to to stop the government and i asked millions of people without questioning my right to do so to go up against 
  the government and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed i justified it and i said this is the cost of revolution have i not myself been imprisoned have i not myself been beaten 
  time i was engaged in war  righteous  righteous war excuse me 
 sometimes i can stand before the world and when i say this  transformation is a difficult and slow process
 sometimes i can stand before the world and say my name is chris abani i have been human
  but this is a good thing  
 it 's never going to be easy there are no answers 
 as i was telling rachel from google earth that i had challenged my students in america i said you don 't know anything about africa you 're all idiots 
 and so they said tell me about africa professor abani so i went to google earth and learned about africa and
 the truth be told this is it isn 't it there are no
  most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from and yet we want to make profound statements about it  
 and i think if we can just admit that we 're all trying to approximate the truth of our own communities it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation  
 i want to believe
 that we can be agnostic about this that we can rise above all of this  when i was ten i read james baldwin 's another country and that book broke me
  because i was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time but because the way james wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it 
 here jimmy said here is love all of it 
 the fact that it happens in another country takes you quite by surprise my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in
  he also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential pure identity
