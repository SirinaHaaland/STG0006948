  most of us think of motion as a very visual thing if
 i walk across this stage or gesture with my hands while i speak that motion is something that you can see
  but there 's a world of important motion that 's too subtle for the human eye  
 and over the past few years we 've started to find that cameras can often see this motion even when humans can 't 
 so let me show you what i mean 
 on the left here you see video of a person 's wrist  
 and on the right you see video of a sleeping infant but if i didn 't tell you that these were videos you might assume that you were looking at two regular
  images because in both cases these videos appear to be almost completely still 
 but there 's actually a lot of subtle motion going on here  
 and if you were to touch the wrist on the left you would feel a pulse  and if you were to hold the infant on the right 
 you would feel the rise and fall of her chest as she took each breath 
 and these motions carry a lot of
  significance  but they 're usually too subtle for us to see  
 so instead we have to observe them through direct contact through touch  
 but a few years ago  my colleagues at mit developed what they call a motion microscope  
 which is software that finds these subtle motions in video
 and amplifies them so that they become large enough for us to see
  and so if we use their software on the left video  
 it lets us see the pulse in this wrist  and if we were to count that pulse we could even figure out this person 's heart rate  
 and if we used the same software on the right video  it lets us see each breath that this infant takes  and we can use this as a
  to monitor her breathing  and so this technology is really powerful
 because it takes these phenomena that we normally have to experience through touch
 and it lets us capture them visually and non invasively 
 so a couple years ago  i started working with the folks that created that software  and we decided to pursue a crazy idea  
 we thought it 's cool
  that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch  
 but what if we could do the same thing with our ability to hear 
 what if we could use video to capture the vibrations of sound  
 which are just another kind of motion and turn everything that we see into a microphone now 
 this is a bit of a strange idea  so let me try to put it in perspective for
 traditional microphones work by converting the motion of an internal diaphragm into an electrical signal  
 and that diaphragm is designed to move readily with sound
 so that its motion can be recorded and interpreted as audio  but sound causes all objects to
  those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see so what if we record them with a high speed camera
 and then use software to extract tiny motions from our high speed video 
 and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them 
 this would let us turn visible objects into
  visual microphones from a distance
 and so we tried this out and here 's one of our experiments where we took this potted plant that you see on the right
 and we filmed it with a high speed camera while a nearby loudspeaker played this sound
  it at thousands of frames per second  
 but even if you look very closely all you 'll see are some leaves that are pretty much just sitting there doing nothing  
 because our sound only moved those leaves by about a micrometer that 's one
 of a centimeter  which spans somewhere between a hundredth and a thousandth of a pixel in
  this image  so you can squint all you want  but motion that small is pretty much perceptually invisible 
 but it turns out that something can be perceptually invisible and still be numerically significant  
 because with the right algorithms we can take this silent
  how is this possible how can we get so much information out of so little motion well let 's say
 that those leaves move by just a single micrometer  and let 's say that that shifts our image by just a thousandth of a pixel 
 that may not seem like much  but a single frame of video may have hundreds of thousands of pixels in it  
 and so if we combine all of the tiny motions that we see from across that entire image  then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel
  pixel can start to add up to something pretty significant on a personal note we were pretty psyched when we figured this out 
 laughter but
 even with the right algorithm  we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle 
 you see there are a lot of factors that affect when and how well this technique will work  there 's the object and how far away it
 there 's the camera and the lens that you use how much light is shining on the object and how loud your sound is 
 and even with the right algorithm  
 we had to be very careful with our early experiments  because if we got any of these factors wrong there was no way to tell what the problem was we would just get noise back 
 and so a lot of our early experiments looked like this
  and so here i am  
 and on the bottom left you can kind of see our high speed camera  which is pointed at a bag of chips  and the whole thing is lit by these bright lamps  
 and like i said  we had to be very careful in these early experiments  so this is how it went down
  so this experiment looks completely ridiculous 
 i mean i 'm screaming at a bag of chips and we 're blasting it with so much light we literally melted the first bag we tried this
  and this was really significant  because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object 
 and so it gave us this point of reference
  and gradually we could start to modify the experiment 
 using different objects or moving the object further away  using less light or quieter sounds 
 and we analyzed all of these experiments until we really understood the limits of our technique  
 because once we understood those limits we could figure out how to push them 
 and that led to experiments like this one
 where again i 'm going to speak to a bag of chips  
 but this time we 've moved our camera about fifteen feet away outside behind a soundproof window  
 and the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight
 and so here 's the video that we captured and this is what
  and here 's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside behind that window
  there are other ways that we can push these limits as well  so here 's a quieter experiment
 where we filmed some earphones plugged into a laptop computer  and in this case our goal was to recover the music that was playing on that laptop
 from just silent video of these two little plastic earphones
  and we were able to do this so well that i could even shazam our results
  we can also push things by changing the hardware that we use 
 because the experiments i 've shown you so far were done with a camera a high speed camera that can record video about a one hundred times faster than most cell phones  
 but we 've also found a way to use this technique with more regular cameras
  and we do that by taking advantage of what 's called a rolling shutter 
 you see most cameras record images one row at a time  and so if an object moves during
 the recording of a single image  there 's a slight time delay between each row  and this causes
 slight artifacts that get coded into each frame of a video  and so what we found
 is that by analyzing these artifacts we can actually recover sound
  sound using a modified version of our algorithm  
 so here 's an experiment we did where we filmed a bag of candy while a nearby loudspeaker played the same mary had a little lamb music from before  
 but this time we used just a regular store bought camera 
 and so in a second i 'll play for you the sound that we recovered and it 's going to sound distorted this
  that sounds distorted
  what 's really amazing here
 is that we were able to do this with something that you could literally run out and pick up at a best buy  
 so at this point a lot of people see this work and they immediately think about surveillance  and
 to be fair it 's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone  but
 keep in mind that there 's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance in fact
 people have been using lasers to eavesdrop on objects from a distance for decades  
 but what 's really new here what 's really different is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object 
 which gives us a new lens through which to look at the world  
 and we can use that lens to learn not just about forces like sound that cause an object to vibrate  
 but also about the object
  itself  
 and so i want to take a step back and and think about how that might change the ways that we use video  
 because we usually use video to look at things and i 've just shown you how we can use it to listen to things  
 but there 's another important way that we learn about the world that 's by interacting with it 
 we push and pull and poke and prod things we
 shake things and see what happens  and that 's something that video still won 't let us do 
 at least not traditionally  
 so i want to show you some new work  and this is based on an idea i had just a few months ago  so this is actually the first time i 've shown it to a public audience  
 and the basic idea is that we 're going to use the vibrations in a video
 to capture objects in a way that
  will let us interact with them
 and see how they react to us 
 so here 's an object and in this case it 's a wire figure in the shape of a human  
 and we 're going to film that object with just a regular camera  so there 's nothing special about this camera in fact i 've actually done this with my cell phone before  
 but we do want to see the object vibrate  so to make that happen we 're just going to bang a little bit on the surface
  surface where it 's resting while we record this video
 so that 's it just five seconds of regular video  while we bang on this surface  
 and we 're going to use the vibrations in that video
 to learn about the structural and material properties of our object and we 're going to use that information
 to create something new and interactive  
 and so here 's what we 've created 
 and it looks like a regular image  but this isn 't an image and it 's not a video  
 because now i can take my mouse and i can start interacting with the object
 and so what you see here
 is a simulation of how this object would respond to new forces that we 've never seen before  
 and we created it from just five seconds of regular video
  so this is a really powerful way to look at the world  because it lets us predict how objects will respond to new situations  
 and you could imagine for instance looking at an old bridge
 and wondering what would happen how would that bridge hold up if i were
 drive my car across it and that 's a question that you probably want to answer before you start driving across that bridge 
 and of course there are going to be limitations to this technique just like there were with the visual microphone  but
 we found that it works in a lot of situations that you might not expect  
 especially if you give it longer videos  so for example here 's a video that i captured of a bush outside of my apartment  
 and i didn 't do anything to this bush
  but by capturing a minute long video a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations
 that we could learn enough about this bush to create this simulation 
 and so you could imagine giving this
  and letting him control  say the strength and direction of wind in a shot after it 's been recorded 
 or in this case  we pointed our camera at a hanging curtain  
 and you can 't even see any motion in this video  
 but by recording a two minute long video  natural air currents in this room created enough subtle
  imperceptible motions and vibrations that we could learn enough to create this simulation  
 and
 ironically we 're kind of used to having this kind of interactivity when it comes to virtual objects 
 when it comes to video games and 3d models  
 but to be able to capture this information from real objects in the real world using just simple
  is something new that has a lot of potential  so
 here are the amazing people who worked with me on these projects applause
 and what i 've shown you 
  today is only the beginning  we 've just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging  
 to capture our surroundings with common accessible technology  
 and so looking to the future it 's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world
