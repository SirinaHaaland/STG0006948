  because we 're beginning to get all the tools together to evolve ourselves  and we can evolve bacteria and we can evolve plants and we can evolve
  and we 're now reaching a point where we really have to ask is it really ethical and do we want to evolve human beings and
 as you 're thinking about that let me talk about that in the context of prosthetics 
 prosthetics past present future  
 so this is the iron hand that belonged to one of the german counts  loved to fight  
 lost his arm in one of these battles  no problem he just made a suit of armor put it on
  perfect prosthetic that 's where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from and of course these prosthetics have been getting
 more and more useful more and more modern you can hold soft boiled eggs  you can have all types of controls and as you 're thinking about that 
 there are wonderful people like hugh herr who have been building absolutely extraordinary prosthetics 
 so the wonderful aimee mullins will go out and
 say how tall do i want to be tonight or hugh will say what type of cliff do i want to climb  or
 does somebody want to run a marathon or does somebody want to ballroom dance and as you adapt these things the interesting thing about prosthetics is they 've been coming inside the body  
 so these external prosthetics have now become artificial knees they 've become
  and then they 've evolved further
 to become not just nice to have but essential to have 
 so when you 're talking about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic you
 're talking about something that isn 't just i 'm missing my leg it 's if i don 't have this i can die and at that point a prosthetic becomes a symbiotic
 relationship with the human body and four of the smartest people that i 've ever met ed boyden hugh herr joe jacobson
  bob lander
 are working on a center for extreme bionics and the interesting thing of what you 're seeing here is these prosthetics now get integrated into the bone they get integrated into the skin they get integrated into the muscle  
 and one of the other sides of ed
 is he 's been thinking about how to connect the brain using light or other mechanisms directly to things like these prosthetics
  and if you can do that then you can begin
 changing fundamental aspects of humanity  so how quickly you react to something depends on the diameter of a nerve  
 and of course if you have nerves that are external or prosthetic 
 say with light or liquid metal  then you can increase that diameter and you could even increase it theoretically to the point where as long as you could see the muzzle flash
  flash you could step out of the way of a bullet 
 those are the order of magnitude of changes you 're talking about 
 this is a fourth sort of level of prosthetics these are phonak hearing aids and
 the reason why these are so interesting is because they cross the threshold from where prosthetics are something for somebody who is disabled 
 and they become something that somebody who is
  normal might want to actually have 
 because what this prosthetic does which is really interesting is not only does it help you hear you can focus your hearing so it can hear the conversation going on over there 
 you can have superhearing you can have hearing in three hundred and sixty degrees you can have white noise you can record and oh by the way they also put a phone into this  
 so this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone and at that point somebody might actually
  want to have a prosthetic
 voluntarily  
 all of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces are coming together  
 and it 's about time we ask the question how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two 
 and for that we turn to a great philosopher
 who was a very smart man despite being a yankee fan
  yogi berra used to say of course that it 's very tough to make predictions especially about the future 
 so instead of making a prediction about the future to begin with let 's take what 's happening in the present with people like tony atala 
 who is redesigning 30 some odd organs  
 and maybe the ultimate prosthetic isn 't having something external titanium maybe the ultimate prosthetic is take your own gene code remake your own body parts
  because that 's a whole lot more effective than any kind of a prosthetic  
 but while you 're at it then you can take the work of craig venter and ham smith  
 and one of the things that we 've been doing is trying to figure out how to reprogram cells 
 and if you can reprogram a cell then you can change the cells in those organs  
 so if you can change the cells in those organs maybe you make those organs more radiation resistant maybe you make them
  more oxygen maybe you make them more efficient to filter out
 stuff that you don 't want in your body 
 and over the last few weeks george church has been in the news a lot because he 's been talking about taking one of these programmable cells and inserting an entire human genome
 into that cell  and once you can insert an entire human genome into a
  then you begin to ask the question would you want to enhance any of that genome 
 do you want to enhance a human body  
 how would you want to enhance a human body  where is it ethical to enhance a human body and where is it not ethical to enhance a human body  
 and all of a sudden what we 're doing
 is we 've got this multidimensional chess board
 where we can change human genetics by using viruses to attack things like aids  or we can change the
  gene code through gene therapy to do away with
 some hereditary diseases or we can change the environment and change the expression of those genes in the epigenome
 and pass that on to the next generations  
 and all of a sudden it 's not just one little bit it 's all these stacked little bits that allow you to take little portions of it
 until all the portions coming together lead you to something that 's very different
 and a lot of people are very scared by this stuff
 and it does sound scary  and there are risks to this stuff  
 so why in the world would you ever want to do this stuff why would we really want to alter the human body in a fundamental way  
 the answer lies in part with lord
  astronomer royal of great britain  
 and one of his favorite sayings is the universe is one hundred percent malevolent  so what does that mean it means if you take any one of your bodies
 at random  drop it anywhere in the universe  drop it in space  you die  
 drop it on the sun you die drop it on the surface of mercury you die  drop it near a supernova you die  
 but fortunately it 's only about eighty percent effective
  so as a great physicist once said there 's these little upstream eddies of biology that create order
 in this rapid torrent
 of entropy  so as the universe dissipates energy  there 's these upstream eddies
 that create biological order 
 now the problem with eddies is they tend to disappear they shift they move in rivers and
  because of that when an eddy shifts when the earth becomes a snowball when the earth becomes very hot when the earth gets hit by an asteroid when you have supervolcanoes when you have solar flares  
 when you have
 potentially extinction level events like the next election 
 then all of a sudden you can have periodic extinctions  and by the way that 's happened five times on earth
  and therefore it is very likely
 that the human species on earth is going to go extinct someday 
 not next week not next month  maybe in november but maybe ten thousand years after that 
 as you 're thinking of the consequence of that 
 if you believe that extinctions are common and natural and normal and occur periodically it becomes a moral imperative to diversify our species
 it becomes a moral imperative because
 it 's going to be really hard to live on mars if we don 't fundamentally modify the human body  
 right  you go from one cell  mom and dad coming together to make one cell in a cascade to ten trillion cells we don 't know 
 if you change the gravity substantially if the same thing will happen to create your body
  we do know that if you expose our bodies as they currently are to a lot of radiation  we will die  
 so as you 're thinking of that you have to really redesign things just to get to mars forget about
 the moons of neptune or jupiter and to borrow from 
 let 's think about life in a series of scales  so life one civilization is a civilization that begins to alter his or her looks
  and we 've been doing that for thousands of years
 you 've got tummy tucks and you 've got this and you 've got that you alter
 your looks and i 'm told that not all of those alterations take place for medical reasons 
 laughter seems odd a life two civilization is a different civilization 
 a life two civilization alters fundamental aspects
  of the body  
 so you put human growth hormone in the person grows taller or you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism or does a whole series of things but you 're altering the functions in a fundamental way 
 to become an
  civilization we 're going to have to create a life three civilization  
 and that looks very different from what we 've got here maybe you splice in deinococcus radiodurans
  so that the cells can resplice after a lot of exposure to radiation  
 maybe you breathe by having oxygen flow through your blood instead of through your lungs but you 're talking about really radical redesigns  
 and one of the interesting things that 's happened in the last decade is we 've discovered a whole lot of planets out there 
  the problem is if we ever want to get to these planets 
 the fastest human objects juno and voyager and the rest of this stuff take tens of thousands of years to get from here to the nearest solar system  
 so if you want to start exploring beaches somewhere else  or you want to see two sun sunsets  
 then you 're talking about something that is very different because you have to change the timescale
 and the body of humans in ways which may be absolutely unrecognizable  and that 's a life four civilization  
 now we can 't even begin to imagine what that might look like but we 're beginning to get glimpses
 of instruments that might take us even that far  and let me give you two examples so this is the wonderful floyd romesberg and one of the things
  floyd 's been doing is he 's been playing with the basic chemistry of life  so all life on this planet
 is made in atcgs the four letters of dna all bacteria all plants all animals all humans all cows everything else  
 and what floyd did is he changed out two of those base pairs  so 
  and that means that you now have a parallel
 system to make life to make babies to reproduce to evolve 
 that doesn 't mate with most things on earth or in fact maybe with nothing on earth 
 maybe you make plants that are immune to all bacteria maybe you make plants that are immune to all viruses  but why is that so interesting it means
 that we are not a unique solution it means you can create alternate chemistries to
  us that could be chemistries
 adaptable to a very different planet
 that could create life and heredity  
 the second experiment  
 or the other implication of this experiment is that all of you all life is based on twenty amino acids  if you don
  then you go from twenty building blocks to one hundred and seventy two and all
 of a sudden you 've got one hundred and seventy two building blocks of amino acids to build life forms in very different shapes the
 second experiment  to think about is a really weird experiment that 's been taking place in china  
 so this guy has been transplanting hundreds of mouse heads
 right  and why is that an interesting experiment well 
 think of the first heart transplants one of the things they used to do is they used to bring in the wife or the daughter of the donor
 so the donee could tell the doctors do you recognize this person do you love this person do you feel anything for this person
  we laugh about that today  
 we laugh because we know the heart is a muscle but for hundreds of thousands of years or tens of thousands of years 
 i gave her my heart she took my heart she broke my heart we thought this was emotion
 and we thought maybe emotions were transplanted with the heart nope  
 so how about the brain two possible outcomes to this experiment  if you can get a mouse
 that is functional  then you can see
  is the new brain a blank slate  and boy does that have implications 
 second option  
 the new mouse recognizes minnie mouse the new mouse remembers what it 's afraid of remembers how to navigate the maze  and if that is true  
 then you can transplant memory and consciousness 
 and then the really interesting question is
  if you can transplant this is the only input output mechanism
 this down here 
 or could you transplant that consciousness into something that would be very different 
 that would last in space that would last tens of thousands of years that would be a completely redesigned body that could hold consciousness
 for a long long period of
  's come back to the first question why would you ever want to do that 
  because this is the ultimate selfie 
 this is taken from six billion miles away  and that 's earth  
 and that 's all of us  and if that little
  all of humanity goes  
 and the reason you want to alter the human body is because you eventually want a picture that says 
 that 's us  and that 's us  and that 's us  because that 's the way humanity survives long term extinction  
 and that 's the reason why it turns out it 's actually unethical
 not to evolve the human body even though it can be scary even though it can be challenging  but it 's what 's going to allow us to explore live
 and get to places we can 't even dream of today  but which our
