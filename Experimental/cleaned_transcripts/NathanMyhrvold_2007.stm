  in the atacama desert  sitting in a hotel lobby because that 's the only place that i can get a wi fi connection  and i have this picture up on my screen and a woman comes up behind me
  i could sense that she thought i was speaking synecdochically
  i had just been in the falkland islands taking pictures of penguins this is a gentoo penguin  
 and she was still skeptical so  literally a few minutes before that i downloaded this scientific paper
 about calculations on avian defecation  which is really quite interesting because it turns out you can model this
  you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the
 avian rectum actually technically it 's not a rectum it 's called a cloaca at this point she stops me 
 and she says who are you wha
 what do you do 
 and i was stuck  because i didn 't have any way to describe what i do and so in some sense this
  talk today is my answer to that it 's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that i do
 and it 's very hard for me to make sense of it so i 'm
 not sure that you can it 's the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes often at four in the morning
  so  some people are afraid of what i do some people think i am the nerd tony soprano
  soprano and in response i have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector  i 'm not sure what these people think because i don
 't speak norsk 
 but i 'm not thinking monsteret is a good thing i don 't know you know  so  one of the things that i love to
 do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites  because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations and see where they succeeded and where they failed use science to you know 
 work backwards and say well  really what were they thinking and recently i was in easter island  
 which is an incredibly beautiful place and
 an incredibly mysterious place because no matter where you go in easter island you 're struck by these statues called the moai
  place is sixty four square miles they made so far as we can tell nine hundred of them  
 why on earth  
 and if you haven 't read jared diamond 's book collapse i totally recommend that you do he 's got a great chapter about it  basically these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of
  let 's cut down the last tree and commit suicide because we need more identical statues laughter
 and 
 one thing that isn 't a mystery actually was when i grew up because when i was a little kid i 'd seen these pictures and i thought well 
 why that look on the face why that brow i mean it 's such a powerful thing where did they get that inspiration  
  then i met yoyo who is the native rapa nui an guide and if you look at yoyo 's face you kind of figure out where they got it  there 's
 many mysteries these statues everyone wants to know how did they make them how did they transport them 
 this woman in the foreground is jo anne van tilberg she 's the leading archaeologist
 working easter island today  and she has studied the statues for 20 some years  
 and she has detailed records of every single statue the one on the page here is the same that 's up there
 one interesting problem is the stone isn 't very hard so this used to be completely smooth in fact
 in many of the statues  when you excavate them the backs are totally smooth almost glass smooth  but after one thousand years out in the weather they look like this
  jo anne and i have just embarked on a project to digitize them all
  going to do a very high res digitization first because it 's a way of preserving them second we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically then learn a few of the mysteries about them how long have they been standing in what positions 
 and maybe indirectly get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are
 while i was in easter island comet mcnaught was there also so you
 get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet 
 i also have an archaeological project going on in egypt
  going on is perhaps a little bit
 strong we 're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set to get it going so i 'll talk about it at a future ted but there 's some amazing opportunities in egypt as well
 another thing i do is i invent stuff in fact  i design nuclear reactors
  the conventional nuclear fuel cycle  
 the red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors it 's called the open fuel cycle
  the white lines are what 's called an advance fuel cycle where you reprocess  
 now  this is the normal way it 's done it 's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution it
  it has a lot of disadvantages each one of these steps is extremely expensive it 's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone 's backyard  
 which is a problem  so  our reactor eliminates these steps 
 which if we can actually make it work is a really cool thing 
 now it 's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor there 's no reactor 's been even built to an old design much less a new one in the united states for
 it 's the kind of very high risk but potentially very high return thing that we do
  changing into a totally different field we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics particularly in an area called metamaterials 
 a metamaterial is an artificial material which manipulates in this case electromagnetic radiation in a way that you couldn 't otherwise 
 so this
  device here is an invisibility cloak it
 may not seem that but if you were a microwave  
 this is how you would view it  rays of light in this case microwave light come in and they just squish around the cell and they come back the other side now 
 you could do that with mirrors from one angle the cool thing is this does it from all
  it only works on microwave and b it doesn 't work all that well yet  but metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field
  it 's you know today i 'd like to say it 's a zero billion dollar business but in fact it 's negative
  but some day some day  maybe it 's going to work we do a lot of work in biomedical
  working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing
 diseases in developing countries so they say the eyes are the windows of the soul turns out they 're a window to a whole lot more stuff and
 these happen to be my eyes by the way  
 now  i 'm also very interested in cooking while i was at microsoft i took a leave of absence
  and went to a chef school in france i used to work also while at microsoft at a
 leading restaurant in seattle so i do a lot of cooking i 've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue 
 but barbecue 's interesting because it 's one of these cult foods
 like chili or bouillabaisse various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to
 there 's tremendous
  there 's secrecy  and i 'm trying to use a very scientific approach  so  this is my latest cooker  and
 if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor  that 's because it is
  but if you get to play with all those knobs and dials and of course really the controller over there does it all on software
 you can make some terrific ribs
  you should all have one in your kitchen beside your turbochef 
 this subjects food to a force about fifty thousand times that of normal normal gravity 
 and oh boy does it clarify chicken stock you would not believe it 
 i perform a series of ghoulish experiments on on food
 in this case  trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are
  it turns out a it 's useful and for a geek like me it 's fun  theory is red black is experiment 
 so i 'm either really good at faking it or this particular model seems to work 
 so  another random thing i do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or seti  and you may be familiar
  which sort of popularized that it turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way  in fact  
 almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character a real person so the jodie foster character here is actually this woman jill tarter  
 and jill has
 dedicated her life to this you know a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism  which
 is kind of cool
 but jill has what i call slow heroism  she is risking her professional life on something that
 her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years may not ever 
 so i like to support people that are risking their lives after the movie came out of course there was a lot of interest in seti
  the seti institute with a little bit of help from me and a lot of help from paul allen and a variety of other people
  is building a dedicated radio telescope in hat creek california so they can do this seti work now
 i travel a lot and i change cell phones a lot and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is jill because i really don 't want to miss
 so i do a lot of work on dinosaurs
  i 'm known to tedsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs  
 and i resemble that remark  i 'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs which is the finding of them  
 now  to find dinosaurs you hike around in horrible conditions
 looking for a dinosaur it sounds really dumb but that 's what it is it 's horrible conditions because wherever you have
 nice weather  plants grow and you don 't get any erosion and you don 't see any dinosaurs so 
 you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring you
 know skiers pray for snow  paleontologists pray for erosion so
 you hike around
 and this is after you dig them up they look like this  you hike around you see something
  like this now this is something i found so look at it very closely here you 've got this
 bentonite clay  which is sort of swells up and expands and there 's some stuff poking out so you look at that and you look up close and
 you say well gee that 's kind of interesting what are all of these pieces well 
 if you look closely
  you can recognize actually from the shape that these are skull fragments  and then when you look at this you say that 's a tooth it
 's a big tooth it 's about the size of a banana 
 it has a big serration on the edge  
 this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground and this is what it 's like to find a tyrannosaurus rex 
 which i was lucky enough to do a few years ago
  this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room 
 not the same one actually this is a cast  which i had bought and then after buying the cast i found my own and i don 't have room for two you
 know so  the thing that 's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual
 thing because you 're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago  it 's something that can inform all sorts
  of science in unexpected ways the study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there 's a problem with
 asteroid impact for example the study of dinosaurs may literally one day save the planet study of the ancient climate
 is very important in fact the mesozoic when dinosaurs lived had much higher co2 than today was much warmer than today and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of
  on climate 
 but besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting  it 's also very different than the other things i do because you get to hike around in the badlands  
 this is actually what most dinosaur research looks like this is one of my papers a pygostyle from a non avian theropod it 's not as gripping as dinosaur sex so we 're not going to go into it further
  i 'm also really big on photography  i travel all over the world taking pictures
 some of them good most of them not these days bits are cheap  unfortunately that means you 've got to spend more time sorting through them 
 here 's a picture i took in the falkland islands
 of king penguins on a beach here 's a picture i took in alaska a few years ago of orcas
  for a week  and we hadn 't seen a damn orca and the last day the sun comes out the orcas come they 're right by the boat it 's fantastic and i get lots of pictures like this 
 then a little bit later  i start getting some pictures like this  now  to a human audience i need to explain that
 if penthouse magazine had a marine mammal
  there 's more and more activity near the boat and all of a sudden somebody shouts what 's that in the water i said 
 well  i think that 's what you call a free willy 
 there 's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have
  the first thing you learn is the overwhelming importance of hands they don 't have them 
 i think paul simon is in the audience  and he has he may not realize it but he wrote a song all about whale sex 
 that 's kind of what it 's like the other interesting thing that i learned about about whale sex they curl their toes
  too 
 so where do you
 go putting all of these disparate pieces together  
 you know  there 's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing  passion in life and focusing all your energy on it  
 and i 've never been able to do
  focus passion on something 
 but then there will be something else and then there 's something else again and for a long time i fought this and i thought well gee i really ought to buckle down 
 and you know when i was at microsoft  that was so engrossing  and the whole industry was expanding so much that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life
  but
 ultimately i decided that what i really ought to do is not fight being who i am
 but embrace it and say yeah  you know  i this whole talk has been
 a mile wide and an inch deep  but that 's really what works for me and regardless of whether it 's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex 
 the common or lowest common denominator is me
