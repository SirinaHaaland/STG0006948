  teacher and a practitioner of civics in america now i will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep to please wake up 
 why is it that the very word civics has such a soporific even a narcoleptic effect on us i think it 's because
 the very word signifies something exceedingly virtuous exceedingly important and exceedingly boring  
 well i think it 's the responsibility of people like us people who show up for gatherings like this in person or online in any way we can 
 to make civics sexy again 
 as sexy as it was during the
  as sexy as it was during the civil rights movement
 and i believe the way we make civics sexy again is to make explicitly about the teaching of power
 the way we do that i believe 
 is at the level of the city  this is what i want to talk about today and
 i want to start by defining some terms and then i want to describe the scale of the problem i think we face and then suggest the ways that i believe cities can be the seat of the solution
  so let me start with some definitions  by civics i simply mean the art of being a 
  contributor
 in a self governing community civics is the art of citizenship what bill gates sr calls simply
 showing up for life  and it encompasses three things a foundation of values an understanding of the systems
  that make the world go round and a set of skills
 that allow you to pursue goals and to have others join in that pursuit and
 that brings me to my definition of power  which is simply this 
 the capacity to make others do what you would have them do it
 sounds menacing
  we find it scary  we find it somehow evil we
 feel uncomfortable naming it in the culture and mythology of democracy power resides with the people  period end of story 
 any further inquiry not necessary and not really that welcome 
 power has a negative moral valence 
 it sounds machiavellian inherently it seems inherently evil
  but in fact power is no more inherently good or evil than fire
 or physics it just is and power governs how any form of government operates whether a democracy
 or a dictatorship and
 the problem we face today here in america in particular but all around the world is that far too many people are profoundly illiterate in power
  power
 what it is who has it  how it operates  how it flows  what part of it is visible what part of it is not 
 why some people have it why that 's compounded 
 and as a result of this illiteracy those few who do understand how power operates in civic
  those who understand how a bill becomes a law yes but also
 how a friendship becomes a subsidy 
 or how a bias becomes a policy  or how a slogan becomes a movement the people who understand those things
 wield disproportionate influence  and they 're perfectly happy to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance of the great majority  
 this is why it is so fundamental for us right now
 to grab hold of this idea of power
 and to democratize it one of the things that is so profoundly exciting and challenging about this moment
 is that as a result of this power illiteracy that is so pervasive  there is a concentration
 of knowledge of understanding
  of clout i mean think about it  how does a friendship become a subsidy  
 seamlessly when a senior government official decides to leave government
 and become a lobbyist for a private interest and convert his or her relationships into capital for their new masters 
  how does a bias become a policy  insidiously 
 just the way that stop and frisk for instance  became over time a bureaucratic numbers game  
 how does a slogan become a movement  virally in the way that the tea party for instance was able to take
 the don 't tread on me flag
 from the american revolution  or how on the other side a band of activists could take a magazine headline occupy wall street
 and turn that into a global meme and movement the
 thing is though most people
 aren 't looking for and don 't want to see these realities  so much of this ignorance this civic illiteracy is willful 
 there are some millennials for instance who think the whole business is just sordid they don 't want to have anything to do with
  rather just opt out and engage in volunteerism  there are some techies out there
 who believe that the cure all for any power imbalance or power abuse is simply more data 
 more transparency  there are some on the left who think power resides only
 with corporations and some on the right who think power resides only with government each side blinded by their selective
  there are the naive who believe that
 good things just happen and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen 
 the fortunate and unfortunate alike who think that their lot is simply what they deserve
 rather than
 the eminently alterable result of a prior arrangement an inherited allocation of power 
  as a result of all of this creeping fatalism in public life we here particularly in america today have depressingly low levels of civic knowledge civic engagement participation  awareness 
 the whole business of politics has been effectively subcontracted out to a band of professionals  money people 
 outreach people message people research people
 the rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs in the sense of suckers  we become
  demotivated to learn more about how things work  we begin to opt out  
 well  this problem 
 this challenge is a thing that we must now confront  
 and i believe that when you have this kind of disengagement this willful ignorance it becomes
 both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity
 of wealth and clout that i was describing a moment ago this profound
 civic inequality  this is why it is so important in our time right now
 to reimagine civics as the teaching of power  perhaps it 's never been more important at any time
 in our lifetimes  
 if people don 't learn power people don 't wake up
  don 't wake up they get left out 
 now  
 part of the art of practicing power means being awake and having a voice but it also is about having an arena where you can plausibly practice
 deciding all of civics boils down to the simple question of who decides  and you have to play that out in a place  in an arena
  brings me to the third point that i want to make today  which is simply that
 there is no better arena in our time for the practicing
 of power than the city  
 think about the city where you live where you 're from think about a problem in the common life of your city  it can be something small
  where a street lamp should go or something medium like
 which library should have its hours extended or cut or
 maybe something bigger like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be turned into a highway or a greenway or whether all the businesses in your town should
 be required to pay a living wage think about the change that you want in your city and then think about
 how you would get it how you would make it happen
  take an inventory of all the forms of power that are at play in your city 's situation  money of course people  yes  
 ideas  information  misinformation  the threat of force the force of norms all of these
  of power are at play now think about how you would activate or perhaps neutralize
 these various forms of power  
 this is not some game of thrones
 empire level set of questions these are questions that play out in every single place on the planet i 'll
 just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines  in boulder colorado  voters not too long ago
 approved a process
 to replace the private power company
  literally the power company the electric company xcel with a publicly owned utility
 that would forego profits and attend far more to climate change  
 well xcel fought back  and xcel has now put in play a ballot measure that would
 undermine or undo this
 and so the citizen activists in boulder who have been pushing this now literally have to fight the power in order to fight for power
 in tuscaloosa at the university of alabama  
 there 's an organization on campus called kind of menacingly  the machine  
 and it draws from
 largely white sororities and fraternities on campus and for decades  the machine has dominated student government elections 
  the machine has started to get involved in actual city politics  and they 've engineered the election of a former machine member a young pro business recent graduate
 to the tuscaloosa city school board now as i say these are just two examples drawn almost at random
 from the headlines every day there are thousands more like them  
 and you may like or dislike the efforts i 'm describing here in boulder or in tuscaloosa  but you cannot help
  but admire the power literacy of the players involved their skill you cannot help but reckon with and recognize the command they have
 of the elemental questions of civic power
 what objective  what strategy  what tactics what is the terrain who are your enemies who are your allies 
 now i want you to return
  return
 to thinking about that problem or that opportunity or that challenge in your city and the thing it was that you want to fix or create in your city  
 and ask yourself do you have command of these elemental questions of power  
 could you put into practice effectively
 what it is that you know
  this is the challenge and the opportunity for us  we live in a time right now
 where
 in spite of globalization or perhaps because of globalization all citizenship is ever more resonantly powerfully local  
 indeed power in our time is flowing ever faster to the city  here in the united states the national government has tied itself
  up in partisan knots civic imagination and innovation and creativity are emerging from local ecosystems now and radiating outward  
 and
 this great innovation this great wave
 of localism that 's now arriving  and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live
  this isn 't some precious parochialism  
 this isn 't some retreat into insularity no this is emergent  
 the localism of our time is networked powerfully  and so for instance  consider the ways that
 strategies for making cities more bike friendly have spread so rapidly from copenhagen to new york to austin to boston to seattle
  think about how experiments in participatory budgeting where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation
 of city funds  those experiments have spread from porto alegre brazil
 to here in new york city  to the wards of chicago  migrant workers from rome to los angeles and many cities between
 are now organizing to stage strikes to remind the people who live in their cities what a
  day without immigrants would look like in china all across that country  members of the new citizens ' movement
 are beginning to activate and organize to fight official corruption and graft  
 and they 're drawing the ire of officials there but they 're also drawing the attention of anti corruption activists all around the world 
 in seattle where i 'm from we 've become part of a great global array of cities that are now working together
 bypassing government altogether national government altogether 
 in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals of the kyoto protocol 
 all of these citizens united are forming a web a great archipelago of power
 that allows us to bypass
 brokenness and monopolies of
  and our task now is to accelerate this work our task now is to bring more and more people into the fold of this work 
 that 's why my organization citizen university has undertaken a project now to create an everyman 's curriculum in civic power 
 and this curriculum starts with this triad that i described earlier of values systems and skills
  like to do is to invite all of you to help create this curriculum
 with the stories and the experiences and the challenges that each of you lives and faces to create something powerfully collective
 and i want to invite you in particular to try a simple exercise drawn
 from the early frameworks of this curriculum i want you to write a narrative a narrative from the future of your city  
 and you can date it set it out
 one year from now five years from now a decade from now a generation from now and write it as a case study
 looking back 
 looking back at the change that you wanted in your city  
 looking back at the cause that you were championing and describing the ways that that change and that cause came in fact to succeed
  the values of your fellow citizens that you activated and the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir 
 recount all the different ways that you engaged the systems of government of the marketplace of social institutions of faith organizations of the media  
 catalog all the skills you had to deploy  how to negotiate  how to advocate  how to frame issues  how to navigate diversity
  in conflict all those skills that enabled you to bring folks on board
 and to overcome resistance what you 'll be doing when you write that narrative
 is you 'll be discovering how to read power and in the process how to write power  
 so share what you write do you what you write and then share
  what you do 
 i invite you to literally share the narratives that you create
 on our facebook page for citizen university  
 but even beyond that it 's in the conversations that we have today all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings that are happening on this topic at this moment 
 and to think about how we can become one another 's teachers and students in power
  we do that then together we can make civics sexy again 
 together we can democratize democracy and make it safe again for amateurs  together 
 we can create a great network of city
 that will be the most powerful collective laboratory for self government this planet has ever seen  we have the power to do that thank you very much
