  i would like for my body to be laid out to be eaten by animals 
 having your body laid out to be eaten by animals is not for
  maybe you have already had the end of life talk with your family and decided on  i don 't know cremation  
 and in the interest of full disclosure what i am proposing for my dead body is not strictly legal at the moment  but it 's not without precedent 
 we 've been laying out our dead for all of human history  it 's call
  in fact it 's likely happening right now as we speak 
 in the mountainous regions of tibet they practice sky burial a ritual where the body is left to be consumed by vultures 
 in mumbai in india those who follow the parsi religion put their dead in structures called towers of silence
  these are interesting cultural tidbits  but
 they just haven 't really been that popular in the western world they 're not what you 'd expect  
 in america our death traditions have come to be chemical embalming  followed by
 burial at your local cemetery or more recently  cremation  
 i myself  am a recent vegetarian which means i spent the first thirty years or so of my life frantically inhaling
  animals as many as i could get my hands on why when i die  should they not have their turn with me 
 am i not an animal biologically speaking are we not all in this room animals 
 accepting the fact that we are animals has some potentially terrifying consequences  it means
  accepting that we are doomed to decay and die  just like any other creature
 on earth 
 for the last nine years i 've worked in the funeral industry 
 first as a crematory operator then as a mortician and most recently as the owner of my own funeral home 
 and i have some good news if you 're looking to avoid the whole doomed to decay and die
  thing  you will have all the help in the world in that avoidance from the funeral industry
  industry and its economic model is based on the principle of protection  sanitation and beautification of the corpse  
 whether they mean to or not the funeral industry promotes this
  idea of human exceptionalism it
 doesn 't matter what it takes how much it costs how bad it is for the environment we 're going to do it because humans are worth it 
 it ignores the fact that death can be an emotionally messy and complex affair and that there is beauty in decay
 beauty in the natural return to the earth from whence we came
 now i don 't want you to get me wrong i absolutely understand the importance of ritual especially when it comes to the people that we love  but 
  we have to be able to create and practice this ritual without harming the environment  which is why we need new options  
  with a dead body 
 the funeral industry will protect your dead body by offering to sell your family a casket made of hardwood or metal with a rubber sealant 
 at the cemetery on the day of burial that casket will be lowered into a large concrete or metal vault  
 we 're wasting all of these resources concretes metal hardwoods hiding them in vast
  vast underground fortresses 
 when you choose burial at the cemetery your dead body is not coming anywhere near the dirt that surrounds it 
 food for worms you are not 
 next the industry will sanitize your body
 through embalming
  the chemical preservation of the dead this procedure drains your blood and replaces it with a toxic cancer causing formaldehyde  
 they say they do this for the public health because the dead body can be dangerous  
 but the doctors in this room will tell you that that claim would only apply if the person had died of some wildly infectious disease like
  even human decomposition which let 's be honest is a little stinky and unpleasant is perfectly safe  
 the bacteria that causes disease
 is not the same bacteria that causes decomposition  
 finally  the industry will beautify the corpse they
 'll tell you that the natural dead body of your mother or father is not good enough as it
  it in makeup they 'll put it in a suit  they 'll inject dyes so the person looks a little more alive just resting 
 embalming is a cheat code  providing the illusion that death and then decay are not the natural end for all organic life on this planet  
  if this system of beautification sanitation protection
 doesn 't appeal to you you are not alone  
 there is a whole wave of people funeral directors designers environmentalists trying to come up with a more
 way of death for these people death is not necessarily a pristine makeup powder blue tuxedo
  there 's no question that our current methods of death are not particularly sustainable what with the waste of resources and our reliance on chemicals 
 even cremation  which is usually considered the environmentally friendly option uses per cremation the natural gas equivalent of a 
 car trip so where do we go from here  last summer i was in the
  of north carolina  hauling buckets of wood chips in the summer sun  
 i was at western carolina university at their body farm more accurately called a human decomposition facility 
 bodies donated to science are brought here and their decay is studied to benefit the future of
  on this particular day there were twelve bodies laid out in various stages of decomposition some were 
 one was wearing purple pajamas one still had blonde facial hair visible 
 the forensic aspect is really fascinating but not actually why i was there 
 i was there because a colleague of mine named katrina spade is attempting to create a system not of cremating the dead
 the dead  she calls the system 
 and we 've been doing it with cattle and other livestock for years  she imagines a facility where the family could come and lay their dead loved one in a 
 mixture that would in four to six weeks reduce the body bones and all to
  in those four to six weeks your molecules become other molecules you literally transform 
 how would this fit in with the very recent desire a lot of people seem to have to be buried under a tree or to become a tree when they die 
 in a traditional cremation  the ashes that are left over inorganic bone fragments form a thick  chalky layer
  unless distributed in the soil just right can actually hurt or kill the tree  
 but if you 're recomposed if you actually become the soil you can nourish the tree and become the post mortem contributor you 've always wanted to be that you deserve to be 
 so that 's one option for the future of cremation  but what about the future of cemeteries  
 there are a lot of people who think we shouldn 't even have cemeteries anymore because we 're running
  out of land  but what if we reframed it and the corpse wasn 't the land 's enemy  but its potential savior  
 i 'm talking about conservation burial where large swaths of land are purchased by a land trust  
 the beauty of this is that once you plant a few dead bodies in that land  it can 't be touched  it can 't be developed on
  hence the term conservation burial it 's the equivalent of chaining yourself to a tree  post mortem hell no i won 't go 
 no really i can 't i 'm decomposing under here 
 any money that the family gives to the cemetery would go back into protecting and managing the land 
  there are no headstones and no graves in the typical sense 
 the graves are scattered about the property under elegant mounds  marked only by a rock or a small metal disk or sometimes only locatable by gps  
 there 's no embalming no heavy metal caskets 
 my funeral home sells a few caskets made out of things like woven willow and
  most of our families just choose a simple shroud  
 there are none of the big vaults that most cemeteries require just because it makes it easier for them to landscape  
 families can come here  they can luxuriate in nature  they can even plant a tree or a shrub  though only native plants to the area are allowed 
 the dead then blend seamlessly in with the landscape  
 there 's hope in conservation
  cemeteries  they offer dedicated green space in both urban and rural areas  
 they offer a chance to reintroduce native plants and animals to a region  
 they offer public trails  places for spiritual practice  places for classes and events places where nature and mourning meet
  importantly  they offer us  once again a chance to just decompose in a hole in the ground 
 the soil  let me tell you has missed us  
 i think for a lot of people they 're starting to get the sense that our current funeral industry isn 't really working for them 
 for many of us
  sanitized and beautified just doesn 't reflect us  it doesn 't reflect what we stood for during our lives 
 will changing the way we bury our dead solve climate change no  
 but it will make bold moves in how we see ourselves as citizens of this planet  
 if we can die in a way that is more humble and 
 i believe that we stand a chance  thank you
