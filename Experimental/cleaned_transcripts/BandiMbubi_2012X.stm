  i want to talk to you today about a difficult topic that is close to me and closer than you might realize to you 
 i came to the uk  twenty one
  i was forced to leave the democratic republic of the congo  my home  where i was a student activist 
 i would love my children to be able to meet my family in the congo  
 but i want to tell you what
  the congo has got to do with you  
 but first of all i want you to do me a favor  can you all please reach into your pockets
 and take out your mobile phone  
 feel that familiar weight  
 how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons 
 can you imagine your world without it it connects us
 to our loved ones our family friends
 and colleagues  at home and overseas  it is a symbol of an interconnected world  
 but what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail and it all boils down to a
  in the congo as coltan  it is an anticorrosive heat conductor it stores energy
 in our mobile phones  playstations
 and laptops  it is used in aerospace and medical equipment
 as an alloy it is so powerful
  that we only need tiny amounts it would be great
 if the story ended there unfortunately what you hold in your hand
 has not only
 enabled incredible technological development
 and industrial expansion  but it has also contributed to unimaginable human suffering
  have died in the democratic republic of the congo  countless women men and children have been raped  tortured
 or enslaved  rape is used as a weapon of war instilling fear
 and depopulating whole areas  the quest for extracting this mineral
 has not
  only aided  but it has fueled the ongoing war in the congo  
 but don 't throw away your phones yet  thirty thousand children
 are enlisted and are made to fight in armed groups 
 the congo consistently scores
  dreadfully
 in global health and poverty rankings  
 but remarkably  the un environmental programme has estimated the wealth of the country
 to be
 over
  has collapsed and control over mines
 has splintered coltan is easily controlled by armed groups  one well known illicit trade route
 is that across the border to rwanda  where congolese tantalum is disguised as rwandan  
 but don 't throw away your phones yet  because the incredible irony is that
 the technology that has placed such unsustainable devastating demands on the congo is the same technology
 that has brought this situation to our attention 
 we only know so much about the situation in the congo and in the mines because of the kind of communication the mobile phone allows
  as with the arab spring  during the recent elections in the congo  
 voters were able to send text messages of local polling stations to the headquarters
 in the capital kinshasa and in the wake
 of the result
  the diaspora has joined with the carter center  the catholic church
 and other observers to draw attention to the undemocratic result  
 the mobile phone has given people around the world
 an important tool towards gaining their political freedom 
 it has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet
 it has allowed momentous political change to take place 
 so we are faced with a paradox  
 the mobile phone is an instrument of freedom
 and an instrument
 of oppression
  celebrated what technology can do for us technology in its finished form  it is time
 to be asking questions about technology where does it come from who makes it 
 and for what 
 i am speaking directly to you 
 the ted community and to all those who might be watching on a screen 
 on your phone across the world in the congo 
 all the technology is in place for us to communicate 
 and all the technology is in place to communicate this 
 at the moment there is no clear
 fair trade solution  
 but there has been a huge amount of progress  
 the us has recently passed legislation to target bribery and misconduct in the congo  
 recent uk legislation could be used in the same way 
 in february  nokia unveiled its new policy on sourcing minerals in the congo
  and there is a petition to apple to make a 
 there are campaigns spreading across university campuses to make their colleges
  change their sourcing processes  
 when i first came to the uk  twenty one years ago  i was homesick i missed my family
 and the friends i left behind 
 communication was extremely difficult  sending and receiving letters took months
 if you were lucky  often they never arrived
  even if i could have afforded
 the phone bills home  like most people in the congo  my parents did not own a phone line 
 today my two sons
 david and daniel  can talk to my parents
  and get to know them  
 why should we allow such a wonderful  brilliant
 and necessary
 product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings
  is an idea worth spreading  thank you
