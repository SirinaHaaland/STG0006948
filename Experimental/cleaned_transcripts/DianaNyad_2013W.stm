  it 's the fifth time i stand on this shore  the cuban shore looking out at that distant horizon
  again that i 'm going to make it
 all the way across that vast dangerous wilderness of an ocean 
 not only have i tried four times but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since one thousand nine hundred and fifty 
 and it 's still never been done  
 the team is proud
 of our four attempts  it 's an expedition of some thirty
  people bonnie
 is my best friend and head handler 
 who somehow summons will that last drop of will within me when i think it 's gone after many many hours and days out there 
 the shark experts are the best in the world large predators below
  the box jellyfish the deadliest venom in all of the ocean is in these waters and i have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt  
 the
 conditions themselves besides the sheer distance of over one hundred miles in the open ocean
 the currents and whirling eddies and the gulf stream itself the most unpredictable of all of the planet earth
  and by the way it 's amusing to me that
 journalists and people before these attempts often
 ask me well are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything and i 'm
 thinking what are they imagining that i 'll just sort of do some celestial navigation and
 carry a bowie knife in my mouth
  fish and skin them alive and eat them and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water 
 yes i have a team 
 and the team is expert  and the team is courageous  and brimming with innovation
 and scientific discovery as
  is true of any major
 expedition on the planet 
 and we 've been on a journey
 and the debate has raged hasn 't it since the greeks of isn 't it what it 's all about isn 't life
 about the journey not really the destination and here we 've been on this journey and the truth is it 's been thrilling we haven 't reached that other shore
  and still our sense of pride and commitment unwavering commitment when i turned sixty  
 the dream was still alive
 from having tried this in my 20s dreamed it and imagined it the most famous body of water on the earth today
  was deep in my soul 
 when i turned sixty  
 it wasn 't so much about the athletic accomplishment it wasn 't the ego of i want to be the first that 's always there and it 's undeniable 
 but it was deeper it was how much life is there left let 's face it we 're all on a one way street aren 't we 
 and what are we going to do what are we going to do
 as we go forward to have no regrets
  looking back 
 and all this past year in training 
 i had that teddy roosevelt quote to paraphrase it floating around in my brain it says you go ahead  
 you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic you be the observer 
 while the brave one gets in the ring
 and engages
 and gets bloody and gets dirty and
  fails over and over and over again but yet isn 't afraid and isn 't timid and lives life in a bold way 
 and so of course i want to make it across it is the goal  and
 i should be so shallow to say that this year  the destination was even sweeter than the journey
  itself was worthwhile taking  
 and at this point by this summer  everybody scientists sports scientists
  endurance experts  neurologists 
 my own team  bonnie
 said it 's impossible  it just
 simply can 't be done and bonnie said to me but if you 're going to take the journey  i 'm going to see you through to the end of it so i 'll be there 
 and now we 're there
 as we 're looking out kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke standing on the rocks at marina hemingway  
 the cuban flag is flying above all my team is out in their boats 
 hands up in the air we 're here 
 we 're here for you
  bonnie and i look at each other and say this year the mantra is and i 've been using it in training find a way  you have a dream
 and you have obstacles in front of you as we all do  none of us ever get through this life without heartache 
  and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a
 great human quality you find your way  and bonnie grabbed my shoulders and she said let 's find our way to florida 
 and we started and for the next
  it was an intense unforgettable life experience  
 the highs were high the awe i 'm not a religious person but i 'll tell you to be in the azure blue of the gulf stream as if as 
  you 're breathing  you 're looking down miles and miles and miles 
  i have a playlist of about eighty five songs and especially in the middle of the night that night because we use no lights lights attract jellyfish lights attract sharks lights attract
 baitfish that attract sharks  so we go in the pitch black of the night you 've never seen black this black
  am because there 's no visual at all and i 'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist 
 i 've got tight rubber caps i don 't hear a thing i 've got goggles and i 'm turning my head fifty times a minute and i 'm singing 
 imagine there 's no heaven doo
 doo doo doo doo it 's easy if you try
 doo doo doo doo doo and i can sing that song a thousand times in a row 
 now there 's a talent unto itself 
 and each time i get done with
  and when i get through the end of a thousand of john lennon 's imagine i have swum nine hours and forty five minutes exactly 
 and then there are the crises of course there are and the vomiting starts  the seawater you 're not well you 're wearing a
  jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection  it 's difficult to swim in it 's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth  but the tentacles can 't get you  
 and the hypothermia sets in the water 's eighty five degrees and yet you 're losing weight and using calories and as you come over toward the side of the boat 
  not allowed to touch it not allowed to get out but bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and ask me
  all right i am seeing the taj mahal 
 over here  i 'm in a very different state 
 and i 'm thinking wow  i never thought i 'd be running into the taj mahal out here  it 's
  we kind of have a cardinal rule that i 'm never told how far it is because we don 't know how far it is what 's going to happen to you between this point and that point what 's going to happen to the weather and the currents and 
 god forbid you 're stung when you don 't think you could be stung in all this armor
 bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning
 that i was suffering  and
 i was hanging on by a thread  
 and she said come here and i came close to the boat and she said look 
 look out there and i saw light 
 because the day is easier than the night and i thought we were coming into day  i saw a stream of white light along the horizon  and i said it 's going to be
  soon and she said no those are the lights of key west 
 it was fifteen more hours  which for most swimmers would be a long time 
 you have no idea how many 15 hour training swims i had done 
 so here we go and i somehow without a decision
 went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting stephen hawking on the
 parameters of the universe i just went into thinking about this dream and why
 and how as i said when i turned sixty it wasn 't about that concrete
  that 's the everyday machinations that 's the discipline and it 's the preparation and there 's a pride in that but
 i decided to think as i went along about
 you know the phrase usually is reaching for the stars and in my case it 's reaching for the horizon  
 and when you reach for the horizon  as i 've proven you may not get
  what a tremendous build of character and spirit
 that you that you lay down what a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons
  and now the shore is coming  
 and there 's just a little part of me that 's sad  the epic journey is going to be over so many people come up
  that little tracker on the computer when are you going to do the next one we can 't wait to follow the next one well they were just there for fifty three hours and
 i was there for years  and
 so there won 't be another epic journey in the ocean but the point is and the point was that
 every day of our lives is epic and i 'll tell you when i walked up onto that beach
  up onto that beach i had so many times in a very  puffed up ego way  
 rehearsed what i would say 
 on the beach when bonnie thought the back of my throat was swelling up she brought the medical team over to our boat to say she 's really beginning to have trouble breathing another twelve
  saltwater the whole thing i just thought in my hallucinatory moment that i heard the word tracheotomy laughter
 bonnie said to the doctor i 'm not worried about her not breathing if she can 't talk when she gets to the shore she 's going to be pissed off
  that i had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation
 it wasn 't like that it was a very real moment with that crowd with my team 
 we did it  i didn 't do it we did it and we 'll never forget it it 'll always be part of us
 the three things i did sort of blurt out when we got there was first never ever give up 
  it what 's the phrase from today from socrates audience to be is to do diana nyad 
 to be is to do so i don 't stand up and say don 't ever give up i didn 't give up  
 there was action behind these words the second is  you can chase your dreams at any age you 're never too old 
  no one at any age any gender  could ever do has done it and
  doubt in my mind that i am at the prime of my life today 
 yeah 
 thank you  
 and the third thing i said on that beach was it looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world and in many ways of course it is 
 and in other ways  and the most important ways  it 's a
  team  and if you think i 'm a badass you want to meet bonnie bonnie where are you  where are you  
 there 's bonnie stoll 
 my buddy 
 the henry david thoreau quote
  when you achieve your dreams it 's not so much what you get
 as who you have become in achieving them 
 and yeah i stand before you now in the three months since that swim ended i 've sat down with oprah  
 and i 've been in president obama 's oval office 
 i 've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves i 've signed a wonderful major book contract all of that 's great and i don 't denigrate it i 'm
 proud of it all but the truth is i 'm walking around tall because i am that bold
  fearless person  and i will be every day until it 's time
 for these days to be done thank you very much and enjoy the conference
