  be willing to bet that i 'm the dumbest guy in the room
 because i couldn 't get through school i struggled with school  
 but what i knew at a very early age was that i loved money and i loved business and i loved this entrepreneurial thing 
 and i was raised to be an entrepreneur  and what i 've been really passionate about ever since and i 've never spoken about this ever
  until now so this is the first time anyone 's ever heard it except my wife three days ago because she said what are you talking about and i told her
 is that i think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing 
 it 's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified which is what happens in a lot of society 
 kids when we grow up
  up have dreams  
 and we have passions and we have visions and somehow we get those things crushed we get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor 
 my parents got me a tutor in french  and i still suck in french
  two years ago i was the highest rated lecturer at mit 's entrepreneurial master 's program  and it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world when i was in grade two i
 a city wide speaking competition  
 but nobody had ever said hey this kid 's a good speaker he can 't focus but he loves walking around and getting people energized no one said get him a coach in speaking 
 they said get me a tutor in what i suck at 
 so as kids
 show these traits and we need to start looking for them i think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers  
 unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say
  lawyer or let 's be a doctor and we 're missing that opportunity because no one ever says hey be an entrepreneur 
 entrepreneurs are people because we have a lot of them in this room who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it 
 and we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen
 we have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of
  and i think if we could get kids to to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial we could change everything in the world that is a problem today  
 every problem that 's out there somebody has the idea for and as a young kid nobody can say it can 't happen because you 're too dumb to realize that you couldn 't figure it out 
 i think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids
 to fish instead of giving them the fish
 the old parable if you
  a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial the ones that show those traits to be like we teach the ones who have science
 gifts to go on in science what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts 
 what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn 't do don 't hit don 't bite don 't swear  
 right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs you know and the school system teaches them to go after things like
  being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot and the media says that it 's really cool if we could go out and
 be a model or a singer or a sports hero like luongo  crosby our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs 
 the reason that i avoided an mba program other than the fact that i couldn 't get into any because i had a sixty one percent average out of high school and then sixty one percent average at the only school in canada that accepted me carlton
  but our mba programs don 't teach kids to be entrepreneurs they teach them to go work in corporations so who 's starting these companies  it 's these random few people 
 even in popular literature the only book i 've ever found and this should be on all of your reading lists
 the only book i 've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is atlas shrugged everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs
  bad people i look at even my family both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs my dad was an entrepreneur both my brother and sister and i all three of us own companies as well  
 and we all decided to start these things because it 's really the only place we fit we didn 't fit in the normal work we couldn 't work for somebody else because we 're too stubborn and we have all these other traits 
 but kids could be entrepreneurs as well i 'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the entrepreneurs ' organization and the young presidents ' organization i just came back from speaking
 in barcelona at the ypo global conference and everyone that i met over there
  's an entrepreneur
 struggled with school i have eighteen out of the nineteen signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed so
 this thing right here is freaking me out it
 's probably why i 'm a little bit panicked right now other than all the caffeine that i 've had and the sugar but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur  attention deficit disorder
  you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease  ted turner 's got it steve jobs has it all three of the founders of netscape had it
 i could go on and on kids you can see these signs in kids and what we 're doing is we 're giving them ritalin and saying don 't be an entrepreneurial type fit into this other system and try to 
  become a student sorry entrepreneurs aren 't students we fast track we figure out the game i stole
  i cheated on exams i hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for thirteen consecutive assignments but as an entrepreneur you don 't do accounting you hire accountants so
 i just figured that out earlier at
 least i can admit i cheated in university most of you won
 't i 'm also quoted  and i told the person who wrote the textbook i 'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian
  and college studies in managerial accounting i 'm chapter eight i open up chapter eight talking about budgeting 
 and i told the author after they did my interview that i cheated in that same course and she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway but
 kids you can see these signs in them the definition of an entrepreneur is a person who organizes operates and assumes the risk of a business venture 
 that doesn 't mean you have to go to an mba program it doesn 't mean you have to get through school it just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut  and we 've heard those things about is it nurture or is it nature
 right is it thing one or thing two what is it  well i don 't think it 's either i think it can be both 
 i was groomed as an entrepreneur  when i was growing up as a young kid  i had no choice because i was taught at a very early young age when my dad realized i wasn 't going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school 
 that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age he groomed us the three of us to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people
  my first little business venture i was seven years old i was in winnipeg and i was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords and i was calling all the dry cleaners in winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers 
 and my mom came into the room and she said where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners 
 and i said let 's go and look in the basement and we went down to the basement  and i opened up this cupboard
  there was about a thousand coat hangers
 that i 'd collected 
 because when i told her i was going out to play with the kids 
 i was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell because i saw her a few weeks before that you could get paid they used to pay you two cents per coat hanger  so 
  i was just like well there 's all kinds of coat hangers  and so i 'll just go get them and i knew she wouldn 't want me to go get them so i just did it anyway 
 that i could actually get a fractional percent of a cent  and people would pay that because it multiplied up at seven years old i figured it out i got three and a half cents
 for a thousand coat hangers  i sold license plate protectors door to door my dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale and at nine years old i walked around in the city of sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door to houses and i remember this one
  i also did some other stuff with these clients i sold newspapers  
 and he wouldn 't buy a newspaper from me ever  but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector 
 and he 's like well we don 't need one and i said but you 've got two cars 
 i 'm nine years old i 'm like but you have two cars and they don 't have license plate protectors and he said i know and i said this car here 's got one license plate that 's all crumpled up and he said yes that 's my wife 's car and i said why don 't we just 
  test one on the front of your wife 's car and see if it lasts longer so i knew there were two cars with two license plates
  on each if i couldn 't sell all four i could at least get one i learned that at a young age i did comic book arbitrage  when i was about ten years old i sold comic books out of
 our cottage on georgian bay  and i would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids and then i would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids  
 but it was obvious to me right buy low sell high you 've got this demand over here that has money don 't try to sell to the poor kids they don 't have cash the rich people do go get some so
 that 's obvious right it 's like a recession so there 's a recession there 's still thirteen trillion dollars circulating in the u s economy go get some of that 
 and i learned that at a young age i also learned don 't reveal your source because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my comics from  
 and he didn 't like the fact that he was paying a lot more  i was forced to get a paper route at
  really want a paper route but at ten my dad said that 's going to be your next business 
 so not only would he get me one but i had to get two and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers  which i did and then i realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money so i would collect the tips
 and get payment  so i would go and collect for all the papers he could just deliver them  because then i realized i could make the money  
 by this point i was definitely not going to be an employee 
 dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop he had all these old automotive parts lying around they had this old brass and copper i asked him what he did with it and he said he just throws it out i said but wouldn 't somebody pay you for 
  that and he goes maybe remember at ten years old so thirty four years ago i saw opportunity in this stuff i saw there was money in garbage  and i was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle and then my dad would drive me on saturdays to a scrap metal recycler
 i built these little pincushions when i was eleven years old in cubs and we made these pin cushions for our moms for mother 's day  and you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside and
 you 'd make these these chairs and i had these little pillows that i would sew up and you could stuff pins in them because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion
  but what i realized was that you had to have options so i actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown and then when i went to the door it wasn 't do you want to buy one it was which color would you like 
 like i 'm ten years old you 're not going to say no to me especially if you have two options you have the brown one or the clear one  
 so i learned that lesson at a young age i learned that manual labor really sucks right 
 like cutting lawns
 is brutal  but because i had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that i realized that recurring revenue
 from one client is amazing
  that if i land this client once and every week i get paid by that person that 's way better than trying to sell one 
 thing to one person because you can 't sell them more  so i love that recurring revenue model i started to learn at a young age remember i was being groomed to do this i was not allowed to have jobs  
 i would caddy i would go to the golf course and and caddy for people
 i realized that there was this one hill on our golf course the 13th hole that had this huge hill and people could never get their bags up it so i would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn 
  't have caddies i would carry their golf bags up to the top and they 'd pay me a dollar meanwhile my friends were working for five hours to haul some guy 's bag around and get paid ten bucks i 'm like that 's stupid because you have to work for five hours that doesn 't make any sense you just figure out a way to make more money faster
 and they 'd give me their orders for the following week and then i 'd just deliver pop and i 'd just charge twice  and i had this captured market you didn 't need contracts  
 you just needed to have a supply and demand and this this audience who bought into you these women weren 't going to go to anybody else because
 they liked me and i kind of figured it out 
 i went and got golf balls from golf courses but everybody else was  looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls i 'm like screw that they 're all in the pond and nobody 's going
  into the pond  so i would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes you just pick them up with both feet you can 't do it on stage  
 you get the golf balls and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you 're done
 you 've got a couple hundred of them  but the problem is that people all didn 't want all the golf balls so i just packaged them i 'm like twelve right i packaged them up three ways i had the pinnacles and ddhs and the really cool ones back then those sold for two dollars each and then i had all the good ones that
  didn 't look crappy they were fifty cents each and then i 'd sell fifty at a time of all the crappy ones and they could use those for practice balls i sold sunglasses when i was in school 
 to all the kids in high school this is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you 're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time  but it paid the bills  
 so i sold lots and lots of sunglasses  then when the school shut me down the school actually called me into the office and told me i couldn 't do it
  went to the gas stations and i sold
 lots of them
 to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers that was cool because then i had retail outlets  
 and i think i was fourteen  then i paid my entire way through first year university at carlton
 by selling wine skins door to door you know that you can hold a 40 ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin  
 so what right  yeah but you know what you stuff that down your shorts when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free everybody bought them
  supply demand big opportunity 
 i also branded it so i sold them for five times the normal cost it had our our university logo on it you know we teach our kids and we buy them games but why don 't we get them games if they 're entrepreneurial kids that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs why don 't you teach them
 not to waste money  i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta because i 'd thrown a penny out in the street and my dad said
  it up he said i work too damn hard for my money  i 'm not going to see you ever waste a penny and i remember that lesson to this day  
 allowances teach kids the wrong habits  allowances by nature are teaching kids to think about a job 
 an entrepreneur doesn 't expect a regular paycheck  allowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck  that 's wrong for
  if you want to raise entrepreneurs what i do with my kids now i 've got two nine and seven is i teach them to walk around the house and the yard looking for stuff that needs to get done come to me and tell me what it is or i 'll come to them and say here 
  's what i need done and then you know what we do we negotiate they go around looking for what it is but then we negotiate on what they 're going to get paid  and then they don 't have a regular check but they have more opportunities to find more stuff and they learn the skill of negotiating and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well  you breed that kind of stuff
  each of my kids has two piggy banks  fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted fifty percent goes in their house account  fifty percent goes in their toy account anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want the 
  fifty percent that goes in their house account every six months goes to the bank  they walk up with me  every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker both my nine and seven year olds have a stock broker already
  those habits to young kids when they don 't even feel the pain yet 
 don 't read them bedtime stories every night  maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories why don 't you sit down with kids and give them four items 
 a red shirt a blue tie  a kangaroo and a laptop and have them tell a story about those four things my kids do that all the time it teaches them to sell it teaches
  them to think on their feet just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it  
 get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk  even if it 's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing  show the kids what bad 
  customers or bad employees look like show them the grumpy employees when you see grumpy customer service point that out to them say by the way that guy 's a crappy employee and say these ones are good ones 
 if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service show them what
  bad customer service looks like 
 we have all these lessons in front of us but we don 't take those opportunities we teach kids to go get a tutor 
 imagine if you actually took all the kids  ' junk that 's in the house right now all the toys that they 've outgrown two years ago and said why don 't we start selling some of this on craigslist and kijiji and they can actually sell 
  it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in they can come into your account or a sub account or whatever but teach them how to fix the price
  guess the price  pull up 
  the photos teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money then the money they get fifty percent goes in their house account fifty percent goes in their toy account my kids love this stuff 
 some of the entrepreneurial traits that you 've got to nurture in kids  attainment tenacity leadership introspection interdependence values all these traits you can find in young kids and you can
  look for that kind of stuff there 's two traits that i want you to also look out for that we don 't
 kind of get out of their system don 't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really really freaking bad 
 the same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression unless it is so clinically brutal man 
 bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease when steve jurvetson and
 jim clark and jim barksdale have all got it and they built netscape imagine if they were given ritalin we wouldn 't have have that stuff
  right al gore really would have had to invented the internet 
 these skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else i 'm not saying don 't
 get kids to want to be lawyers but how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well  because there 's huge opportunities in that i want to close with a quick little video it
 's a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor these guys grasshopper  it 's about kids
  it 's about entrepreneurship  hopefully this inspires you to take what you 've heard from me and do something with it to change the world
