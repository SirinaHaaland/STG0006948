  i 'm sitting next to howard i don 't know howard obviously and he 's going i hope you 're not next
  amazing performance i kind of erased everything in my brain
 to follow that  let me start some place  i 'm interested
 i kind of do the same thing  but i don 't move my body and instead of using human figures
  time and space  
 i work in the mineral world  
 i work with more or less inert matter  
 and i organize it and well  it 's also a bit different because an architect versus  let 's say a dance company
 finally is a negotiation between one 's private world one 's conceptual world the world of ideas
  of aspirations of inventions 
 with the relationship of the exterior world and all the the limitations
 the naysayers because i have to say for my whole career
  if there 's anything that 's been consistent it
 's been that you can 't do it no matter what i 've done what i 've tried to do everybody says it can 't be done  and it 's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas  
 and to be an architect somehow
 you have to negotiate between left and right and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place
 and the the outside world and then make it understood i can start any number of places because this process is also
 i think very different from some of the morning sessions which you had such a kind of very clear  such a lineal idea like the last one
  that i think the creative process in architecture the design process is extremely circuitous it 's labyrinthine  
 it 's calvino 's idea of the quickest way between two points is the
 circuitous line not the straight line  and definitely my life has been part of that 
 i 'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things but basically what we do is we try to give
 coherence to the world we make
  physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process they make cities and those things
 are the reflection of the processes  and the time that they are made and what i 'm doing is attempting to synthesize
 the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material 
 because really all i 'm interested in always as an
  architect is the way things are produced because that 's what i do right  and it 's not based on an a priori notion i have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain 
 and saying this is what it looks like in fact somebody mentioned ewan maybe it was you in your introduction
  wow it doesn 't work that way for me at all i have no interest in that whatsoever  architecture is the beginning of something because it 's if you 're not involved in first principles if you 're not involved in
 the absolute  the beginning of that generative process  it 's cake decoration and i 've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators if anybody 's involved in cake decorations it 's not what i 'm interested
  and so in the formation of things in giving it form 
 in concretizing these things  it starts with some notion of how one organizes  and i 've had for thirty years an interest in
 a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear  and to understand the nature of the final
 result of
  representing the building itself 
 there 's been a continual relationship between inventions which are private 
 and reality  which has been important to me a project which is part of an exhibition in copenhagen ten years ago which was the modeling of a hippocampus 
 the territory of the brain that records short term memory and the documentation of that  the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that
  experience  and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer 
 observing every kilometer a particular object of desire  and then placing that within this and the notion was that i could make an organization not built on normal coherencies  but built on non sequiturs 
 built on randomness  and i 'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion
  of the city an accretional notion of the city and that led to various ideas of organization and then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity 
 of systems  and it 's not any single system that makes the work it 's the relationship it 's the dynamics between the systems which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture
 and those systems could be identified and they could be grouped together and of course today with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping etc we have the mechanisms 
  to understand and to respond to these systems and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that 's all we do we 're producing spaces that accommodate human activity  and what
  'm interested in is not the styling of that  but the relationship of that as it enhances
 that activity  
 and that directly connects to ideas of city making this is a project that we just finished in penang for a very very large city project that came directly out of this process 
 which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it 
  again enormous enormous competition on the hudson river and in new york that we were asked to do three years ago  which uses these processes and what you 're looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a a methodology
 that uses notions of these multiple forces that deals with the the enormity of the problem the complexity of the problem  when we 're designing cities at larger
  and larger aggregates because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the the development aggregate and as the aggregates get larger we require 
  more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems  
  again a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated very 
 organisms  and then also was working with broad strategies  in this case we only used
 fifteen of the sixty acres of land and the forty five acres was a park and would become the legacy
 of the olympic village
  and it would become the second largest park in the boroughs etc  
 its position of course in the middle of manhattan it 's on hunter 's point  
 and then the broader ideas of city making start having direct influences on architecture 
 on the elements that make up the broader scheme  the buildings themselves 
 and start guiding us 
 architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place and so i
 i can start this discussion in any number of places and i 've chosen three or four to talk about
  and it has also to do with an interest in
 the vast
 kind of territory that architecture touches  it literally is is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base 
  it doesn 't somehow have a connective tissue to this is jim dine  and it
 's the absence of presence  etc  it 's the clothing the skin without the presence of the character it became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work and
 it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface  and
 it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very kind of complex space and the idea was the
  relationship of the space which was made up of the fold of the of the image and the dialectic or the
 the conflict between the figuration and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space which were in dialog  
 and it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things  and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we
 flattened out surfaces
  and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations and this was the first prototype in korea as we
 're dealing with a dynamic envelope  and then the same characteristic of the fabric it has a material identity and it 's translucent and it
 's porous  and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is and that turned right away into another project this is the caltrans building in los
  angeles  and now we 're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated 
 again it 's a very very simple notion  if you look at most buildings what you look at is the building the facade and it is the building and all of a sudden we 're kind of moving away and we 're separating the skin from the body and that 's going to lead to broader performance criteria which i 'm going to talk about in a minute and you 're looking at how it
  middle of los angeles right across from city hall and as it moves it takes pieces of the earth with it it bends up it 's part of a sign system which was part of the
 kind of legacy of los angeles the 
  signing etc  and then it allows one to penetrate the work itself  it 's transparent
  and it allows you to understand i think what is always the most interesting thing in any building which is the actual constructional processes that make it and it
 's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work which is not occupied 
 because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it 's separated from function  and this is an area that allows for that and then the skin starts transforming into other
  we 're using light as a building material in this case we 're working with keith sonnier in new york and we 're making this large outside room which is possible in los angeles and which is very much reflective of the 
 urban the contemporary urban environments that you would find in shibuya or you 'd find in mexico city or sao paulo etc that have to do with activating the city
 over a longer span of time and that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in los angeles  
 transparency and an image which may be closest talks about the
 the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material 
 well that immediately turned into something much broader and as a scope and again we 're looking at an early sketch
 where i 'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower
  tower this is a building in san francisco which is under construction 
 and now it turned into something much much broader as a problem  and it has to do with performance this will be the first building in the united states that took
 well i can 't say it took the air conditioning out it 's a hybrid  i wanted a pure thing and i can 't get it it 's a wrong attitude actually because the hybrid is probably more interesting but we took the air conditioning
  there 's some air conditioning left in the base but the skin now moves on hydraulics  it forces air through through a venturi force if there 's no wind it adjusts continually  
 and we removed the air conditioning huge huge thing 
 half a million dollars a year delta
  ten of these it 's just under a million square feet eight hundred and some thousand square feet ten of these would power sausalito the delta on this and so now what we 're looking at as the projects
  with broader problems that they expand the capabilities in terms of their
  basic sense  and then well he was probably looking at this this is nazca  this is seven hundred years ago the most amazing 
 land sculptures they 're just totally
 incredible  and that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw how we work  this is the first sketch of a high school in pomona
  a model a conceptual kind of idea  and it 's the reshaping of the earth to make it occupiable so it puts two hundred thousand square feet of stuff
 that make a high school work in the surface of that earth there it is modeled as it was
 developing into a piece of work and there it is again  as it 's starting to get resolved tectonically  and then there 's the school 
 we 're interested in participating with education 
 i have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates x y and z function what i 'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people it demands some sort of notion of inquiry
 because it 's a system that 's developed not sculpturally it
 's an idea that started from my first discussion it has to do with a broad consistent logic  and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building
  there 's an overt at least there 's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because i was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem 
 as one would understand that and the second project that was just finished in los angeles that uses some of the same ideas it uses landscape as a major idea then again we 're doing the headquarters for 
  noaa national oceanographic and atmospheric agency outside of washington in maryland 
  satellites zipping around at
 plus or minus one hundred miles and the site 's in red  and
 what we really want to do well  the architects if there are architects out there this is the laugier hut  this is the primitive hut that 's been around for so long and what we what we wanted to do is really build this 
 because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world and we wanted them to look down
  their satellite how they see their own site that eight acre site  and we wanted nothing left we wanted it to stay green there 's actually three baseball fields on it right now and they 're going to stay there we put one piece directly north south and it holds the the dishes at the ears right
 and then right below that the processing  and the mission lift and the mission control room  and all the other spaces are underground  
 and what you look at is an aircraft carrier that 's performance driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes  and that the building itself is
 in the lower portion 
 broken up by a series of courts and it 's five acres of uninterrupted horizontal space for their administrative offices  and then that in turn  propelled us to 
  look at larger scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue 
  the ecb actually coop himmelblau in vienna just won this project where the building was separated into a series of
 landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue
 of of a park which is parallel to the the river and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric the social cultural and the landscape
 recreational fabric of the city and the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing but something that 's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time 
 and a project that was realized in in austria  the hooper bank which again used this idea of connecting typology the traditional buildings and
 morphology or the relationship of the development of land as an idea into a complex which is a piece of a city where we can see part of
  it is literally just this augmenting this movement of the land that 's a very simple idea  of just lifting it up and occupying it and other parts are much more energetic and intense and talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make
 that have to do with putting a series of systems together  and then where part of it is in the ground part of it is is oppositional lifts one enters the building as it
 and it becomes part of the idea  and then the skin the edges of this all promote the dynamic the movement of the building as a series of
 seismic shifts  geologic shifts right  and it makes for event space
 and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior and those interiors again are promoting transparency for the workplace  which has been a continual interest of ours
  and then again in a more kind of traditional setting this is a graduate student housing in toronto  and it 's
 very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city  the main idea was the gateway where it breaks the site and the building occupies both the public space and the private space 
 and it 's that territory
 of
 it 's this thing  i visited the site
  many times and everybody kind of you can see this from two kilometers away it 's an exact center of the street and the whole notion is to engage the public to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city 
 and finally one of the most interesting projects it 's a courthouse  and what i want to talk about this is the supreme court of course and
  dealing with michael hogan the chief justice of oregon you could not proceed without making this negotiation
 between one 's own values and the relationship of the character you 're working with and how he understands the court because i 'm showing him of course corbusier 
 at at savoy which is one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight which is the beginning of modern architecture  well  then we get to this image and this is where the project started 
  interested
 in the phenomenon that 's taking place in here 
 and really what we 're talking about is constructing reality  
 and i 'm a character that 's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there 's no such thing as nature any more nature is gone nature in the 19th century sense 
 alright nature is only a cultural edifice today  right we construct it and we construct those ideas
 and then of course  this one our governor at the moment  and
 we we spent some time with conan  believe it or not and then that led us to kind of the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic architectural and it forced us to talk about
 notions of how we work and the dynamics of that  and what other sources of the work is  and it led us to the project
  absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of
 the traditional courthouse you 'll find a stair that 's the same length as the supreme court here 's a piano nobile which is a device used in the renaissance  
 the courts were made of that the skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated
 stonework  but which were embedded with fragments of the constitution which were part of the little process all set on a plinth
 that defined it from the community thank you so much
