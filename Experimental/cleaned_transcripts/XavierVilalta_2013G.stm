  my work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment
 where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions  today i brought two recent projects as an example of this
  both projects are in emerging countries one in ethiopia and another one in tunisia  and also they have in common
 that the different analyses from different perspectives
 becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture 
 the first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in ethiopia 's capital city addis ababa  and this
 is the type of building we were shown as
  an example to my team and myself of what we had to design at first the first thing i thought was i want to run away 
 after seeing a few of these buildings there are many in the city
 we realized that they have three very big points first these buildings they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things
  second they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside  
 and then you need a lot of cooling in a city where this shouldn 't happen because they have really mild weather
 that ranges from twenty to twenty five degrees the whole year  and third
 is that their image has nothing to do with africa and
  a pity in a place
 that has such rich culture and traditions 
 also during our first visit to ethiopia i was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open air structure
 where thousands of people they go and buy things every day from small vendors  and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors
 to create activity  so i thought this is
  but the question was how we could do a multistory contemporary building with these principles  the next challenge was when we looked at the site that is in
 a really growing area of the city where most of these buildings that 
  were not there  and it 's also between two parallel streets that don 't have any connection for hundreds of meters  so the first thing
 we did was to create a connection between these two streets  putting all the entrances of the building  and this extends with an inclined atrium
 that creates an open air space in the building that self protects itself with its own shape
 from the sun and the rain 
 and around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops that change in each floor because of the shape of the void 
 i also thought how to close the building  and i really wanted to find a solution that would
  respond to the local climate conditions 
 and i started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in 
 and also the light but in a filtered way  and then the inspiration came from
 these beautiful patterns of the ethiopian women 's dresses that they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade and we are building that with these
  these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air
 and the light in a controlled way inside the building  and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building
 to light up the building at night with these ideas
 it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like
  we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell  
 and also that the idea of the facade
 was much much cheaper not only because of the material compared with the glass but also because we didn 't need to have air conditioning anymore  
 so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project  
 and the first implementation was to think about how we
  make the building self sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day  so we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof  
 and then under those panels
 we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis  
 and these porches on the roof all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside
  hopefully by the beginning of next year because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction  the second example is a master plan
 of two thousand apartments and facilities in the city of tunis  and for doing such a big project  the biggest project i 've ever designed 
 i really needed to understand the city of tunis but also its surroundings
  during that analysis i paid special attention to the medina that is this 
  structure that used to be closed by a wall  opened by twelve different gates  connected by almost straight lines  when i went to the site  the first
 design operation we did
 was to extend the existing streets  creating twelve initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in barcelona
  other cities in europe
 with these courtyards on top of that we selected some strategic points
 reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines  and this modified this initial pattern  
 and the last operation was to think about the cell  the small cell of the project like the apartment  
 as an essential part of the master plan  and for that i thought what would be the best orientation
 in the mediterranean climate for an apartment  and it
  because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house
 and then a natural ventilation 
 so we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction  
 and this is the result that is almost like a combination of the european block and the arab city it has these blocks with courtyards  and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians  
 and also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor and
  it also reinforces this idea of the gates  the volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments
 and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood and in the courtyards there are the different facilities such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by a series of commercial [ spaces ] that bring activity to the ground floor
  which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction and it 's where all the neighbors they can go up and socialize  and do activities such as having a two kilometer run in the morning jumping from one building to another 
 these two examples  they have a common approach in the design process  and also they are in emerging countries where you can see the
  these cities the impact of architecture in people 's lives of today and tomorrow
 changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow for this reason i see even more importance to look at architecture
 finding simple but affordable solutions
 that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people  thank you very much
