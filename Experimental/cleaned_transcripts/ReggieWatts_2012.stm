  that 's one of the things that i enjoy most about this convention
 it 's not so much as so little has to do with what everything is 
 but it is within 
 to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves
  there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living 
 common knowledge  but important nonetheless 
 as we face fear in these times and fear is all around us we also have
  it 's hard to imagine or measure the background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis 
 but we feel as though
 there are times when a lot of us you know what i 'm saying
  and i hope you guys dig it it 's a song about people and sasquatches and
 other french science stuff that 's french science okay here we go
  you could use as many of those things
 and the computer models no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use 
 are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions 
 four years ago i worked
 with a few people at the brookings institute and i arrived at a conclusion
  not just any day  but it is a day  it will get here there 's no question  and the important thing to remember
 is that this simulation is a good one 
 it 's believable it 's tactile you can reach out things are solid you can move objects from one area to another
  can feel your body you can say i 'd like to go over to this location and you can move this mass of molecules through the air
 over to another location at will 
 that 's something you live inside of every day  
 now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding we enter into a new era of science in which we feel
 nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves  comporary or 
 will figuratively figure into the folding of our 
 and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from
  as i say before the last piece feel not as though it is a sphere we live on rather
 an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin 
 laughter once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes it will be plain to see
  remember everything you are it 's more important to realize
 the negative space 
 as music is only the division of space it is the space we are listening to divided as such which gives us the information in comparison to something other
 that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be
  this is a fun one it goes like this
  for the last piece i 'd like to do this one goes
 very similar to this i hope you guys recognize it here we go 
  thank you enjoy the rest
