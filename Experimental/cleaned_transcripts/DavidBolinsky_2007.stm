  i come from a slightly different point of view i 've been watching since i grew up the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences and while these are both wonderful things in their own
  right they both have
 very wonderful things going for them truth and beauty as as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date
  they are things you can worship they are ideals that are powerful  they are irreducible they are unique  they are useful sometimes often a long time after the fact  and you can actually roll some of the pictures now because
 i don 't want to look at me on the on the screen 
 truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences  they are
  things that describe
 beauty in a way that is often
 only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed if you look at the math e = mc 
  squared if you look at the cosmological constant where there 's an anthropic ideal where you see
  that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe these are things that are really difficult to understand and what i 've tried to do since i had my training 
  as a medical illustrator since i was taught animation by my father who was a sculptor and my visual mentor
 by using animation by using pictures by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth 
 and can be taught and can be understood students today are often
 but the way they 're taught is is compartmentalized and it 's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident it 
  's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone
  so we have an opportunity to really open up education and i had a telephone call from robert lue at harvard in the molecular and cellular biology department a couple of years ago 
 he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing
 to
 really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard so we embarked on a project
 that would explore the cell that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology
  so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on they could have a mental image of the cell as a
 large  bustling  hugely complicated
 city that 's occupied by 
 and these
  really are at the heart of life these micro machines which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over
 powerful  precise  accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids  and these 
 power how a cell moves  they power how a cell replicates  they power
  they power our minds and so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation
 that would be the centerpiece of biovisions at harvard  which is
 a website that harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will
 in addition to all the textual information in addition to all the didactic stuff put everything together visually so that these students would have
  have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty  
 and be able to study with this view in mind  so that their imaginations would be sparked so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able 
  to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out really how life works so we
  out by
 looking at how these molecules are put together we worked with a theme which is you 've got
 macrophages that are streaming down a capillary and they 're touching the surface of the capillary wall  and they 're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary
  are given this information that there 's an inflammation somewhere outside where they can 't see and sense but they get the information that causes them to stop causes 
  them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape  
  and databank
 models of the atomically accurate
 molecules and figure out how they moved and figure out what they did  and figure out how to do this in a way
 that was truthful
 in that it imparted what was going on  but not so truthful that the that the compact crowding in a cell would
 would prevent the vista
  from happening and so what i 'm going to show you is a three minute reader 's digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced  
 it 's an ongoing project that 's going to go another four or five years 
 and i want you to look at this and see the the paths that the cell manufactures these little
 walking machines they 're called kinesins that take these huge loads
  loads that would that would challenge an ant in relative size  run the the movie  please
  but these machines that power the inside of the cells
 are really quite amazing  and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines
 interact with each other  they pass information to each other  they cause different things to happen inside the cell and the
  cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly from information that 's brought from the nucleus by
 molecules that read the genes no life from the smallest life to everybody here would be possible without these little 
 in fact it would really in the absence of these machines have made the attendance here chris really quite sparse
  this is the fedex delivery guy of the cell 
  and he pulls a sack that 's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it 's needed in the cell whether it 's to a membrane whether it 's to an organelle whether it 's to build something or repair something 
 and each of us has about one hundred thousand of these things running around right now inside each one of your one hundred trillion cells 
 so no matter how lazy you feel you 're not really
  so what i want you to do when you go home is think about this and think about how powerful our cells are and think about some of the things that that we 're learning about cellular mechanics 
 once we figure out all that 's going on and believe me we know almost a percent of what 's going on once we figure out what 's going on we 're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health with what we do
  with future generations and how long we 're going to live  and hopefully we 'll be able to use this to discover more truth and more beauty
