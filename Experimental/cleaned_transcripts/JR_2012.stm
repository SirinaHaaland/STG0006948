  twelve years ago  i was in the street writing my name to say i exist then i went to taking photos of people
 to paste them on the street to say they exist from the suburbs of paris to the wall of israel and palestine
 the rooftops of kenya to the favelas of rio  
 paper and glue as easy as that i asked a question last year  can art change the world  
 well let me tell you in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year
  because the arab spring is still spreading the eurozone has collapsed 
 what else
  the occupy movement found a voice and i still have to speak english constantly so
 there has been a lot of change 
 so when i had my ted wish last year  i said look i 'm going to switch my concept you are going to take the photos 
 you 're going to send them to me 
 i 'm going to print them and send them back to you then you 're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to
  place your own statement  this is inside out one hundred thousand posters have been printed this year  
 those are the kind of posters let me show you
 and we keep sending more every day this is the size just a regular piece of paper with a little
 bit of ink on it this one was from haiti  
 when i launched my wish
  last year  hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us  but i say it has to be
 under the conditions i 've always worked  no credit  no logos  no sponsoring 
 a week later a handful of people were there ready to rock and empower the people on the ground who wanted to change the world  
 these are the people
 i want to talk about to you today  two weeks
 after my speech in tunisia 
 hundreds of portraits were made 
 and they pasted [ over ] every single portrait of the dictator [ with ] their own photos  boom
  this is what happened slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity
 in the country they really make inside out their own project  
 actually that photo was pasted in a police station and what you see on the ground
 are id cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police 
 russia  chad wanted to fight against homophobia in russia he went with his friends in front of
 every russian embassy in europe
 and stood there with the photos to say we have rights they used inside out as a platform for protest  
 karachi pakistan  sharmeen is actually here  she organized a tedx action out there
 and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town and i want to thank her today
  north dakota  standing rock nation in this turtle island
 from the dakota lakota tribe wanted to show that the native americans are still here 
 the seventh generation are still fighting for their rights he pasted up portraits all over his reservation and he 's here also today  
 each time
 i get a wall
  in new york i use his photos
 to continue spreading the project 
 you 've heard of the border one of the most dangerous borders in the world  
 monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border 
 do you know what it takes to do this people energy make the glue organize the
  team it was amazing  while in iran at the same time abololo of course a nickname
 has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government 
 i don 't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action 
 there are tons of school projects twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools
 education is so essential  kids just make photos in a class the teacher receives them they paste them on the school here they even got the help of the firemen 
 there should be even more schools doing this kind of project 
 of course
 we wanted to go back
 to israel and palestine  so we went there with a truck  this is a photobooth truck  you go on the back of that truck it takes your photo  thirty seconds later
 take it from the side you 're ready to rock thousands of people use them
 and each of them signs up for a two state peace solution
 and then walk in the street this is march the four hundred and fifty thousand march beginning of september they were all holding their photo as a statement on the other side
 people were wrapping up streets  buildings  it 's everywhere come on don 't tell me that people aren 't ready for peace out there 
 these projects took thousands of actions in one year  making hundreds of thousands of people participating  
 creating millions of views 
 this is the biggest
 global art participatory project that 's going on so back to the question can art change the world
  maybe not in one year  that 's the beginning  but maybe we should change the question can art change people 's lives  
 from what i 've seen this year  yes 
 and you know what it 's just the beginning  let 's turn the world inside out together thank you
