  those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier so
 when i had the chance to give the world 's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity it was incredible and i want to tell
  i first met him through the archon x prize for genomics it 's a competition we 're holding the second x prize for the first team to sequence one hundred human genomes in ten days  
 we have something called the genome one hundred one hundred individuals we 're sequencing as part of that craig venter chairs that event and i met professor hawking and he said his dream was to travel into space 
 and i said i can 't take you there but i can i can take you into weightlessness into zero g and he said on the spot
  yes well the only way to experience zero g on earth is actually with parabolic flight weightless flight  
 you take an airplane you fly over the top you 're weightless for twenty five seconds  
 come back down you weigh twice as much  you do it again and again you can get eight ten minutes of weightlessness how nasa 's trained their astronauts for so long  
 we set out to do this it took us eleven years to become operational  and we announced that we were going to fly stephen hawking we had
  one government agency and one company aircraft operator say you 're crazy don 't do that you 're going kill the guy and
 he wanted to go  we worked hard to get all the permissions and six months later  
 we sat down at kennedy space center  we had a press conference we announced our intent
 to do one
  three parabolas well
  we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this and what he said for me was very moving he said life on earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster i think the human race doesn 't have a future if it doesn 't go into space 
 i therefore want to encourage public interest in space 
 we took him out to the kennedy space center  
 up inside the nasa
  vehicle into the back of the zero g airplane  
 we had about twenty people who made donations we raised $ one hundred and fifty thousand in donations for children 's charities who flew with us a few tedsters here  
 we set up a whole er we had four emergency room doctors and two
  of his blood his heart rate his blood pressure  we had everything all set in case of an emergency god knows you don 't want to hurt this world renowned expert 
 we took off from the shuttle landing facility where the shuttle takes off and lands  
 and my partner byron lichtenberg and i
 carefully suspended him into zero g once he was there [ we ] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like and
  after that first parabola  you know the doc said everything is great he was smiling  and we said go so we did a a second parabola 
 and a third applause
  we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did  
 and we did a fourth  and a fifth and a sixth and a seventh and an eighth and this man does not look like a 
  man he was so happy  
 we are living on a precious jewel  and it 's during our lifetime that we 're moving off this planet  please join us in this epic adventure  thank you so much
