  still a student i got a traveling fellowship
 to study housing in north america we traveled the country  we saw public housing
  in all major cities new york philadelphia 
 those who have no choice lived there  and then we traveled from suburb to suburb and i came back thinking  
 we 've got to reinvent the apartment building 
 there has to be another way of doing this we can 't sustain suburbs so let 's design a building
 which gives
 the qualities of a house to each unit habitat
 would be
 all about gardens contact with nature  streets instead of corridors  we prefabricated it so we would achieve economy  
 and there it is
 almost fifty years later  it 's a very desirable place to live in it 's now a heritage building
  i made my first trip to china  it was the cultural revolution  
 we traveled the country  met with architects and planners  this is beijing then 
 not a single high rise building in beijing or shanghai  shenzhen didn 't even exist as a city
  there were hardly any cars  thirty years later  this is beijing today 
 this is hong kong  
 if you 're wealthy you live there if you 're poor you live there  but high density it is and it 's not just asia so paulo you can travel
  and with it comes congestion  and we lose mobility and so on and so forth  
 so a few years ago we decided to go back and rethink habitat 
 could we make it more affordable could we actually achieve this quality of life in the densities
  and we realized it 's basically about light it 's about sun it 's about nature  it 's about 
 can we open up the surface of the building so that it has more contact with the exterior  we came up with a number of models economy models  cheaper to build and more compact 
 membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens
 and then we decided to take new york as a test case and we looked at lower manhattan  
 and we mapped all the building area in manhattan on the left
 is manhattan today  blue for housing  red for office buildings  retail 
 on the right we reconfigured it the office buildings form the base  and then rising
  above are apartments there 's a street in the air on the 25th level a community street it 's permeable 
 there are gardens and open spaces for the community 
 almost every unit with its own private garden  and community space all around  and most important permeable 
 open it does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city and light
  permeates everywhere  and in the last two or three years we 've actually been for the first time  realizing the quality of life of habitat
 in real life projects across asia  this in qinhuangdao
 in china middle income housing where there is a bylaw that every apartment
 must receive three hours of sunlight
 that 's measured in the winter solstice  
 and under construction in singapore  again middle income housing gardens community streets and parks and so on and so forth  
 and colombo  
 and i want to touch on one more issue which is the design of the public realm a hundred years after we 've begun
  building with tall buildings we are yet to understand
 how the tall high rise building becomes a building block in making a city in creating the public realm 
 in singapore  we had an opportunity ten million square feet extremely high density 
 taking the concept of outdoor and indoor  promenades and parks integrated
  with intense urban life 
 so they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces and you move from one to the other  and there is contact with nature  
 and most relevantly at every level of the structure public gardens and open space on the roof of the podium  climbing up the towers
  and finally on the roof the sky park two and a half acres  jogging paths restaurants  and
 the world 's longest swimming pool  
 and that 's all i can tell you in five minutes
