  this chap here he thinks he can tell you the future his name is nostradamus although here the sun have made him look a little bit like sean connery laughter and
 like most of you i suspect i don 't really believe
  people can see into the future i don 't believe in precognition and every now and then you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future and that 's probably because it was a fluke and we only hear 
 about the flukes and about the freaks we don 't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong
  and in medicine and in this environment it costs lives
 so firstly thinking just about precognition as it turns out just last year a researcher called daryl bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate 
  students and this was published in a peer reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said okay well fair enough but i think that 's a fluke that 's a freak because i know that if i did a study where i found
  no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers it probably wouldn 't get published in a journal
 and in fact we know that that 's true because
 several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study and when they submitted it to the exact same journal the journal said no
  not interested in publishing replication we 're not interested in your negative data
 so this is already evidence of how in the academic literature we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted
 but it doesn 't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology it also happens in for example cancer research
 so in march two thousand and twelve just one month ago some
  researchers reported in the journal nature how they had tried to replicate fifty three different basic science studies
 looking at potential treatment targets in cancer
 and out of those fifty three studies they were only able to successfully replicate six forty seven out of those fifty three were
 and they say in their discussion that this is very likely because
 freaks get published
 people will do lots and lots and lots of different studies and the occasions when it works they will publish and the ones where it doesn 't work they won 't and their first recommendation of how to fix this problem
 because it is a problem because it sends us all down blind alleys their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their
  negative results in public
 but it doesn 't just happen
 in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research
 it also happens in the very real flesh and blood of academic medicine
 so in one thousand nine hundred and eighty
 some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide
  and this was an anti arrhythmic drug a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms and the idea was after people have had a heart attack they 're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms this will increase the chances of them surviving
 early on its development they did a very small trial just under a hundred patients fifty patients got lorcainide and of those patients ten died
 another fifty patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient and only one of them died so they rightly
  regarded this drug as a failure and its commercial development was stopped and because its commercial development was stopped this trial was never published
 unfortunately over the course of the next five ten years
 other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks these drugs were brought to market they were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common
  thing
 and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal
 over one hundred thousand people died unnecessarily in america
 from the prescription of anti arrhythmic drugs
  ninety three
 the researchers who did that one thousand nine hundred and eighty study that early study published a mea culpa an apology to the scientific community in which they said when we carried out our study in one thousand nine hundred and eighty we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group
 was an effect of chance
 the development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons and this study was never published it 's now a good example of publication bias that 's the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost gets
  lost gets unpublished is left missing in action and they say the results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead
 now these are stories from basic science these are stories from twenty thirty years ago
 the academic publishing environment is very different now there are academic journals like trials the open access journal
  which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result but this problem
 of negative results that go missing in action
 is still very prevalent in fact it 's so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence based medicine
 so this is a drug called reboxetine and this is a drug that i myself have prescribed it 's an antidepressant and
  i 'm a very nerdy doctor so i read all of the studies that i could on this drug i read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo and i read the other three studies that were 
  published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant and because this patient hadn 't done well on those other antidepressants i thought well reboxetine is just as good it 's one to try
  against a dummy placebo sugar pill one of them was positive and that was published but six of them were negative and they were left unpublished
 three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good and they were published but three times as many patients worth of data was collected 
 which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments and those trials were not published
  i felt misled
 now you might say well that 's an extremely unusual example and i wouldn 't want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry picking and selective referencing that i 'm accusing other people of
 but it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very very well studied so here is one example of how you approach it the classic model is you get a bunch of studies where you know that they 've been conducted and completed and then you go and see if they
  been published anywhere in the academic literature so this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a fifteen year period by the fda they took all 
  of the trials which were submitted to the fda as part of the approval package so that 's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs because we can never know if we have those but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization and then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer reviewed
 academic literature and this is what they found it was pretty much a fifty fifty split half of these trials were positive half of them were negative in reality
 but when they went to look for these trials in the peer reviewed academic literature what they found was a very different picture
 only three of the negative trials were published
 but all but one of the positive trials were published
  if we just flick back and forth between those two you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality
 and what doctors patients commissioners of health services and academics were able to see in the peer reviewed academic literature we were misled and this is a systematic flaw
 in the core of medicine
 in fact there have been so many
  studies conducted on publication bias now
 over a hundred that they 've been collected in a systematic review published in two thousand and ten that took every single study on publication bias that they could find
 publication bias affects every field of medicine
 about half of all trials on average go missing in action and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings
  this is a cancer at the core of evidence based medicine
 if i flipped a coin one hundred times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses i could make it look as if i had a coin that always came up heads 
 but that wouldn 't mean that i had a two headed coin that would mean that i was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with
  but this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence based medicine and to me this is
 research misconduct
 if i conducted one study and i withheld half of the data points from that one study you would rightly accuse me essentially of research fraud
 and yet for some reason if somebody conducts ten studies but only publishes the five that give the result that
  they want we don 't consider that to be research misconduct
 and when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers academics industry sponsors journal editors for some reason we find it more 
  acceptable but the effect on patients is damning
  is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling and we 've stockpiled tamiflu in panic
 in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza
 complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death laughter
  now when the cochrane systematic reviewers
 were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether tamiflu actually did this or not they found that several of those trials were unpublished the results 
  were unavailable to them and when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means through freedom of information act requests through harassing various different organizations what they found was inconsistent
  that have the the best possible rendition of the information they were told they weren 't allowed to have them and if you want to read the full correspondence
 and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company you can see that written up in this week 's edition of plos medicine
 and the most staggering thing of all of this to me is that
  not only is this a problem not only do we recognize that this is a problem
 but we 've had to suffer fake fixes we 've had people pretend that this is a problem that 's been fixed first of all we had trials registers and everybody said oh it 's okay we 'll get everyone to register 
  their trials they 'll post the protocol they 'll say what they 're going to do before they do it and then afterwards we 'll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published but people didn 't bother to use those registers and so then the
  international committee of medical journal editors came along and they said oh well we will hold the line we won 't publish any journals we won 't publish any trials unless they 've been registered before they began
 but they didn 't hold the line in two thousand and eight a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the icmje
 weren 't properly registered and a
 quarter of them weren 't registered at all and then finally the fda amendment act was passed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts a trial must post the results of that trial within 
  one year and in the bmj in the first edition of january two thousand and twelve you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling and it turns out that only one in five have done so
 so this is a disaster
 we cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe
 if we do not have access to all of the information
 and this is not a difficult problem to fix
 we need to force people
 to publish all trials conducted in humans
 including the older trials because the fda amendment act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after two thousand and eight and i don 't know
  world it is in which we 're only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years
 we need to publish all trials in humans including the older trials for all drugs in current use and you need to tell everyone you know
 that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed
 thank you very much
