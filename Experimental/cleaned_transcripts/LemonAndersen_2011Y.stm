 my suede starters jacket says raiders on the back  i 'm stylin ' smilin ' lookin ' real
  because it ain 't about being heard just being seen my leather adidas baseball cap matches my fake gucci backpack ain
 't nobody who looks as good as me  
 but this costs money it sure ain 't free  and i gots no job no money at all but it 's easy to steal all this from the mall parents say i shouldn 't but i knows i should 
 got to do what i can to make sure i look good and
  guess it makes me feel special inside  
 when i 'm wearing fresh gear i don 't have to hide  and i really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a 10 cent balloon but security is tight at all the shops every day there are more 
 and more cops my crew is laughing at me because i 'm wearing old gear school 's almost over  summer is near  and i 'm sportin ' torn jordans

 4th near the park brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks ' hey homes where you get them nik 's ' i says to myself ' yeah i
 likes ' em i likes ' they were q tip white bright and blinding my eyes the red emblem of michael looked as if it could fly  not one spot of dirt the airs were brand new had
  my pistol and knew just what to do  waited until it was just the right time followed him very closely behind he made a left turn on houston i pulled out my gun and i said
  gimme them jordans ' and the punk tried to run 
 took off fast didn 't get far i fired ' pow '
 fool fell between two parked cars he was coughing  crying blood spilled on the street  and i snatched them air jordans off of his feet  
 while laying there dying all he could say was please man don 't take my air jordans away you 'd think he 'd be worried about staying alive
 as i took off with his sneakers there was tears in his eyes 
 very next day i bopped into school with my brand new air jordans man i was cool  i killed to get ' em but hey i don 't care 
 because now i needs a new jacket to wear
  the last fifteen years
 that i have been performing 
 all i ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world  
 see it wasn 't enough for me to write a book 
 it wasn 't enough for me to join a slam competition and while those things hold weight it wasn 't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad 
 the hunger and thirst was and still
  remains how do i get people who hate poetry
 to love me 
 because i 'm an extension of my work  and if they love me then they will love my work and if they love my work then they will love poetry 
 and if they love poetry then i will have done my job  which is to transcend it to the world
  i found the answer in principles
 in a master  spoken word artist named reg e gaines who wrote the famous poem please don 't take my air jordans 
 and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room  and i read him one of my pieces and you know what he told me 
 yo ' wack
  you know what the problem is with you homie you don 't read other people 's poetry 
 and you don 't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration 
 laughter now he kept on rambling
 about poetry and styles and nuyorican friday nights now i could have quit  i should have quit  i mean i thought poetry was just
  actually have to have creative control  so instead of quitting 
 i followed him everywhere 
 when he was writing a broadway show i would be outside of the door  i would wake him up at like six thirty in the morning to ask him who 's the best poet
 i remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because
  printed out thesis
 on a poet named etheridge knight
 and the oral nature of poetry and from that point  reggie stopped becoming the best to me because what etheridge knight taught me
 was that i could make
  my words sound like music 
 even my small ones 
 the monosyllables the ifs  ands buts whats the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear
  and from then on i started chasing etheridge knight i wanted to know which poet he read  and i landed on a poem called
  that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be broadway baby  
 and from that point  i learned how to pull the mic away
 and attack the poetry with my body  but that wasn 't the biggest lesson i ever learned the biggest lesson i learned
 was many years later when i went to beverly hills and i ran into a
  talent agent who looked at me up and down and said i don 't look like i have any experience to be working in this business
