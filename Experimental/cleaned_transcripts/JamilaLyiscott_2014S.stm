  a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells and announced
 that i 'm articulate which means that
  when it comes to enunciation and diction i don 't even think of it cause
 im articulate 
 so when my professor asks a question and my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion theres no misdirected intention pay attention cause
 im articulate
 so when my father asks wha kinda ting is dis 
 my articulate answer never goes amiss i say father this is the impending problem at hand and when im on the block
  switch it up just because i can so when my boy says whats good with you son i just say i jus fall out wit dem people but i done 
 and sometimes in class i might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask yo  
 why dese books neva be about my peoples yes i have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals because
 but who controls articulation 
 because the english language is a multifaceted oration subject to indefinite transformation now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken english but im here to tell you
  that even articulate americans sound foolish to the british so when my professor comes on the block and says hello i stop him and say  noooo youre being inarticulate
 the proper way is to say whats good now you may think thats too hood thats not cool but im here to tell you that even our language has rules so when mommy mocks me and says 
 i say mommy no that sentence is not following the law never does the word
  go before a present participle
 thats simply the principle of this english if i had the vocal capacity i would sing this from every mountaintop from every suburbia and every hood cause the only god 
 of language is the one recorded in the genesis of this world saying it is good so i may not always come before you with excellency of speech but do not judge me by my language and assume that im too ignorant to teach cause i speak
  sometimes im consistent with my language now then switch it up so i dont bore later sometimes i fight back two tongues while i use the other one in the classroom and when i mistakenly mix them up i feel 
  crazy like im cooking in the bathroom i know
 that i had to borrow your language because mines was stolen but you cant expect me to speak your history wholly
 while mines is broken these words are spoken by someone who is simply fed up with the eurocentric ideals of this season and the reason i speak a composite 
  version of your language is because mines was raped away along with my history i speak broken english so the profusing gashes can remind us that
  current state is not a mystery im so tired
 of the negative images that are driving my people mad so unless youve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad im so sick of this nonsensical 
  racial disparity so dont call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity as much
 let there be no confusion let there be no hesitation this is not a promotion of ignorance this is a linguistic celebration
 thats why i put tri lingual on my last job application
 i can help to diversify your consumer market is all i wanted them to know and when they call me for the interview ill be more than happy to show that i can say whats good
