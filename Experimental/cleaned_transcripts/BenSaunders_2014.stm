  in the oasis of intelligentsia
 that is ted i stand here before you this evening as an expert in dragging heavy stuff around
  i 've been leading polar expeditions for most of my adult life  and last month  my teammate tarka l 'herpiniere and i finished
 the most ambitious expedition
 i 've ever attempted in fact it feels like i 've been transported straight here from four months in the middle of nowhere  mostly grunting and swearing  
 straight to the ted stage so you can imagine that 's a transition that hasn 't been entirely seamless one of the interesting
 side effects seems to be that my short term memory is entirely shot so
 i 've had to write some notes to avoid too much grunting and swearing
 in the next seventeen minutes 
 this is the first talk i 've given about this expedition and while we weren 't sequencing genomes or building space telescopes 
 this is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something that hadn 't been done before
 so i hope in that you might find some food for thought  
 it was a journey 
 an expedition in antarctica  the coldest  windiest  driest and highest altitude continent on earth it 's a fascinating place it 's a huge place it 's twice the size of australia a
 continent that is the same size as china and
  put together as an aside i have
 experienced an interesting phenomenon in the last few days something that i expect chris hadfield may get at ted in a few years ' time conversations that go something like this
  round trip on foot from the coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again in the process we broke the record for the longest
 polar journey in history by more than four hundred miles 
 for those of you from the bay area it was the same as
  walking from here to san francisco then turning around and walking back again  so as camping trips go it was
 a long one  and one i 've i 've seen summarized most succinctly here on the hallowed pages of
 business insider malaysia
  so eloquently about fear and about the odds of success and indeed the odds of survival 
 of the nine people in history that had attempted this journey before us none had made it to the pole and back and five had died in the process 
 this is captain robert falcon scott he led the last team to attempt this expedition scott and his rival sir ernest shackleton
  over the space of a decade  
 both led expeditions battling to become the first to reach the south pole to chart and map the interior of antarctica a place we knew less about at the time than the surface of the moon because we could see the moon through telescopes 
 antarctica was for the most part a century ago uncharted some of you may know the story  scott 's last expedition the terra nova expedition
  had a big team using ponies using dogs using petrol driven tractors  dropping multiple 
  depots of food and fuel through which scott 's final team of five would travel to the pole where they would turn around and ski back to the coast again on foot  
 scott and his final team of five arrived
  at the south pole in january one thousand nine hundred and twelve to find they had been beaten to it by a norwegian team led by roald amundsen who rode
 on dogsled scott 's team ended up on foot  and for more than a century this journey has remained unfinished scott 's team of five died
 on the return journey  and for the last
 decade i 've been asking myself why that is
 how come this has remained the high water mark scott 's team covered
  miles on foot no one 's come close to that ever since so this this is the high water mark of human
 endurance  human endeavor human athletic achievement in arguably the harshest climate on earth it was as if the marathon
 record has remained unbroken since one thousand nine hundred and twelve and of course some strange
 and predictable combination of
  and probably hubris led me to thinking i might be the man to try to finish the job  unlike
 scott 's expedition there were just two of us  
 and we set off from the coast of antarctica in october last year dragging everything ourselves a process scott called man hauling when
 i say it was like walking from here to san francisco and back  
 i actually mean it was like dragging something that weighs a shade more than the heaviest ever nfl player our sledges weighed two hundred kilos or four hundred
  and forty pounds each at the start the same weights that the weakest of scott 's ponies pulled
 early on we averaged zero point five miles per hour  
 perhaps the reason no one had attempted this journey until now in more than a century was that no one had been quite
 stupid enough
 to try  and while i can 't claim we were exploring in the
 in the genuine edwardian sense
  of the word we weren 't naming any mountains or mapping any any uncharted valleys
 i think we were stepping into uncharted territory in a human sense
  certainly if in the future we learn there is an area of the human brain that lights up when one curses oneself 
 i won 't be at all surprised 
 you 've heard that the average american spends ninety percent of their time indoors we didn 't go indoors for
  nearly four months  we didn 't see a sunset either it was 24 hour daylight  living conditions were quite spartan  
 i changed my underwear three times
 in one hundred and five days
 and tarka and i shared thirty square feet on the canvas 
 though we did have some technology that scott could never have imagined  and we blogged live every evening from the tent via a laptop and a
 custom made satellite transmitter all of which were solar powered we had a flexible photovoltaic panel over the tent and the writing was
 important to me as a kid  i was inspired by the
 literature of adventure and exploration and i think we 've all seen here this week the importance and the power
  of storytelling so we had some 21st century gear but the reality is that the challenges that scott faced
 were the same that we faced those of the weather
 and of what scott called glide  the amount of friction between the sledges and the snow  
 the lowest wind chill we experienced was in the 70s and we had zero visibility what 's called white out for much of our journey 
 we traveled up and down one of the largest and most dangerous
  world the beardmore glacier it 's one hundred and ten miles long most of its surface is what 's called blue ice you can see it 's a beautiful shimmering steel hard blue surface
 covered with thousands and thousands of crevasses  
 these deep cracks in the glacial ice up to two hundred feet deep planes can 't land here so we were
 at the most
  when we had the slimmest chance of being rescued we got to the south pole after sixty one days on foot  with one day off
 for bad weather and i 'm sad to say it was something of an anticlimax there 's a permanent american base the amundsen scott south pole station
 at the south pole they have an airstrip they have a canteen they have hot showers they have a post office a tourist shop a basketball court
 that doubles as a movie theater so it 's a bit
  different these days and there are also acres of junk i think it 's a marvelous thing that humans can exist three hundred and sixty five days of the year
 with hamburgers and hot showers and movie movie theaters  but it does seem to produce a lot of empty cardboard boxes you can see on the left of this photograph 
 several square acres of junk waiting to be flown out from the south pole  
 but there is also
 a pole at the south
  pole and we got there on foot  unassisted  unsupported by the hardest route nine hundred miles
 in record time dragging more weight than anyone in history and if we 'd stopped there and flown home which would have been the eminently sensible thing to do 
 then my talk would end here
 and it would end something like this if you have the right team around you the right tools  the right technology
 and if you have enough self belief and enough determination then anything is possible  
 but then we turned around and this is where things get interesting 
 high on the antarctic plateau  over ten thousand feet it 's very windy very cold very
  we were exhausted we 'd covered thirty five marathons we were only halfway  and we had a safety net of course of
 ski planes and satellite phones and live 24 hour tracking beacons that didn 't exist for scott but
 in hindsight  rather than making our lives easier  the safety net actually allowed us to cut things
 very fine indeed to sail very close to our absolute limits as human beings  and it is an exquisite form of torture
 to exhaust yourself to the point of starvation day after day while dragging a sledge full of food for years i 'd been writing glib
 lines in sponsorship proposals about pushing the limits of human endurance  but in reality that was a very frightening place to be indeed  
 we had
  before we 'd got to the pole two weeks of almost permanent headwind which slowed us down as a result  we 'd had several days of eating half rations we had a a finite amount of food in the sledges to make this journey so
 we were trying to string that out by reducing our intake to half
 the calories we should have been eating as a result we both became increasingly hypoglycemic we had low blood sugar levels
 day after day and increasingly susceptible to the extreme cold tarka took this photo of me one evening after
  passed out with hypothermia we both had
 repeated bouts of hypothermia something i hadn 't experienced before  and it was very humbling indeed as much as you might like to think as i do  
 that you 're the kind of person who doesn 't quit that you 'll go down swinging
  hypothermia doesn 't leave you much choice you become
 utterly
  's like being a drunk toddler you become pathetic
 i remember just just wanting to lie down and quit it was a peculiar  peculiar feeling and a real
 surprise to me to be debilitated to that degree  and then
 we ran out of food completely forty six miles short of the first of the
 depots that we 'd laid on our outward journey we 'd laid ten depots of food literally burying food and fuel for our return journey the fuel was for a cooker so you could melt snow to get water
 and
 i was forced to make the decision to call for
 a resupply flight a ski plane carrying
 eight days of food to tide us over that gap they took twelve hours to reach us from the other side of antarctica calling for that plane
 was one of the toughest decisions of my life and i sound like a bit of a fraud standing here now with a sort of belly
  i 've put on thirty pounds in the last three weeks being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar which is that i 've been hoovering up every
 hotel buffet that i can find but
 we were genuinely quite hungry and in quite a bad way
  i don 't regret calling for that plane for a second because i 'm still standing here alive with all digits intact telling this story
  but
 getting external assistance like that was was never part of the plan and it 's something my ego is still struggling with this was the biggest dream
 i 've ever had and it was so nearly perfect 
 on the way back down to the coast our crampons they 're the spikes on our boots that we have for traveling over this blue ice on the glacier broke on the top of the beardmore we still had one hundred miles to go downhill on very slippery
 rock hard blue ice they needed repairing almost every hour 
 to give you an idea of scale 
 this is looking down towards the mouth of the  beardmore glacier you could fit the entirety of manhattan in the gap on the horizon that 's twenty miles between mount hope
 and mount kiffin  i 've never felt as small
 as i did in
  we got down to the mouth of the glacier we found fresh snow had obscured the dozens of deep crevasses 
 one of shackleton 's men described crossing this sort of terrain as like walking over the glass roof of a railway station 
 we fell through
 more times than i can remember usually just putting a ski or a boot through the the snow  occasionally we went in all the way up to our
  but thankfully never deeper than that and
 less than five weeks ago after one hundred and five days we crossed this oddly inauspicious finish line  
 the coast of ross island on the new zealand side of antarctica you can see the ice in the foreground and the sort of rubbly rock
 behind that behind us lay an unbroken ski trail of nearly one thousand eight hundred miles we 'd made the longest ever polar journey on foot something i 'd been dreaming of doing for
 a decade
  and looking back i still stand by
 all the things i 've been saying for years about the importance
 of goals and determination and self belief but i 'll also admit that i hadn 't given much thought
 to what happens when
 you reach the all consuming goal
 dedicated most of your adult life to 
 and the reality is that i 'm still figuring that bit out 
 as i said  there are very few superficial signs that i 've been away i 've put on thirty pounds  i 've got some very faint probably covered in makeup now frostbite scars i 've got one on my nose one on each cheek from where the goggles are
  but
 inside i am a very different person indeed  if i 'm honest antarctica
 challenged me and
 humbled me so deeply that i 'm not sure i 'll ever be able to put it
 into words i 'm still struggling to piece together my thoughts that i 'm standing here telling this
 story is proof
 that we all can accomplish great things through ambition through passion
  through sheer stubbornness by refusing to quit  that if you dream something hard enough as sting said it does indeed come to pass  
 but i 'm also standing here saying 
 you know what that
 cliche
 about the journey being more important than the destination there 's something in that the closer i got to my finish line
  the more i started to realize that the biggest lesson that this very long very hard walk might be teaching me
 is that happiness is not a finish line that for us humans the
 perfection that so many of us seem to dream of might not ever be truly attainable  and that if we
  we might never feel it a lot of people have asked me what next right now i am very happy just recovering
 and in front of hotel
 buffets  but
 as bob hope put it  i feel very humble  but i think i have the strength of character to fight it
