  i started
 with paragliding paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider with the possibility to fly cross country distance just with the use of thermals
 to soar also different aerobatic maneuvers are
  possible with a paraglider  
 from there i started with skydiving in this picture you can see there is a four way skydive  four people flying together and on the left hand side
 it 's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump for the film itself and also for
 the judging from regular relative skydiving
  skydiving i went on to freeflying freeflying is more the 
 skydiving you can see the skydiver with the red suit  he 's in a  stand up position 
 the one with the yellow green suit he 's flying head down and that 's me in the background  carving around the whole formation
 freefall also with the helmet cam to film this jump 
 from freeflying i went on to skysurfing skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet you can imagine with this big 
 a skysurfing board there is a lot of force a lot of power of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning we call it
  from there i went on to wingsuit flying wingsuit flying is a suit  
 that i can make fly  just only with my body if i put some tension on my body  tension on my suit  
 i can make it fly and as you see
 the fall rate is
 much much slower because of the bigger surface with a proper body position i 'm able to really move forward to
  quite some distance this is a jump i did
 in rio de janeiro you can see the
 copacabana on the left hand side
 from there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving i went on to base jumping base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects
  earth meaning mountains cliffs it 's for sure for me it 's the ultimate feeling of
 being in free fall with all the visual references  so my goal soon was to
 discover new places that nobody had jumped before  so in summer two thousand i was the first to base jump the eiger north face in switzerland
  two years after this i was the first to base jump from matterhorn a very famous mountain that probably
 everybody knows in here 
 two thousand and five i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk and from the jungfrau  three very famous mountains in switzerland the special thing on these
  i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day
 in two thousand and eight i jumped the eiffel tower in paris 
 so with all this
 this knowledge i also
 wanted to to get into stunts  
 so with some friends we started to do different tricks like for example this jump here i jumped from a paraglider
 or here everybody
 everybody was freezing pretty much except me because it was very cold in austria where we did this filming everybody sitting in a basket  
 and i was on top of the balloon  ready to slide down with my
 with my skysurf board  
 or this jump from a moving truck on the
  highway 
 extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step if you really work hard on your skills
 and on your knowledge  of course you need to
  so i 'm training a lot you need to have the the best possible equipment  and
 probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills mental preparation and all this
 to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly  
 so for two thousand and nine i 'm training hard for my two new projects
 the first one i want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit and i want to set a new record with the longest distance ever flown
 for my second project  i have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before  
 so now 
 on the
  following movie you will see that i 'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in english  enjoy  and thank you very much
 the
 the
  i think we all might have some questions 
 question one  so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does because it it looks like it might ueli gegenschatz pretty much i believe this is probably the closest
 the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly
  this but how do you land ue parachute we have to open a parachute just seconds before  i would say impact it 's
 not possible to land a wingsuit yet jc yet  but people are trying are you among those you 're not going to commit are you among those trying to do it ue it 's a dream it 's a dream yeah 
 we 're still working on it and we 're developing the wingsuits to
  get better performance to get more knowledge  and
 i believe soon jc all right well we will watch this space but i have two more questions  what is the there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing
  see the the way where i was flying  that 's reason number one and reason number two it 's much easier for the camera guy to film
 if i 'm
 using smoke jc ah i see so the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked one more question what do you do to to cover your face because i just keep keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards are you in a helmet
  feeling would be with only goggles jc and is that how you usually fly ue usually i 'm wearing a helmet in the mountains i 'm always wearing a helmet because of landings
 usually it 's difficult it 's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings
 so you have to be prepared jc right now is there anything you don 't do do people come to you with projects and say
