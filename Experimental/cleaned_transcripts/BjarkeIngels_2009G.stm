  the public debate about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result the architectural object is the latest tower in london
 a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool so
 recently we asked ourselves
  if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of
 tell stories about architecture  and we discovered that we didn 't have to invent it
 it  it already existed in the form of a comic book  so we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes how our
  projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world 
 we call this comic book yes is more 
 which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes in this case it 's mies van der rohe 's less is more he triggered the modernist revolution  
 after him followed the
  a bore after him philip johnson sort of introduced 
 you could say promiscuity or at least openness to new ideas with i am a whore 
 recently obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis  
 and what we 'd like to say with yes is more is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant garde is almost always negatively defined as who or what we are against
  the cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment
  or this idea of the misunderstood genius  frustrated that the world doesn 't fit in with his or her ideas  
 rather than revolution  we 're much more interested in evolution this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising
  the changes of the world 
 in fact i actually think that darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process 
 his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work 
 as you can see a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings at each meeting there 's way too many ideas only the best ones can survive  
 and through a process of architectural selection we might choose a really beautiful model
 or we might have a very functional model we mate
  them they have sort of mutant offspring  and through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design 
 a very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in copenhagen 
 the design process was
 really tough almost like a struggle for survival  
 but gradually an idea evolved this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city sort of expanding
  the public space onto what we refer to as a scandinavian version of the spanish steps in rome  
 but sort of public on the outside as well as on the inside with the library  
 but darwin doesn 't only explain the evolution of a single idea as you can see  sometimes a subspecies branches off and quite often we sit in a design meeting
  there is this great idea it doesn 't really work in this context but for another client in another culture it could really be the right answer to a to a different question 
 so as a result we never throw anything out we keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity you never know when you might need it  
 and what i 'd like to do now in
  happenstance of the world  
 the first story starts last year when we went to shanghai to do the competition for the danish national pavilion for the world expo in two thousand and ten  and we saw this guy
 haibao he 's the mascot of the expo  and he looks strangely familiar  in fact he looked like a building we had designed for
  a hotel in the north of sweden when we submitted it for the swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme but it didn 't exactly look like something from the north of sweden 
 the swedish jury didn 't think so either  
 so we lost  but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said wow 
 that 's the chinese character for the word ' people ' 
 so apparently this is how you write people as in the people 's republic of china
  we even double checked  and at the same time we got invited to exhibit at the shanghai creative industry week  
 so we thought like this is too much of an opportunity  so we hired a feng shui master we scaled the building up three times to chinese proportions
  and went to china 
 laughter so the people 's building as we called it this is our two interpreters sort of reading the
  it went on the cover of the wen wei po newspaper which got mr liangyu chen the mayor of shanghai to visit the exhibition and we had the chance to explain the project  
 and he said shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers but to him it was as if
 the connection to the roots had been cut over
 and with the people 's building he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of china and the
  chen is now in prison for corruption 
 laughter but like i said haibao looked very familiar because he is actually the chinese character for
  and they chose this mascot because the theme of
 the expo is better city better life sustainability  
 and we thought sustainability has grown into being this sort of neo protestant idea that it has to hurt in order to do good  
 you know  you 're not supposed to take long warm showers 
 you 're not supposed to fly on holidays because it 's bad for the environment
  gradually you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life  so we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on
  examples where a sustainable city actually increases the quality of life  
 we also asked ourselves what could denmark possibly show china that would be relevant you know
 it 's one of the biggest countries in the world one of the smallest 
 china symbolized by the dragon denmark we have a national bird the swan 
 china has many great
  but we discovered that in the people 's republic public school curriculum they have three fairy tales by an tu sheng or hans christian anderson as we call him 
 so that means that all one point three billion chinese have grown up with the emperor 's new clothes the matchstick girl and the little mermaid 
 it 's almost like a fragment of danish culture integrated into chinese culture  the biggest tourist attraction in china is the great wall the great wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon
  that can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours  
 and it sort of shows the difference between these two cities copenhagen shanghai modern  european  
 but then we looked at recent urban development  and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street thirty years ago all bikes  no cars  this is how it looks today all traffic
  bicycles have become forbidden many places 
 meanwhile in copenhagen we 're actually expanding the bicycle lanes a third of all the people commute by bike  
 we have a free system of bicycles called the city bike that you can borrow if you visit the city 
 so we thought  why don 't we reintroduce the bicycle in china  
 we donate one thousand bikes to shanghai  so if you come to the expo go straight to the danish pavilion get a danish bike and then continue
  visit the other pavilions 
 like i said shanghai and copenhagen are both port cities  
 but in copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it 
 one of the first projects we ever did was the harbor bath in copenhagen sort of continuing the public realm into the water  
 so we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda images statements but no real experience 
 so just like with a bike we don 't talk about it you can try it 
 like with the water  
 instead of talking about it we 're going to sail a
  million liters of harbor water from copenhagen to shanghai  so the chinese who have the courage can actually dive in and feel how clean it is 
 this is where people normally object that it doesn 't sound very sustainable to sail water from copenhagen to china  
 but in fact
  the container ships go full of goods from china to denmark  and then they sail empty back so quite often you load water for ballast so we can actually hitch a
  ride for free  and in the middle of this sort of harbor bath we 're actually going to put
 the actual little mermaid
  so the real mermaid the real water and the real bikes  and when she 's gone  we 're going to invite a chinese artist to reinterpret her 
 the architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop of exhibition and bikes  
 when you go to the exhibition you 'll see the mermaid and the pool you
 walk around start looking for a bicycle on the roof jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo 
 so when we actually won the competition
 we had to do an exhibition in china explaining the project  and to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the
 chinese state censorship  the first thing  the china map missed taiwan  it 's a very serious political issue in china  
 we will add on 
 the second thing we had compared the swan to the dragon  and then the chinese state said suggest change to panda 
 so when it came out in denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument the national people 's party sort of
 rebelled against it they tried to pass a law against moving the mermaid
  so for the first time i got invited to speak at the national parliament 
 it was kind of interesting because in the morning from nine to eleven they were discussing the bailout package how many billions to invest in saving the danish economy  
 and then at eleven o 'clock they stopped talking about these little issues and then from eleven to one 
 they were debating whether or not to send the mermaid to china 
 but to conclude if you want to see the mermaid from may to december next year
 don 't come to copenhagen because she 's going to be in shanghai 
 if you do come to copenhagen  you will probably see an installation by ai weiwei the chinese artist 
 but if the chinese government intervenes it might even be a panda 
 so the second story that i 'd like to tell is actually starts in my own house  this is my apartment
  this is the view from my apartment  over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the leonardo dicaprio balcony  and
 they form this sort of
 vertical backyard where on a nice summer day you 'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of ten meters  
 the house is sort of a distortion of a square block trying to zigzag it to make sure that all of the
  apartments look at the straight views  instead of into each other  until recently this was the view from my apartment  onto this place where our client actually bought
 the neighbor site  and he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure  
 and we thought rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of
  turn all the apartments into penthouses put them on a podium of cars 
 and because copenhagen is completely flat if you want to have a nice south facing slope with a view you basically have to do it yourself 
 then we sort of cut up the volume so we wouldn 't block the view from my apartment 
 and essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments and up in the sun  you have a single layer of apartments
 all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle like a a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view and a sort of dense urban location
 this is our first architectural model  this is an aerial photo taken last summer  
 and essentially the apartments cover the parking  they are accessed through this diagonal elevator  it
  product from switzerland because in switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators 
 and the facade of the parking we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated so we needed to perforate it  
 and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic  naturally ventilated  rasterized image 
  to the project as the mountain 
 we commissioned this japanese himalaya photographer to give us this beautiful photo of mount everest making the entire building a three thousand square meter artwork 
 applause so if you go back into the parking into the corridors  it 's almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors 
  the wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades 
 if you go even further it turns into this green garden 
 and all the rainwater that drops on the mountain is actually accumulated and there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens in one or two years 
  sort of transform into a cambodian temple ruin completely covered in green 
  the mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy 
 this idea that you can actually create if not gold  then at least added value by mixing traditional ingredients like normal apartments and normal parking  
 and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don 't have to to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city they can actually have both
  as an architect it 's really hard to set the agenda you can 't just say that now i 'd like to do a sustainable city in central asia  
 because that 's not really how you get commissions
  you always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen and the sort of turmoil of the world
  one last example is that recently we like last summer we won the competition to design
 a nordic national bank this was the director of the bank
  when he was still smiling laughter
 it was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity  unfortunately it was the national bank of iceland 
 at the same time we actually had a visitor
 a minister from azerbaijan came to our office we took him to see the mountain  and he got very excited
 by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture because
  azerbaijan is known as the alps of central asia  so he asked us if we could actually imagine
 an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of azerbaijan
  so we took the commission
 and we made this small movie that i 'd like to show we quite often make little
  we always argue a lot about the soundtrack  but in this case it was really easy to to choose the song
 so basically baku is this sort of crescent bay overlooking the island of zira the island that we are planning almost like the diagram of their flag  
 and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of azerbaijan and reinterpret them into
  and architectural structures  inhabitable of
 human life then we place these mountains
 on the island surrounding this sort of central green valley almost like a central park  
 and what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert it has no vegetation it has no water it has no energy no resources  
 so we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem  exploiting wind
  energy to drive the desalination plants  and to use the thermal properties of water
 to heat and cool the buildings  and all the sort of excess
 freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape  gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green lush landscape 
 so you can say where
 an urban development normally happens at the expense
  of of nature in this case it 's actually creating nature  and the buildings they don 't only sort of
 invoke the imagery of the mountains  they also operate like mountains they create shelter from the wind  
 they accumulate the solar energy  they accumulate the water  
 so they actually transform
  the entire island into a single ecosystem
