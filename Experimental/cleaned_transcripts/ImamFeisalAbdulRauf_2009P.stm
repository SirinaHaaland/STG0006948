  i 'm
  speaking about compassion from an islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not
  fourteen chapters and each chapter begins
 with what we call the basmala  the saying of in the name of god  the all compassionate  the all merciful 
 or as sir richard burton
 not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor  
 but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of
  literature
 translates it in the name of god the compassionating  the compassionate 
 and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity god says to his prophet muhammad
 whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning with adam including noah  including moses
  moses  including abraham  including jesus christ  and ending with muhammad that 
 we have not sent you o muhammad except as a ' rahmah ' except as a source of compassion
 to humanity for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims whose
  and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet
 is to make ourselves as much like the prophet and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves
 with the attributes of god and because god himself said
 that the primary attribute of his is compassion
 in fact the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion
  therefore our objective and our mission must be to be
 sources of compassion  activators of compassion  actors of compassion
 and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good 
 but where where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world
 for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path  
 in every religious tradition there is the outer path
 and the inner path or the exoteric path and the esoteric path 
 the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or
 and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition  
 refer to teachings and examples of our prophet
 that teach us where the source of our problems lies  in one of the battles that the prophet waged
  we are returning
 from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle 
 and they said messenger of god  we are battle weary 
 how can we go to a greater battle he said 
 that is the battle of the self the battle of the ego 
  the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you has a story
 in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and he knocks on the door  and a voice answers
  as we might say in english  the voice says go away 
 after many years
 of training of disciplining 
 of search and struggle he comes back with much greater humility he knocks again on the door
  you o heartbreaker 
 the door swings open  and the voice says come in for there is no room in this house for two i 's
  spiritual path  in the presence of god  there is no room
 for more than one i and that is the i of divinity 
 in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant
  my creature my human creature  does not approach me
 by anything
 that is dearer to me
 than what i have asked them to do 
 and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean you want your employees your employees to do what you ask them to do  
 and if they 've done that  then they can do extra  but don 't ignore what you 've asked them to do
  to get nearer to me by doing more of what i 've asked them to do extra credit we might call it until i love him or love her  
 and when i love my servant god says i become
 the eyes by which he
 or she sees  the ears by which he or she listens
  the hand by which he or she grasps  and the foot
 by which he or she walks  and the heart
 by which he or she understands it is this merging
 of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions
 muslims regard jesus
 as the master of sufism  the greatest prophet and messenger who came
 to emphasize the spiritual path when he says i am the spirit  and i am the way and when the
  whoever has seen me has seen god it is because they became so much an instrument
 of god they became part of god 's team
 so that god 's will was manifest through them and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos 
 compassion on earth
 is given it is in us all we have to do is to get our egos out of the
  way  get our egotism out of the way  
 i 'm sure  probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you 
 have had what you might call a spiritual experience 
 a moment in your lives
 when for a few
  a minute perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolved and at
 that minute you felt at one
 with the universe
 one with that jug of water one with every human being one with the creator
 and you felt you were in the presence of power
 awe of the deepest love the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives 
 that is a moment
 which is a gift of god to us a gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes
  this is all you 
 this is all you  and this is all us  
 and us and i and us are all part of you  o creator 
  the objective the source of our being and the end of our journey you
 are also the breaker of our hearts you are the one
 whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose
 we shall die  and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again
 to account to god to what extent we have been
  compassionate beings our message today  
 and our purpose today  and those of you who are here today  and the purpose of this charter of compassion 
 is to remind for the koran
 always urges us
 to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth
 is within every human being 
 we know it all 
 we have access to it all jung may have called it the subconscious 
 through our subconscious in your dreams
  the temporary death 
 in our state of sleep we have dreams we have visions  we travel
 even outside of our bodies for many of us 
 and we see wonderful things  we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond
  the limitations of time as we know it  but all this is for us to
 glorify the name of the creator
 whose primary name is the compassionating  the compassionate god 
  whatever the name might be
 through which you name or access the presence of divinity it is the locus
 of absolute being absolute love and mercy and compassion and absolute knowledge and wisdom
  the language differs  
 but the objective is the same rumi has another story
 about three men a turk an arab and and i forget the third person but for my sake it could be a malay 
 one is asking for angur one is say an englishman one is asking for eneb
  not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages 
 there 's only one absolute reality by definition 
 one absolute being by definition  because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singular
 there 's this absolute concentration of being  
 the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute
 locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of
  also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human 
 for what defines humanity perhaps biologically 
 is our physiology  but god defines humanity
 by our spirituality by our nature
  the koran says  
 he speaks to the angels and says when i have finished the formation of adam from clay  
 and breathed into him of my spirit  then fall in prostration to him 
 the angels
 prostrate not before the human body  
 but before the human soul  why because the soul
  the human soul  embodies
 a piece of the divine breath a piece of the divine soul 
 this is also expressed
 in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image what is the imagery of god
  imagery of god
 is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love 
 and therefore  for us to be human
 in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human
 means that we too
 have to be proper stewards
 of the breath of divinity within us and seek to perfect within ourselves
 the attribute of being of being alive of beingness the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness 
 and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this
  is what i understand from my faith tradition  and this is what i understand
 from my studies of other faith traditions  and this is the common platform
 on which we must all stand  and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced that we
 can make a wonderful world
  and i believe personally that we 're on the verge
 and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about
 the prophecy of isaiah for he foretold of a period
  when people shall transform their swords into plowshares
 and will not learn war or make war anymore 
 we have reached a stage in human history
 that we have no option  
 we must we must
  control our egos whether it is individual ego  personal ego  family ego  national ego
 and let all be for the glorification of the one
