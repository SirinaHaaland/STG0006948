  i was in new york during hurricane sandy  and this little white dog called maui was staying with me  
 half the city was dark because of a power cut  and i was living on the dark side 
 now maui was terrified of the dark so i had to carry him up the stairs actually down the stairs first
  for his walk  and then bring him back up i was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day  
 and through all of this i had to hold a torch between my teeth  the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries
 and bread for a shower  i walked forty blocks to a branch of my gym  but these were not the major preoccupations of my day
  it was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices  i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points  
 i wasn 't the only one  even in the rain people stood between madison and 5th avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street
  had just reminded us
 that it was stronger than all our technology  and yet here we were obsessed about being wired 
 i think there 's nothing like a crisis to tell you what 's really important and what 's not 
 and sandy made me realize
 that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food
  and shelter 
 the self as we once knew it no longer exists  
 and i think that an abstract digital universe has become a part of our identity 
 and i want to talk to you about what i think that means 
 i 'm a novelist and i 'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common they 're both stories  interpretations 
 you and i can experience things without a story we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless
 but the larger sense that we have of our lives the slightly more abstract one is indirect 
 our story of our life is based on direct experience  but it 's embellished 
 a novel needs scene after scene to build and the story of our life needs an arc as well 
 it needs months and years  discrete moments from our lives are its chapters  but the story is not about these
  chapters it 's the whole book  
 it 's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness the victories and the disappointments  
 but it 's because how because of these and sometimes more importantly in spite of these we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves 
 our story therefore needs two dimensions of time a long arc of time that is our lifespan
  and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment 
 now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment  but the one that narrates needs several moments a whole sequence of them  
 and that 's why our full sense of self needs both
 immersive experience and the flow of time 
  the flow of time is embedded in everything in the erosion of a grain of sand in the budding
 of a little bud into a rose without it  we would have no music our own emotions and state of mind often encode time  
 regret or nostalgia about the past  hope or dread about the future  
 i think that technology has altered
  the overall time that we have for our narrative our lifespan has been increasing but the smallest measure the moment has shrunk  
 it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time  
 and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world 
 and this granular understanding has generated reams of data
 that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers
  of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen  
 science can do things with and in a picosecond but you and i are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second 
 you and i
 answer only to nature 's rhythm and flow to the
  the moon and the seasons  
 and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past the present and the future to see things for what they are to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations 
 we need time 's arrow to understand cause and effect not just in the material world but in our own intentions and our motivations 
 what happens
 when that arrow goes awry what happens when time warps so
  many of us today have the sensation that time 's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once 
 this is because time doesn 't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one
  we all know that the internet has shrunk space as well as time  far away over there is now here  news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether i 'm in new york or new delhi
 your last job your dinner reservations from last year your former friends lie on a flat plain with today 's friends because the internet also archives and it warps the past 
 with no distinction left between the past  the present and the future and the here or there we are left with this moment everywhere 
 this moment that i 'll call the digital now just how can we prioritize in the
  landscape of the digital now 
 this digital now is not the present because it 's always a few seconds ahead with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones 
 this isn 't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book  
 this now bears very little
 physical or psychological reference to our own state its focus instead is to distract us at every turn on the road 
 every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else are you reading an interview by an author why not buy his book  tweet 
  it  share it  like it  find other books exactly like his  find other people reading those books 
  choice is freedom but not when it 's constantly for its own sake not just is the digital now far from the present but it 's in direct competition with it 
 and this is because not just am i absent from it  but so are you not just are we absent from it but so is everyone else and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror  i
 i can order foreign language books in the middle of the night shop for parisian macarons and leave video messages that get picked up later at all times i can operate at a different rhythm and 
  pace from you while i sustain the illusion that i 'm tapped into you in real time  
 for some reason technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does  
 and then like an ironic slap in the face it makes it true 
 for example it 's said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets 
 now if this rift which is already so great in many parts of the world between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology isn 't somehow bridged
  will be ruptures between the digital and the real for us
 as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it 
 the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous 
 how does one live inside distraction 
 we might think that those younger than us those who are born into this will adapt more naturally
  possibly  but i remember my childhood i remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me 
 buda and pest were separated by the danube and vienna had a spanish riding school 
 if i were a child today i could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks  but it really wouldn 't be the same because
  i went to vienna  and i went to the spanish riding school  and i could feel my grandfather right beside me 
 night after night he took me up on the terrace on his shoulders  and pointed out jupiter and saturn and the great bear to me 
 and even here when i look at the great bear i get back that feeling of being a child 
 hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder  
 and i can get back that feeling of being a child again what i had
  with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact  
 but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact
 time warping technology challenges our deepest core because
 we are able to archive the past
 and some of it becomes
  as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable  
 we want to clutch and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments they 're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them  by archiving everything 
 we think that we can store it  but time is not data it cannot be stored 
  it might have happened while we were playing an instrument or looking into the eyes of someone we 've known for a very long time  
 at such moments our selves are complete the self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one  
 the present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future  
 the present joins a flow of time from before and after i first experienced these feelings with my grandmother  i wanted to learn to skip and she found
  an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it  i wanted to learn to cook and she kept me in the kitchen cutting cubing and chopping
 for a whole month 
 my grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take that time can 't be fought  
 and because it will pass and it will move we owe the present moment our full attention attention is time 
 one of my yoga
  instructors once said that love is attention and definitely from my grandmother love and attention were one and the same thing 
 the digital world cannibalizes time  and in doing so i want to suggest
 that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves  it threatens the flow of love but we don 't need to let it  we can choose
  otherwise  we 've seen again and again just how creative technology can be and in our lives and in our actions we can choose
 those solutions and those innovations
 and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it  we can slow down and we can
  the ebb and flow of time  we can choose to take time back thank you
