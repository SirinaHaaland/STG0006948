  that was me in front of our house in monson massachusetts last
  after an ef3 tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off i decided to stay in massachusetts instead of pursuing the master 's program i had moved my boxes home that afternoon for morgan o 'neill 
 so on june one we weren 't disaster experts but on june three  we started faking it this experience changed our lives and now we 're trying to change
  tornadoes don 't happen in massachusetts 
 and i was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill  after a lamppost flew by my family and i sprinted into the basement 
 trees were thrown against the house the windows exploded when we finally got out the back door  transformers were burning in the street mo
 i was here in boston  i 'm a phd student at mit and i happen to study atmospheric science  actually it gets weirder
  i was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit playing with the tornado display 
 so i missed her call i get a call from caitria hear the news  and start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area
 i drove home late that night with batteries and ice  
 we live across the street from a historic church that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm 
 it had become a community gathering place overnight the town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits and so people wanting to help or needing
  information went to the church co 
 we walked to the church because we heard they had hot meals but when we arrived  we found problems there were a couple large sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church but nobody knew where to send 
  them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet as we watched they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own mo 
  and then armed with just two laptops and one air card  we built a recovery machine co 
 that was a tornado and everyone 's heading to the church to drop things off and volunteer mo everyone 's donating clothing  we should inventory the donations 
 piling up here  co and we need a hotline can you make a google voice number mo sure and we need to tell people what not to bring i 'll make a facebook
  can you print flyers co yeah but we don 't even know what houses are accepting help we need to canvas and send out volunteers mo we need to tell people what not to bring  hey there 's a news truck i 'll tell them co 
 you got my number off the news we don 't need more freezers
  donate three water heaters but someone needs to come pick them up co my car is in my living room mo 
 my boyscout troop would like to rebuild twelve mailboxes co my puppy is missing and insurance doesn 't cover chimneys mo my church group of fifty would like housing and meals for a week while we repair properties 
 co you sent me to that place on washington street yesterday  and now i 'm covered in poison ivy 
  to solve problems in a minute or less otherwise something more urgent would come up and it wouldn 't get done mo 
 we didn 't get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the united way we just started answering questions and making decisions because someone anyone had to 
 and why not me  i 'm a campaign organizer  i 'm good at facebook and
  the point is if there 's a flood or a fire or a hurricane you or somebody like you are going to step up and start organizing things 
 the other point is that it is hard mo 
 lying on the ground after another 17 hour day caitria and i would empty our pockets and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched in order to help someone 
  after another day and a shower at the shelter we realized it shouldn 't be this hard co 
 in a country like ours where we breathe wi fi leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no brainer systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time 
 and if some community member is in this organizing position in every area after every disaster these tools should exist mo 
 i decided to stay in the country give up the master 's in moscow and to work full time to make this happen in the course of the past year we 've become experts in the field of community powered disaster recovery and there are three main problems that we 've observed with the way things work currently mo 
 the tools large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster  
 but they often fulfill very specific missions and then they leave
 this leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers thousands of donations and all with no training and no tools so they use post its or excel or facebook 
 but none of these tools allow you to value high priority information amidst all of the photos and well wishes co 
 the timing 
 disaster relief is essentially a backwards
  a political campaign you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action you build both gradually until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election 
 in a disaster however you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity 
 and you 've only got about seven days to capture fifty percent of all of the web searches that will ever be made to help your area 
 then some sporting event happens and you 've got only the resources that you 've collected thus far to meet the next five years of recovery needs 
 this is the
  slide for katrina 
 this is the curve for joplin and this is the curve for the dallas tornadoes in april where we deployed software there 's a gap here  
 affected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit before they can start accepting help on their properties  and you 've only got about four days of interest in dallas mo 
 data  data is inherently unsexy but it can
  area 's recovery  
 fema and the state will pay eighty five percent of the cost of a federally declared disaster  leaving the town to pay the last fifteen percent of the bill now that expense can be huge  but if the town can mobilize 
 x amount of volunteers for y hours the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town 's contribution  
  now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you 've just sent out two thousand volunteers and you can 't prove it co 
 these are three problems with a common solution if we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together we can create new standards in disaster recovery mo 
 we needed canvasing tools donations databasing needs reporting  remote volunteer access all in an
  our software engineer and co founder has built these tools chris and bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships  and we 've been flying into disaster areas since this past january 
 setting up software training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters mo one of our first launches was after the dallas tornadoes this past
  we flew into a town that had a static outdated website and a frenetic facebook feed trying to structure the response and we launched our platform 
 all of the interest came in the first four days  but by the time they lost the news cycle that 's when the needs came in yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they 've been able to meet the needs of their residents co 
 so it 's working but it could be better
 emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place
  before a disaster  so that 's what we 're working on we 're working on getting the software to places so people expect it so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that 
 that drives recovery mo it
 's not rocket science 
 these tools are obvious and people want them in our hometown we trained a half dozen residents to run these web tools on their own because caitria and i live here in boston they took to it immediately
  of nature there are over three volunteer groups working almost every day and have been since june one of last year to make sure these residents get what they need and get back in their homes they have hotlines and spreadsheets and data co and that makes a difference 
 june one this year marked the one year anniversary of the monson tornado and our community 's never been more connected
  or more empowered 
 we 've been able to see the same transformation in texas and in alabama because it doesn 't take harvard or mit to fly in and fix problems after a disaster it takes a local no 
  matter how good an aid organization is at what they do they eventually have to go home  but if you give locals the tools
