  big idea is a very very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas
 that are at the moment dormant inside us  and my little idea that will do that is sleep
 this is a room of type a women  
 this is a room of 
  women  
 and i learned the hard way the value of sleep two and a half years ago i fainted from
  i hit my head on my desk i broke my cheekbone i got five stitches on my right eye  
 and i began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep  
 and in the course of that i studied i met with medical doctors scientists and i 'm here to tell you
 that the way to a more productive  more inspired  more joyful life is getting enough sleep
 and we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution this new feminist issue 
 we are literally going to sleep our way to the top literally
  has become a virility symbol  
 i was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before  and i felt like saying to him but i didn 't say i felt 
  like saying you know what if you had gotten five this dinner would have been a lot more interesting 
 there is now a kind of sleep deprivation
 especially here in washington if you try to make a breakfast date and you say how about eight o 'clock they 're likely to tell you eight o 'clock is too late for me but that 's ok  i can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight 
 and they think that means they are so incredibly busy and productive but the truth is they 're
  at the moment have had
 brilliant leaders in business in finance in politics making terrible decisions 
 so a high iq does not mean that you 're a good leader  because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the titanic 
 and we 've had far too many icebergs hitting our titanics in fact
  a feeling that if lehman brothers was lehman brothers and sisters they might still be around while all
 the brothers were busy just being
  seven  maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg because she would have woken up from a 
  and have been able to see the big picture so as we are facing all the multiple crises
 in our world at the moment 
 what is good for us on a personal level what 's going to bring more joy  gratitude  effectiveness in our lives
 and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the
  i urge you
 to shut your eyes 
 and discover the great ideas that lie inside us to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep thank you
