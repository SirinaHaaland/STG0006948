  and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight  but
 when qatar will host the football world cup ten years from now
 we already heard it will be in the hot very hot and sunny
 summer months of june and july  and when qatar has been assigned to the world cup all many people around the world have been wondering how would it be possible
 that football players show spectacular football
  run around in this desert climate  how would it be possible that spectators sit enjoy themselves
 in open air stadia in this hot environment  
 together with the architects of albert speer  & partner 
 our engineers from transsolar have been supporting have been developing open air stadia based
 on one hundred percent solar power on one hundred
  solar cooling let me tell you about that but let me start with comfort let me start with the aspect of comfort because many people
 are confusing
 ambient temperature with thermal comfort  
 we are used to looking at charts like that and you see this red line showing the air temperature in june and july and yes that 's right it 's picking up to forty five degrees  c it 's actually
  air temperature is not
 the full set of climatic parameters which define comfort  let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different 
 football world cups olympic games around the world looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort
  and let me start with mexico mexico temperature has been air temperature has been something between fifteen up to thirty degrees c and people enjoyed themselves it was a very comfortable game
 in mexico city have a look orlando same kind of stadium open air stadium  
 people have been sitting in the strong sun in the very high humidity in the afternoon and they did not enjoy it was not comfortable the air temperature was not too high but it was not
  during these games what about 
 because of broadcast rights all the games have been in the late afternoon sun has already been set  so the games have been perceived as comfortable  
 what about athens  mediterranean climate  
 but in the sun it was not comfortable they didn 't perceive comfort  and we know that from spain we know that
 sol y sombra if you have a ticket  and you get a ticket for the shade you pay more 
 because you 're in a more comfortable environment  
 what about beijing  it 's again sun in the day and high humidity and it was not comfortable so if i overlay and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes what we see is in all these places air temperature
  has been ranging something from
 to thirty five and if you go on the line thirty of thirty degrees c ambient temperatures if you go along that line you see
 there has been all kind of comfort  all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort  ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable  
 so why is that 
 this is
  because there are more parameters influencing our thermal comfort  which is the sun the direct sun the diffuse sun  which is wind  strong wind  mild wind  
 which is air humidity  which is the radiant temperature of the surroundings where we are in 
 and this is air temperature all these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body
 and scientists have developed a parameter which is the perceived temperature 
 where all these parameters go in and help designers
 to understand which is the driving parameter that i feel comfort or that i don 't feel comfort which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived
  climatic parameters are related
 to the human metabolism  
 because of our metabolism  we as human beings  we produce heat 
 i 'm excited i 'm talking to you i 'm probably producing one hundred and fifty watts at the moment you are sitting you are relaxed you 're looking at me it 's probably one hundred watts each person is producing
  and we need to get rid of that energy i need with my body to get rid of the energy and the harder it is for myself for my body to get rid of the energy the less comfort i feel that 's it 
 and if i don 't get rid of the energy 
 i will die  
 if we overlay what happens during the football world cup what will happen in june july we will see
  air temperature will be much higher  but because the games and the the plays will be in the afternoon  
 it 's probably the same comfort rating we 've found in other places which has perceived as
 so we sat together with a team which prepared the bid book or goal that we said let 's aim for perceived temperature for outdoor comfort in this range  which is perceived with a temperature of
  celsius perceived temperature which is extremely comfortable people would feel really fine in an open outdoor environment  but what does it mean if
 we just look on what happens we see temperature 's too high  if we apply the best architectural design climate engineering design  we won 't get much better
  so we need to do something active we need for instance to bring in radiant cooling technology  and we need to combine this with so called soft conditioning and how does it look like in a stadium  
 so the stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort first of all  
 it 's shading it needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong
  but that 's not all what we need to do we need to
 use active systems instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium  
 we can use radiant cooling technologies like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor and just by using 
  cold water going through the water pipes you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium so you can create that comfort
 and then by adding dry air instead of down chilled air 
 the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs to their
 individual energy balance they can adjust and find their comfort they need to find
  training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train we applied the same concept shading of the training pitch using a shelter against wind  
 then using the grass
 natural watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature  and using dehumidified air to create comfort  
 but even the best passive
  design wouldn 't help we need active system  and how do we do that 
 our idea for the bid was one hundred percent solar cooling based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia we cover the roofs of the stadia with pv 
  systems  we don 't borrow any energy from history  we are not using fossil energies
  we are not borrowing energy from our neighbors we 're using energy we can harvest on our roofs and also on the training pitches which will be covered with 
 large  flexible membranes and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics giving the possibilities of shading against strong 
  sun and producing electric energy in the same time and this energy now is harvested throughout the year  sent into the grid
  is replacing fossils in the grid and when i need it for the
 cooling  i take it back from the grid and i use the solar energy which i have brought to the grid back when i need it for the 
  solar cooling  and i can do that in the first year and i can balance that in the next ten and the next twenty years 
  which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar the next twenty years this energy goes into the grid of qatar 
 so this thank you very much 
 this is not only useful for stadia  we can use that also 
  places and streets and we 've been working on the city of the future in masdar  which is in the united emirates abu dhabi and i
 i had the pleasure to work on the central plaza and the same idea to use there to create outdoor conditions which are perceived as comfortable people enjoy going there instead 
  of going into a shopping mall which is chilled down and which is cooled we wanted to create an outdoor space which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early afternoon even in these sunny and hot summer months  and they can
  and the same concept  shade against the sun  shade against the wind  and use 
 use and take advantage of the sun you can harvest on your footprint  
 and these beautiful umbrellas  
 so i 'd like to encourage you
 to pay attention to your thermal comfort to your
  and if you 'd like to learn more about that i invite you to go to our website  we uploaded a very simple perceived temperature calculator where you can check out about your outdoor comfort 
 and i also hope that you share the idea that
 if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters
  will be possible
 to create
 really good and comfortable outdoor conditions to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable
 in an outdoor environment  
 and we can do that with the best passive design  but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun
