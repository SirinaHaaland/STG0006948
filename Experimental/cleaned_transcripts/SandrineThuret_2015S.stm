  still some confusion about that question as this is a fairly new field of research for example  i was talking to one of my
  and he was telling me 
 sandrine this is puzzling some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression 
 and i responded to him well from my point of view that makes sense the drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying
 also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain
 and then robert looked at me like i was crazy and said but sandrine these are adult patients adults do not grow new nerve cells 
 and much to his surprise i said well actually we do and this is a phenomenon that we call
  medical school
 he was not taught what we know now that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells  
 so robert you
 know being the good doctor that he is wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better and i took
  of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis
 and this is the hippocampus  so this is this gray structure in the center of the brain 
 and what we 've known already for very long is that this is important for learning memory mood and emotion  
 however what we have learned more recently
 is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new
  neurons can be generated  and if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in what you actually see here in blue
 is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain  
 so when it comes to the human brain my colleague jonas frisn from the
  that we produce seven hundred new neurons per day in the hippocampus 
 you might think this is not much compared to the billions of neurons we have but by the time we turn fifty we
 will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure
 with adult born neurons so why are these new neurons important and what are their functions
  first we know that they 're important for learning and memory and in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain
 to produce new neurons in the hippocampus then we block certain memory abilities  
 and this is especially new and true for spatial
 recognition so like how you navigate your way in the
  city 
 we are still learning a lot  and neurons are not only important for memory capacity but also for the quality of the memory 
 and they will have been helpful to add time to our memory and they will help differentiate very similar memories like how do you find your bike that you park at the station
 every day in the same area  but in a slightly different position
 and more interesting to my colleague robert is the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression  
 so in an animal model of depression we have seen that we have a lower level
 of neurogenesis 
 and if we give antidepressants then we increase the production of these newborn neurons  and we decrease the symptoms of depression
  establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression  but moreover if you just block neurogenesis  
 then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant  
 so by then robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer 
 because the cancer drug had stopped
  newborn neurons from being generated  and it will take time to generate
 new neurons that reach normal functions  
 so 
 collectively now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation
 or mood or even prevent the decline associated with aging
  or associated with stress  
 so the next question is can we control neurogenesis 
 the answer is yes  and we are now going to do a little quiz 
 i 'm going to give you a set of behaviors and activities  and you tell me if you think they will increase
  increase the production of these new neurons  how about stress 
 yes  stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus  how about sleep deprivation  
  you are right it will increase the production of new neurons  however it 's all about balance here we don 't want to fall in a situation 
 about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation
  neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older  but it is still occurring  and then finally how about running
  i will let you judge that one by yourself  
 so this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors rusty gage from the salk institute showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons  
 and here you see a
  section of the hippocampus
 of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage  and the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons to be 
 and now you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage so you see the massive increase of the black
  but that 's not all 
 what you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus  so here we have a sample of diet
 of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy  and i 'm just going to point a few out
 to you calorie restriction of twenty to thirty percent will increase neurogenesis
  fasting spacing the time between your meals will increase neurogenesis  
 intake of flavonoids  which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries  will increase neurogenesis
 omega 3 fatty acids  present in fatty fish like salmon  will increase the production of these new neurons  
 conversely a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis
 ethanol intake of alcohol will decrease neurogenesis  
 however 
 not everything is lost resveratrol  which is contained in red wine has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons  
 so next time you are at a dinner party you might want to reach for this possibly
 let me point out the last one a quirky one so japanese groups are fascinated with food textures and they have shown that actually soft diet
 impairs neurogenesis  as opposed to food that requires mastication chewing or crunchy food  
 so all of this data  where we need to look at the cellular level has been generated using animal
 but this diet has also been given to human participants and what we could see
 is that the diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis  such as calorie restriction will improve memory capacity
  exacerbate symptoms of depression as opposed to omega 3 fatty acids which increase neurogenesis and also help
 to decrease the symptoms of depression
  so we think that the effect of diet on mental health on memory and mood is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus 
 and it 's not only what you eat  but it 's also the
  of the food when you eat it and how much of it you eat 
 on our side neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis we need to understand better the function of these new neurons  and how we can control their survival and their production 
 we also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of robert 's patients 
 and on your side i leave
  you in charge of your neurogenesis  thank you margaret heffernan 
 fantastic research sandrine now i told you you changed my life
 i now eat a lot of blueberries sandrine thuret very good mh i 'm really interested in the running
  do i have to run 
 or is it really just about aerobic exercise getting oxygen to the brain could it be any kind of vigorous exercise st so for the moment we can 't really say if it 's 
 just the running itself  but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production
