  you might be wondering why i 'm wearing sunglasses 
 and one answer to that is because i 'm here to talk about glamour  so we all think we know what glamour is here it is it 's glamorous movie stars like marlene
  and it comes in a male form too very glamorous  not only can he shoot  drive drink you know he drinks wine there actually is a little wine in there
 and of course always wears a tuxedo  but i think
 that glamour actually has a much broader meaning one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters but also comes in other forms a magazine 
  well it 's certainly not this one  this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand it 's all about sex tips
 sex tips are not glamorous and drew barrymore for all her wonderful charm is not glamorous either  but there is a glamour of industry  this is margaret  bourke white
  's one of her pictures she did fantastic glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places
  and there 's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur
 this is the hewlett packard garage we know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding  hewlett packard 
 there 's the glamour of physics what could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe  grand unification and 
 by the way it helps if you 're brian greene he has other kinds of glamour and there is of course  this glamour  this is very very
  what do we mean by glamour  well one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary  
 and it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary in this case the one thousand nine hundred and thirteen dictionary  because for centuries glamour had a very particular meaning and the word was actually used
 differently from the way we think
 you had a glamour  it wasn 't glamour as a quality you cast a glamour glamour was a literal magic spell not a metaphorical one the way we use it today but 
  a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent  celtic magic 
  deception this definition for any artificial interest in or association with an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified 
 but still  glamour is an illusion glamour is a magic spell
  when the witches cast a magic spell on you it was not in your self interest it was to get you to act against your interest  
 well of course in the 20th century glamour came to have this different meaning associated with hollywood and this is hedy lamarr hedy lamarr said anyone can look glamorous all you have to do is sit there and look stupid 
 but in fact with all due respect to hedy about whom we 'll hear more later there 's a lot more to it there was a tremendous amount of technical
 achievement associated with creating this hollywood glamour there were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make up experts you can go to the museum of hollywood history in hollywood and see 
  max factor 's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up so you 've got this highly stylized portrait of something that
  not entirely of this earth it was a portrait of a star and actually we see glamorized photos of stars all the time they call them false color  glamour is a form 
 of falsification  but falsification to achieve a particular purpose it
  process of idealization glorification and dramatization and it 's not just the case for people glamour doesn 't have to be people architectural photography julius schulman who has talked about transfiguration took this
 fabulous famous picture of the kauffman house architectural photography is extremely glamorous  it puts
  you into this special special world  this is alex ross 's comic book art which appears to be extremely realistic as part of his style is he 
  gives you a kind of realism in his comic art  except that light doesn 't work this way in the real world when you stack people in rows the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground but not in the world of glamour  
  which was telling us that glamour is back glamour is all about transcending the everyday  and i think that that 's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is  
 this is filippino lippi 's
 portrait of saint apollonia  and i don 't know who she is either but this is the [ 16th ] century equivalent of a supermodel it 's a very glamorous portrait why is it glamorous
  because she is beautiful but that does not make you glamorous that only makes you beautiful 
 she is graceful she is mysterious and she is transcendent and those are the central qualities of glamour 
 you don 't see her eyes they 're looking downward she 's not looking away from you exactly but you have to mentally imagine her world she 's encouraging you to
  contemplate this higher world to which she belongs where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture mel gibson 's passion 
  of the christ not glamorous that 's glamour that 's michelangelo 's pieta where mary is the same age as jesus and they 're both awfully happy and pleasant  
 mysterious a little bit distant that 's why often in these glamour shots the person is not looking at the audience it 's why
 sunglasses are glamorous but also not so far above us that we can 't identify with the person in some sense there has to be something like us  so as i say in religious art you
 know god is not glamorous god cannot be glamorous because god is omnipotent omniscient too far above us
  and yet you will see in religious art saints or the virgin mary will often be portrayed not always in glamorous forms
 as i said earlier  glamour does not have to be about people 
 but it has to have this transcendent quality what is it about superman aside from alex ross 's style which is very glamorous  one thing about superman is he makes you believe that a man can
  glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized perfect place  and this is one reason that
 modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous  the less experience we have with them the more glamorous they are so you can do a glamorized picture of a car  but you can 't do a glamorized picture of traffic you can do a glamorized picture of an
  but not the inside  the notion is that it 's going to transport you and the story is not about you know 
 the guy in front of you in the airplane who has this nasty little kid or the big cough 
 the story is about where you 're arriving or thinking about where you 're arriving  and this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling 
 this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period  but because
  streamlining it transports us from the everyday the same thing arches are very glamorous  
 arches with stained glass even more glamorous  staircases that curve away from you are glamorous  i happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because to me it captures the whole promise of the
 academic contemplative life but maybe that 's because i went to princeton anyway  skylines are super glamorous
  streets not so glamorous you know when you get actually to this town it has reality  the horizon the open road 
 is very very glamorous there are few things more glamorous than the horizon except possibly
 multiple horizons of course here you you don 't feel the cold  
  you just see the possibilities in order to pull glamour off you need this renaissance quality of sprezzatura which is a term coined by castiglione in his
 book the book of the courtier there 's the not glamorous version of what it looks like today after a few centuries  and sprezzatura is the art that conceals art  it makes 
  things look effortless you don 't think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress she just looks completely
  natural  and i remember reading  after the lara croft movies how angelina jolie would go home completely black and blue
  of course they covered that with make up because lara croft did all those same stunts but she doesn 't get black and blue because she has sprezzatura to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without
  and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour glamour is about editing how do you create the sense of transcendence the sense of evoking a perfect world the sense of you know 
 life could be better i could join this i could be a perfect person i could join this perfect world  we don 't tell you all the grubby details  
 now this was kindly lent to me by jeff bezos from last year  this is underneath jeff 's
  this is what the real world of computers lamps electrical appliances of all kinds looks like 
 but if you look in a catalog particularly a catalog of modern beautiful
 objects for your home it looks like this there are no cords look next time you get these catalogs in your mail you can usually figure out where they hid the cord  but there 's always this illusion that if you
 buy this lamp you will live in a world without cords and the same thing is true of if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer
 and even in these wireless eras you don 't get to live in the world without cords you have to have mystery and you have to have grace  and there she is grace this is the most 
 glamorous picture i think ever part of the thing is that in rear window the question is is she too glamorous to live in his world and the answer is no but of course it 's really just a movie here 's hedy lamarr
  again  and you know this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because like sunglasses it conceals and reveals at the same time translucence is glamorous that 's why 
  all these people wear pearls it 's why barware is glamorous glamour is translucent not transparent not opaque it invites us into the world but it doesn 't give us a completely clear picture  and i think if grace kelly
  is the most glamorous person maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous it has that sense of going
 up and away  and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were particularly going down and of course glass block has that sense of translucence translucence so this session 's
  supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour 's really partly about meaning all individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized
 in reality they have contradictions they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other whatever it is and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals and the way we deal with that is we
 we displace them we put them into a golden world an imagined world an age of heroes the world to come and in the life of an individual we often associate that with some object the white picket fence  
 the perfect house  the perfect kitchen no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen you know 
 you buy that viking range this is what your kitchen will look like the perfect love life symbolized by the perfect
  necklace the perfect diamond ring  the perfect getaway in your perfect car this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia
  the perfect office again no cords as far as i can tell
 and certainly no it doesn 't look a thing like my office i mean there 's no paper on the desk we want this golden world and some people get rich enough and if they have their ideals in a sort of domestic sense
  to acquire their perfect world  dean koontz built this fabulous home theater which is i don 't think accidentally in art deco style that symbolizes this sense 
  of being safe and at home this is not always good  because what is your perfect world what is your ideal and also what has been edited out is it something important 
  is a movie that is all about glamour i could do a whole talk on the matrix and glamour  it was criticized for glamorizing violence because look
 sunglasses and those long coats
 and of course they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world this is another margaret  bourke white photo this is from soviet union attractive i mean look how happy the people are and
  fan of peta but i think this is a great ad because what they 're doing is they 're saying your coat 's not so glamorous what 's been edited out is something important  
 but actually what 's even more important than remembering what 's been edited out is thinking are the ideals good  because
 glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive and it 's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor  this is from triumph of the will brilliant editing to cut together things
  there 's a glamour shot  national socialism is all about glamour  it was a very aesthetic ideology it was all about cleaning up germany  and the west and the world and ridding it of anything 
 unglamorous so glamour can be dangerous i think glamour has a genuine appeal has a genuine value i 'm not against glamour but there 's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life  and there is both a way
  to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it and that 's to take isaac mizrahi 's advice and confront the manipulation of it all and sort of admit that that manipulation is something that we enjoy but also
 enjoy how it happens and here 's hedy lamarr she 's very glamorous but you know she invented
