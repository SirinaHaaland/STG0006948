  this is my great uncle my father 's father 's younger brother his name was joe mckenna  he was
 a young husband and a semi pro basketball player and a fireman in new york city  family history
  says he loved being a fireman and so in one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight on one of his days off he elected to hang out at the firehouse 
 to make himself useful that day he started polishing all the brass  
 the railings on the fire truck the fittings on the walls  and one of the fire hose nozzles a giant heavy piece of metal 
 toppled off a shelf
 and hit him
  a few days later his shoulder started to hurt 
 two days after that he spiked a fever 
 the fever climbed and climbed his wife was taking care of him but nothing she did made a difference and when they got the local doctor in 
 nothing he did mattered either 
 they flagged down a cab
 and took him to the hospital the nurses there recognized right away
 that he had an infection what at the time they would have called blood poisoning and though they probably didn 't say it they would have known right away
 that there was nothing they could do 
 there was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cure infections didn 't exist yet  the first
  the first antibiotic was three years in the future 
 people who got infections either recovered if they were lucky or they died 
 my great uncle was not lucky  
 he was in the hospital for a week  shaking with chills  dehydrated and delirious sinking into a coma as his organs failed 
 his condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to
  dilute the infection surging through his blood nothing worked  he died  he was thirty years old 
 if you look back through history most people died the way my great uncle died 
 most people didn 't die of cancer or heart disease  the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the west today 
 they didn 't die of those diseases because
  they didn 't live long enough to develop them 
 they died of injuries being gored by an ox  shot on a battlefield 
 crushed in one of the new factories of the industrial revolution
 and most of the time from infection which finished what those injuries began 
 all of that changed when antibiotics arrived
 suddenly infections that had been a death sentence became something you recovered from in days 
 it seemed like a miracle and ever since we have been living inside the golden epoch
 of the miracle drugs and now we are coming to an end of it my great uncle died in the last days of the
  era we stand today on the threshold of the
  era in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one joe had
 will kill people
 once again in fact 
 they already are people are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance
  briefly it works like this bacteria compete against each other
 for resources for food by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other 
 other bacteria to protect themselves  evolve defenses against that chemical attack 
 when we first made antibiotics we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them and bacteria responded
 to our attack the way they always had  here is what happened next  penicillin was distributed in
  one of the most recent drugs in two thousand and three  and resistance to it just a year later in two thousand and four 
 for seventy years  we played a game of leapfrog
 our drug and their resistance and then another drug and then resistance again
 and now the game is ending bacteria develop resistance
 so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest  
 so there are infections moving across the world for which 
 out of the more than one hundred antibiotics available on the market 
 two drugs might work
 with side effects or one drug or none this is what that looks like
  in two thousand the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc  identified a single case in a hospital in north carolina
 of an infection resistant to all but two drugs today that infection known as
 has spread to to every state but three and to south america  europe and the middle east
  thousand and eight  doctors in sweden diagnosed a man from india with a different infection resistant to all but one drug
 that time the gene that creates that resistance known as 
 has now spread from india into china asia  africa  europe and canada and the
  it would be natural to hope
 that these infections are extraordinary cases  but in fact  in the united states and europe  
 fifty thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help 
 a project chartered by the british government known as the review on antimicrobial resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now
  is seven hundred thousand deaths a year that is a lot
 of deaths 
 and yet  the chances are good that you don 't feel at risk that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units
 or nursing home residents near the ends of
  people whose infections are remote from us in situations we can 't identify with 
 what you didn 't think about none of us do is that antibiotics support
 almost all of modern life 
 if we lost antibiotics  here 's what else we 'd lose first any protection for people with weakened immune systems
 cancer patients  aids patients
  transplant recipients  premature babies 
 next  any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body  stents for stroke  pumps for diabetes  
 dialysis  
 joint replacements how many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees a recent study estimates that without antibiotics one out of
 would die 
 next we 'd probably lose surgery  
 many operations are preceded by prophylactic doses of antibiotics without that protection  
 we 'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body  
 so
 no heart operations no prostate biopsies
 'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor  strep throat
 used to cause heart failure  
 skin infections led to amputations  giving birth killed  in the cleanest hospitals almost one woman out of every one hundred 
 pneumonia took three children out of every ten 
  anything else we 'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives  if you knew
 that any injury could kill you would you
 ride a motorcycle bomb down a ski slope  
 climb a ladder to hang your christmas lights  let your kid
 slide into home plate
  after all the first person to receive penicillin a british policeman named albert alexander 
 who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye 
 was infected by doing something very simple 
 he walked into his garden
 and scratched his face on a thorn
  that british project i mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll right now is seven hundred thousand deaths a year also predicts that if we can 't get this under control
 by two thousand and fifty not long the worldwide toll will be ten million deaths a
  how did we get to this point
 where what we have to look forward to is those terrifying numbers  the difficult answer is we did it to ourselves 
 resistance is an inevitable biological process but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it 
 we did this by squandering
  was sold over the counter until the  1950s in much of the developing world most antibiotics still are 
 in the united states  fifty percent
 of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary forty five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor 's offices
 are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help
 and that 's just in healthcare 
 on much of the planet most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives not to cure illnesses  but to fatten them up
 and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in in the united states  possibly eighty percent
 of the antibiotics sold every year go
 to farm animals not to humans  creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm
 in water  in dust  in the meat the animals become  
 aquaculture depends on antibiotics too  particularly in asia  and fruit growing relies on
  and because
 bacteria can pass their dna to each other
 like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport 
 once we have encouraged that resistance into existence there is no knowing where it will spread 
 this was predictable in fact  it was predicted
 by alexander fleming  the man who discovered penicillin  he was given the nobel prize in 
 in recognition and in an interview shortly after this is what he said the thoughtless person
 playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of a
  i hope this evil
 can be averted can we avert it 
 there are companies working on novel antibiotics things the superbugs have never seen before 
 we need those new drugs badly  and we need
  to lure other companies into making antibiotics again
  but that probably won 't be enough  
 here 's why  
 evolution always wins 
 bacteria birth a new generation every twenty minutes it takes pharmaceutical chemistry ten years to derive a new
  every time we use an antibiotic we give the bacteria
 billions of chances to crack the codes of the defenses we 've constructed  there has never yet been a drug
 they could not defeat this is asymmetric warfare but
 we can change the outcome  we could build systems to harvest data to tell
  us automatically and specifically
 how antibiotics are being used  we could build gatekeeping into drug order systems so that every prescription gets a second look  
 we could require
 agriculture to give up antibiotic use  
 we could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next
  those are the tech solutions they probably aren 't enough either  unless we
 help 
 antibiotic resistance is a habit  we all know how hard it is to change a habit  
 but as a society we 've done that in the past 
 people used to toss litter
  litter into the streets used to not wear seatbelts used to
 smoke
 inside public buildings  
 we don 't do those things anymore  
 we don 't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer 
 because we decided those things were
 expensive
  not in our best interest  
 we changed social norms  
 we could change social norms around antibiotic use too  
 i know that the scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming 
 but if you 've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb because you were concerned about climate change or read the label on a box of
  crackers because you think about the deforestation from palm oil you already know what it feels like
 to take a tiny step
 to address an overwhelming problem  
 we could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too  we could forgo
 giving an antibiotic if we 're not sure it 's the right one
 we could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid 's ear infection
 before we 're sure what caused it  we could
 ask every restaurant every supermarket where their meat comes from  we could promise each other
 never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine
  antibiotic use  and if we did those things we could slow down the arrival
 of the post antibiotic world but
 we have to do it soon penicillin began the antibiotic era in one thousand nine hundred and forty three in just seventy years 
  we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster we won 't get seventy years
 to find our way back out again thank you very much
